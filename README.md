# 🧠 PrompTrend: Community-Driven Black-Box Benchmarking for LLM Vulnerabilities

**PrompTrend** is a research-driven framework for identifying, scoring, and benchmarking adversarial vulnerabilities in black-box LLM APIs across major platforms. It leverages community-shared prompts from Reddit, GitHub, Discord, forums, and Twitter to simulate real-world attack surfaces and analyze model behavior through transformation-based adversarial testing.

## ▶️ Usage

### Run a specific agent:
```bash
python -m agents.reddit_agent.cli start
python -m agents.github_agent.cli start

```

### Run the full data collection pipeline:
```bash
python main.py
```

### Run the full benchmark:
```bash
python scripts/run_execution_benchmark.py --input-dir Data/vulnerabilities_collected --enable-transformations
```

### Run the benchmark on a subset of files and specific models with selected transformations:
```bash
python scripts/run_execution_benchmark.py --input-dir Data/vulnerabilities_collected \
  --max-files 2 \
  --models azure-gpt-4 azure-gpt-45 \
  --enable-transformations \
  --transformation-strategies pad paraphrase split roleplay jailbreak_prefix reverse encode obfuscate step_by_step
```

> You can customize `--max-files`, `--models`, and `--transformation-strategies` to control benchmarking scope.

### Recalibrate PVAF scores:
```bash
python benchmarks/recalibrate_pvaf.py --input results.json
```
> PVAF Recalibration is done automatically when running benchmarks. You can use this to recalibrate the PVAF scores without model attacks.

## 📊 PVAF Scoring System

The **PrompTrend Vulnerability Assessment Framework (PVAF)** evaluates each vulnerability using six comprehensive dimensions across two distinct phases:

### Phase 1: Collection-Time Scoring (3 Dimensions)
During initial data collection, vulnerabilities are assessed using:

| Dimension              | Description                                | Weight |
|------------------------|--------------------------------------------|--------|
| Harm Potential         | Potential for societal or model-level harm | 34%    |
| Exploit Sophistication| Technical complexity of the exploit         | 33%    |
| Community Adoption     | Spread across online communities           | 33%    |

**Purpose**: Rapid triage and prioritization of newly discovered vulnerabilities for immediate attention.

### Phase 2: Post-Benchmark Recalibration (6 Dimensions)
After execution against model benchmarks, scoring expands to the full framework:

| Dimension              | Description                                      | Weight |
|------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|--------|
| Harm Potential         | Refined based on actual model outputs           | 20%    |
| Exploit Sophistication| Validated against real model behavior           | 20%    |
| Community Adoption     | Updated with cross-platform propagation data    | 15%    |
| Cross-Platform Efficacy| Success rate across different model families   | 15%    |
| Temporal Resilience    | Persistence despite security updates           | 15%    |
| Propagation Velocity   | Speed of spread across platforms and communities| 15%    |

**Purpose**: Comprehensive risk assessment incorporating real-world execution data and temporal evolution patterns.

### Scoring Pipeline

### Risk Classifications

| Score Range | Classification | Action Required |
|-------------|----------------|-----------------|
| 81-100      | Severe Risk    | Immediate escalation |
| 61-80       | Critical Risk  | Priority investigation |
| 41-60       | High Risk      | Scheduled analysis |
| 21-40       | Moderate Risk  | Routine monitoring |
| 0-20        | Low Risk       | Archived |

### Dynamic Modifiers

The framework applies contextual modifiers based on:
- **Temporal factors**: Age, recency, persistence
- **Platform factors**: Source credibility, reach, engagement patterns
- **Technical factors**: Novel attack vectors, evasion techniques
- **Impact factors**: Target model families, deployment contexts

> **Implementation**: Core logic in `processors/pvaf/`, with dimension calculators in `processors/pvaf/dimensions/` and modifier system in `processors/pvaf/modifiers/`.

## 🔄 Lifecycle of Vulnerabilities

PrompTrend classifies vulnerabilities along a five-stage evolution pipeline:

1. **Initial Discovery** – Prompt is first posted in a niche community
2. **Technical Implementation** – Concrete exploit or code shared
3. **Community Refinement** – Others improve or reframe it
4. **Widespread Dissemination** – Appears across platforms
5. **Mainstream Adoption** – Targets commercial models or APIs widely

This lifecycle is tracked using metadata, cross-referencing, and semantic fingerprinting.

## 🧪 Benchmarking Strategy

PrompTrend evaluates vulnerabilities across:

- **9 commercial LLMs** (OpenAI GPT-4.5, Claude 4, etc.)
  - *Note: Client files for models majority are implemented - add API keys and update benchmark script for additional model tests*
- **70+ transformation strategies** (e.g., obfuscation, roleplay, padding, reverse, paraphrasing)
- **Real-world community prompts** from active communities
- **Total of 200,000+ model invocations** across testing phases

### Evaluation Metrics

- **Jailbreak success/failure** rates per model
- **Filter evasion** effectiveness
- **Transformation robustness** across techniques
- **Model-specific weakness** profiles and patterns

---

## ✅ Results Summary

- **91%** of real-world prompts successfully jailbreak at least one model
- **66.7%** overall defense effectiveness across all models
- **PVAF correlation** with real-world success
- **Top bypass techniques**: roleplay, obfuscation, and split attacks
- **Model variance**: Success rates vary significantly between model families

---

## ⚠️ Limitations

- **GitHub code-based attacks** not yet fully supported by PVAF scoring
- **Data quality**: Occasional noisy or partial data from Reddit and Discord
- **Manual curation**: Prompt extraction may require manual review due to informal language
- **API dependencies**: Rate limits may affect large-scale data collection
- **Temporal coverage**: Historical data availability varies by platform

---

## 🔮 Future Work

- **Enhanced PVAF**: Add extensions for source-code-based exploit analysis
- **Semantic fingerprinting**: Integrate better prompt normalization techniques
- **Open-source expansion**: Extend testing to open-source LLMs and local deployments
- **Co-evolution research**: Explore automated transformation-defense dynamics
- **Real-time monitoring**: Develop continuous vulnerability detection pipelines

---

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**API Key Errors**: Ensure all required API keys are properly configured in `.env` files
**Rate Limiting**: Reduce `--max-files` or add delays between requests
**Memory Issues**: For large datasets, consider processing in smaller batches

### Support
