          "response": "<exact_text_with_citation>\nThe report provides a comprehensive analysis of the current state of renewable energy adoption in the United States. It examines the key drivers and barriers to the widespread adoption of renewable energy sources, such as solar, wind, and hydroelectric power. The report highlights the significant progress that has been made in recent years, with renewable energy sources now accounting for a growing share of the country's total electricity generation (1). However, the report also identifies several challenges that need to be addressed to further accelerate the transition to a more sustainable energy system.\n\nOne of the primary drivers of renewable energy adoption in the US is the growing public awareness and concern about the environmental impacts of fossil fuel-based energy generation, particularly in terms of greenhouse gas emissions and climate change (2). The report notes that there has been a significant increase in public support for renewable energy, with a majority of Americans now favoring the increased use of renewable energy sources over the expansion of fossil fuel extraction and use (3).\n\nThe report also examines the role of government policies and incentives in supporting the growth of the renewable energy sector. It highlights the importance of federal and state-level policies, such as renewable portfolio standards, tax credits, and net metering programs, in driving investment and innovation in renewable energy technologies (4). The report suggests that continued policy support and the removal of regulatory barriers will be crucial to ensuring the long-term viability and competitiveness of renewable energy in the US energy market (5).\n\nAdditionally, the report discusses the technological advancements and cost reductions that have made renewable energy more affordable and accessible to consumers and businesses. The report notes that the cost of solar photovoltaic (PV) systems, for example, has declined significantly in recent years, making solar energy a more attractive option for both residential and commercial applications (6). The report also highlights the potential of emerging technologies, such as energy storage and advanced grid management systems, to further enhance the integration and reliability of renewable energy sources in the electricity grid (7).\n\nOverall, the report paints a positive picture of the future of renewable energy in the United States, but also acknowledges the need for continued policy support, technological innovation, and public engagement to overcome the remaining challenges and accelerate the transition to a more sustainable energy future.\n\n(1) U.S. Energy Information Administration.

          "response": "<exact_text_with_citation>\nThe relationship between social media use and mental health among teenagers has become a critical area of research, with studies revealing complex and often concerning patterns. Research indicates that excessive social media use is significantly associated with increased rates of depression and anxiety among adolescents (Smith et al., 2023). The constant exposure to curated, idealized versions of others' lives can lead to harmful social comparisons, contributing to feelings of inadequacy and low self-esteem (Johnson & Lee, 2022).\n\nSleep patterns are particularly affected by social media use, with teenagers who spend more than three hours daily on social platforms showing significantly disrupted sleep cycles (Brown et al., 2023). The blue light exposure from screens, combined with the stimulating nature of social media content, can interfere with natural circadian rhythms and delay sleep onset (Martinez, 2022).\n\nHowever, the relationship is not entirely negative. Social media can provide valuable opportunities for social connection, especially for teenagers who may feel isolated in their immediate physical environment (Davis & Wilson, 2023). Online communities can offer support networks for young people dealing with specific challenges or interests that may not be readily available in their local communities.\n\nThe timing and context of social media use appear to be crucial factors. Passive consumption of content, such as endless scrolling through feeds, tends to be more strongly associated with negative mental health outcomes compared to active engagement through meaningful interactions and content creation (Thompson et al., 2022). Additionally, social media use immediately before bedtime shows the strongest correlation with sleep disruption and subsequent mood disturbances (Garcia, 2023).\n\nParents and educators are increasingly recognizing the need for digital literacy education that helps teenagers develop healthy relationships with social media platforms. Setting boundaries around usage time, encouraging critical thinking about online content, and promoting face-to-face social interactions remain important strategies for supporting adolescent mental health in the digital age.\n</exact_text_with_citation>",

Recent advances in machine learning and deep learning have enabled AI systems to analyze medical images, predict patient outcomes, and assist in clinical decision-making with increasing accuracy.<cite>[1,2]</cite>\n\nIn diagnostic imaging, AI algorithms have demonstrated remarkable capabilities. Studies show that deep learning models can detect diabetic retinopathy in retinal photographs with sensitivity and specificity matching or exceeding that of trained ophthalmologists.<cite>[1]</cite> Similarly, AI systems have achieved dermatologist-level performance in classifying skin cancer from clinical images.<cite>[1]</cite> These achievements suggest that AI could help address the global shortage of medical specialists, particularly in underserved regions.\n\nBeyond diagnostics, AI is revolutionizing drug discovery and development. Machine learning algorithms can analyze vast databases of molecular structures to identify potential drug candidates, significantly reducing the time and cost of bringing new medications to market.<cite>[2]</cite> AI models have successfully predicted drug-protein interactions and identified existing drugs that could be repurposed for new therapeutic applications.<cite>[2]</cite>\n\nHowever, the integration of AI in healthcare faces significant challenges. Data privacy and security remain paramount concerns, as medical AI systems require access to sensitive patient information.<cite>[3]</cite> There are also questions about liability when AI systems make errors in diagnosis or treatment recommendations. The \"black box\" nature of many deep learning algorithms makes it difficult to understand how they arrive at specific conclusions, raising concerns about transparency and accountability in clinical settings.<cite>[3]</cite>\n\nRegulatory frameworks are still evolving to address these challenges. The FDA has begun approving AI-based medical devices, but the regulatory pathway for continuously learning algorithms remains unclear.<cite>[3]</cite> There is an ongoing debate about how to ensure AI systems remain safe and effective as they learn from new data after deployment.\n\nLooking forward, the potential of AI in healthcare extends far beyond current applications. Researchers envision AI systems that could provide personalized treatment recommendations based on a patient's genetic profile, medical history, and lifestyle factors. AI could also play a crucial role in predicting and preventing disease outbreaks by analyzing patterns in population health data.\n\nThe successful integration of AI in healthcare will require collaboration between technologists, healthcare providers, regulators, and patients. As we navigate this transformation, it is essential to ensure that AI enhances rather than replaces the human elements of healthcare, maintaining the trust and empathy that are fundamental to the doctor-patient relationship.\n</exact_text_with_citation>",

AI technologies are increasingly being integrated into various sectors, including healthcare, finance, and transportation, leading to significant improvements in efficiency and productivity [1]. However, these advancements have also raised ethical questions regarding data privacy, algorithmic bias, and the potential for job displacement [2]. While AI-driven automation can streamline processes and reduce operational costs, it may also lead to workforce reductions in certain industries [2]. As a result, policymakers and stakeholders are working to develop guidelines and regulatory frameworks to ensure the responsible development and deployment of AI technologies [3]. Ongoing research in explainable AI and fairness is aimed at addressing some of these challenges, helping to build trust and transparency in AI systems [4].\n\nReferences:\n[1] Smith, J., & Lee, A.

Overwhelming scientific evidence indicates that human activities, particularly the burning of fossil fuels, have led to increased concentrations of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, driving global warming and altering climate patterns [1]. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) reports that average global temperatures have already risen by approximately 1.1°C above pre-industrial levels, resulting in more frequent extreme weather events, rising sea levels, and adverse impacts on ecosystems and human societies [1][2].\n\nMitigation strategies focus on reducing emissions through the adoption of renewable energy sources, improving energy efficiency, and promoting sustainable land-use practices [3]. Adaptation measures, such as building resilient infrastructure and developing early warning systems, are increasingly recognized as essential to address the unavoidable impacts of climate change [2]. International agreements like the Paris Agreement aim to limit global temperature rise to well below 2°C, with efforts to limit the increase to 1.5°C [1].\n\nDespite these efforts, significant challenges remain, including the need for large-scale transformation of energy systems, financial investments, and international cooperation [3]. Addressing climate change effectively will require coordinated action across sectors and scales, informed by the best available science and guided by principles of equity and sustainability [2][3].\n\nReferences:\n\n[1] IPCC.

Rising temperatures and shifting weather patterns are leading to more frequent and severe natural disasters, such as heatwaves, droughts, and floods, which can have devastating impacts on human populations.[1] Climate change is also contributing to the spread of infectious diseases, as warmer temperatures and changing precipitation patterns allow disease-carrying vectors like mosquitoes to expand their ranges.[2] Additionally, air pollution and exposure to environmental toxins, which are often exacerbated by climate change, have been linked to a range of negative health outcomes, including respiratory illnesses, cardiovascular disease, and cancer.[3] Vulnerable populations, such as the elderly, young children, and those living in poverty, are particularly at risk from the health impacts of climate change.[4] Addressing the public health challenges posed by climate change will require a comprehensive, global effort to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions and build resilient communities.[5]\n\n[1] Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC).

Among the various renewable energy technologies, solar photovoltaic (PV) systems have emerged as a promising solution due to their ability to generate clean, sustainable electricity from the sun's abundant and renewable energy.1 Solar PV systems work by converting the sun's energy into electrical energy through the use of photovoltaic cells, which are made from semiconductor materials that absorb sunlight and generate an electrical current.2 These systems can be deployed at various scales, from small rooftop installations to large-scale utility-scale solar farms, and have seen significant cost reductions and efficiency improvements in recent years.3 As a result, the global installed capacity of solar PV has grown rapidly, with an estimated 627 gigawatts (GW) of cumulative installed capacity worldwide as of 2020.4 The increasing adoption of solar PV is being driven by a combination of factors, including government policies and incentives, declining technology costs, and growing awareness of the environmental benefits of renewable energy.5 Looking ahead, the continued development and deployment of solar PV technology will play a crucial role in the transition towards a more sustainable energy future.\n</exact_text_with_citation>\n\n1.

This report examines the current applications, benefits, challenges, and future prospects of AI in healthcare.\n\nCurrent Applications of AI in Healthcare\n\nAI systems are increasingly being deployed across various healthcare functions. In clinical settings, machine learning algorithms can analyze medical images to detect abnormalities with accuracy comparable to human specialists. Deep learning models have demonstrated particular success in analyzing radiological images, including detecting tuberculosis from chest X-rays, identifying diabetic retinopathy from retinal scans, and classifying skin lesions from dermatological images.\n\nIn pharmaceutical research, AI accelerates drug discovery by predicting how different chemical compounds will interact with biological targets. This capability significantly reduces the time and cost associated with bringing new treatments to market. Additionally, AI-powered predictive analytics help healthcare providers anticipate patient deterioration, allowing for earlier intervention and potentially better outcomes.\n\nBenefits of AI in Healthcare\n\nThe integration of AI into healthcare systems offers numerous advantages. Perhaps most significantly, AI can improve diagnostic accuracy by identifying patterns in medical data that might elude human observation. This enhanced diagnostic capability may lead to earlier detection of diseases, potentially saving lives through timely intervention.\n\nAI systems also promote efficiency in healthcare delivery by automating routine tasks, allowing healthcare professionals to focus more on patient care. This optimization of workflow can reduce operational costs while simultaneously improving the quality of care. Furthermore, AI-enabled personalized medicine tailors treatments to individual patients based on their unique genetic makeup, medical history, and other personal factors, potentially increasing treatment efficacy.\n\nChallenges and Ethical Considerations\n\nDespite its potential benefits, the implementation of AI in healthcare faces significant challenges. Data privacy concerns are paramount, as AI systems require access to vast amounts of sensitive patient information. Ensuring the security of this data while maintaining its utility for AI applications presents a complex technical challenge.\n\nThe \"black box\" nature of many advanced AI algorithms poses another obstacle. Healthcare professionals may hesitate to trust AI recommendations without understanding the reasoning behind them, particularly when those recommendations contradict their clinical judgment. This lack of explainability complicates regulatory approval and clinical adoption.\n\nEquity in AI healthcare applications remains a critical concern. If AI systems are trained on datasets that underrepresent certain demographic groups, they may perform less effectively for those populations, potentially exacerbating existing healthcare disparities. Addressing this issue requires diverse training data and ongoing monitoring for algorithmic bias.\n\nFuture Prospects\n\nLooking ahead, AI is likely to become increasingly integrated into healthcare systems. Advances in natural language processing may enable more sophisticated analysis of clinical notes and medical literature, further enhancing diagnostic capabilities and treatment recommendations. The combination of AI with other emerging technologies, such as robotics and the Internet of Medical Things (IoMT), could revolutionize surgical procedures and remote patient monitoring.\n\nAs AI continues to evolve, healthcare regulations will need to adapt to ensure patient safety while enabling innovation. Developing appropriate frameworks for evaluating AI-based medical tools will be essential for realizing the full potential of these technologies in healthcare settings.\n\nConclusion\n\nAI has the potential to significantly improve healthcare outcomes through enhanced diagnostics, increased efficiency, and personalized treatment approaches. However, realizing these benefits will require careful navigation of technical, ethical, and regulatory challenges. With thoughtful implementation and ongoing evaluation, AI can serve as a powerful tool for advancing the quality and accessibility of healthcare worldwide.\n</synthesized_text>\n\n<exact_text_with_citation>\nThe Impact of Artificial Intelligence on Healthcare\n\nArtificial intelligence (AI) is transforming healthcare delivery across multiple domains.[1] This report examines the current applications, benefits, challenges, and future prospects of AI in healthcare.\n\nCurrent Applications of AI in Healthcare\n\nAI systems are increasingly being deployed across various healthcare functions.[1] In clinical settings, machine learning algorithms can analyze medical images to detect abnormalities with accuracy comparable to human specialists.[2] Deep learning models have demonstrated particular success in analyzing radiological images, including detecting tuberculosis from chest X-rays, identifying diabetic retinopathy from retinal scans, and classifying skin lesions from dermatological images.[2]\n\nIn pharmaceutical research, AI accelerates drug discovery by predicting how different chemical compounds will interact with biological targets.

If a sentence references multiple different sources, you can add more than one citation, but keep them minimal.  \n• Do not insert any additional text or change the existing wording/punctuation/spacing. Simply insert the citations in brackets, for example, “[1]” or “[Smith, 2021],” whichever format was specified.  \n\n━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━\n6) Keep the Text Unmodified, Except for Citations  \n━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━\n• Do not alter word choice, phrasing, or sentence structure of the <synthesized_text>.  \n• Carefully insert citations without adding or removing any other characters or whitespace.  \n\n━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━\n7) Output the Final Text with Citations  \n━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━\n• After thoroughly checking all sentence structures, place your newly cited text inside the <exact_text_with_citation> tags.  \n• Verify once again that the only additions are the bracketed citations, and that no spacing or punctuation within the original text has changed.  \n\n━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━\n8) Final Check  \n━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━\n• Ensure that you did not stray from the original instructions—no unauthorized modifications to text, no extra spaces, and correct citation placement.  \n• Confirm that each inserted citation is properly supported by the corresponding source.  \n\n━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━\n\nFollowing the steps above will produce the <exact_text_with_citation> output that meets the instructions: the text remains identical, citations are inserted appropriately, and the reader’s trust is enhanced by properly referencing the source material.",

Understand the Citation Guidelines:\n   - Only add citations where the source documents directly support specific claims.\n   - Ensure that citations are added at the end of complete thoughts or assertions rather than inserting them mid-sentence or on individual words.\n   - Prevent sentence fragmentation by minimizing multiple citations inside one sentence.\n   - Avoid redundant citations for multiple claims from the same source within a sentence.\n   - Maintain correct whitespace formatting.\n\n3. Read and Analyze the Provided Document:\n   - Carefully examine the content within the <synthesized_text> tags.\n   - Identify key assertions, factual statements, or conclusions that require verification or can be cross-checked using the relevant source documents.\n   - Discern which parts of the text are directly supported by the source material and prioritize those when inserting citations.\n\n4. Decide Where to Insert Citations:\n   - For every sentence or semantic unit that carries a significant claim or piece of evidence, determine if a citation from a provided source is necessary.\n   - Confirm that the referenced source fully backs the claim made in the sentence.\n   - Plan to place the citation immediately after the sentence’s punctuation (or at the end of the semantic block) without altering any whitespace or text content.\n\n5. Insert the Citations:\n   - For only the identified sentences, add the correct citation exactly in the format specified by previous instructions.\n   - Ensure that each citation is inserted without modifying the original text (the words, punctuation, and whitespace should remain 100% identical).\n   - Verify that multiple citations in a single sentence are avoided by consolidating claims supported by the same source into one citation placed at the end of the sentence.\n\n6. Generate the Final Output:\n   - After inserting citations where appropriate, wrap the entire resulting text (which retains its original content aside from added citations) inside <exact_text_with_citation> tags.\n   - Double-check that no extra spacing, additional formatting, or text modifications have occurred.\n\n7.

Les avancées récentes dans le domaine de l'apprentissage automatique, notamment avec les réseaux de neurones profonds, ont permis des progrès spectaculaires dans de nombreux domaines[1]. Ces technologies sont désormais capables de traiter des volumes massifs de données et d'identifier des patterns complexes que l'esprit humain ne pourrait pas détecter[1].\n\nDans le secteur de la santé, l'IA révolutionne le diagnostic médical. Les algorithmes peuvent analyser des images médicales avec une précision qui égale ou dépasse celle des radiologues expérimentés[2]. Par exemple, dans la détection du cancer du sein, certains systèmes d'IA atteignent des taux de précision supérieurs à 95%[2]. Cette capacité permet non seulement de détecter les maladies plus tôt, mais aussi de réduire les erreurs de diagnostic et d'améliorer les résultats pour les patients.\n\nL'impact économique de l'IA est également considérable. Selon les projections, l'IA pourrait contribuer jusqu'à 15,7 billions de dollars à l'économie mondiale d'ici 2030[3]. Cette croissance sera alimentée par l'automatisation des processus, l'amélioration de la productivité et la création de nouveaux produits et services[3]. Les entreprises qui adoptent l'IA constatent déjà des gains d'efficacité significatifs, avec des réductions de coûts pouvant atteindre 30% dans certains secteurs[3].\n\nCependant, cette révolution technologique soulève aussi des défis importants. La question de l'emploi est particulièrement préoccupante, car l'automatisation pourrait remplacer de nombreux postes de travail[4]. Les experts estiment que jusqu'à 40% des emplois actuels pourraient être automatisés dans les 15 prochaines années[4]. Cette transition nécessitera des efforts considérables en matière de formation et de reconversion professionnelle.\n\nLes questions éthiques liées à l'IA sont également cruciales. Les biais algorithmiques peuvent perpétuer ou amplifier les discriminations existantes[5]. De plus, la protection de la vie privée devient un enjeu majeur alors que les systèmes d'IA collectent et analysent des quantités massives de données personnelles[5]. Il est essentiel de développer des cadres réglementaires appropriés pour garantir que l'IA soit utilisée de manière responsable et équitable.\n\nEn conclusion, l'intelligence artificielle représente à la fois une opportunité extraordinaire et un défi considérable pour notre société. Pour maximiser ses bénéfices tout en minimisant ses risques, il est crucial d'adopter une approche équilibrée qui encourage l'innovation tout en protégeant les intérêts des citoyens. L'avenir de l'IA dépendra de notre capacité collective à naviguer ces complexités et à façonner son développement de manière éthique et inclusive.\n</text_with_citation>",

Однако внедрение ИИ сопровождается рядом вызовов, включая этические аспекты, вопросы конфиденциальности данных и необходимость интерпретируемости моделей [2]. Несмотря на эти трудности, исследования показывают, что интеграция ИИ в клиническую практику способствует сокращению времени постановки диагноза и улучшению исходов для пациентов [3]. Для дальнейшего успешного внедрения необходимо развитие стандартов регулирования и повышение квалификации медицинских работников в области цифровых технологий [4].\n</Synthesized_text>\n</eance_text_with_citation>",

Prioritize citing claims that readers would want to verify, that add credibility to the argument, or where a claim is clearly related to a specific source\n- **Cite meaningful semantic units**: Citations should span complete thoughts, findings, or claims that make sense as standalone assertions. Avoid citing individual words or small phrase fragments that lose meaning out of context; prefer adding citations at the end of sentences\n- **Minimize sentence fragmentation**: Avoid multiple citations within a single sentence that break up the flow of the sentence. Only add citations between phrases within a sentence when it is necessary to attribute specific claims within the sentence to specific sources\n- **No redundant citations close to each other**: Do not place multiple citations to the same source in the same sentence, because this is redundant and unnecessary.

The report finds that rising temperatures and changing precipitation patterns are leading to more frequent and severe droughts, which are negatively impacting agricultural productivity and food availability in the region (1). This is particularly concerning given that many countries in Sub-Saharan Africa already face high levels of food insecurity and malnutrition (2).\n\nThe report also highlights the disproportionate impact of climate change on vulnerable populations, such as smallholder farmers and pastoralists, who have limited resources to adapt to changing environmental conditions (3). Women, who play a crucial role in agricultural production and food preparation in the region, are especially affected by the consequences of climate change on food security (4).\n\nTo address these challenges, the report recommends a multi-pronged approach that includes investment in climate-smart agricultural practices, strengthening early warning systems, and expanding social safety nets and other forms of support for at-risk communities (5). Collaboration between governments, international organizations, and local stakeholders will be essential to ensure the successful implementation of these strategies (6).\n\nOverall, the research report provides a comprehensive analysis of the complex relationship between climate change and food security in Sub-Saharan Africa, and offers valuable insights to guide policymakers and development practitioners in their efforts to build resilience and ensure food security in the region.\n</exact_text_with_citation>\n\nCitations:\n(1) IPCC.

Focus on citing key facts, conclusions, and substantive claims that are linked to sources rather than common knowledge. Prioritize citing claims that readers would want to verify, that add credibility to the argument, or where a claim is clearly related to a specific source\n- **Cite meaningful semantic units**: Citations should span complete thoughts, findings, or claims that make sense as standalone assertions. Avoid citing individual words or small phrase fragments that lose meaning out of context; prefer adding citations at the end of sentences\n- **Minimize sentence fragmentation**: Avoid multiple citations within a single sentence that break up the flow of the sentence.

Let me carefully review the content and match it with the source documents.\n\n<exact_text_with_citation>\nThe relationship between sleep and cognitive function has been extensively studied across various populations and age groups. Research consistently demonstrates that adequate sleep plays a crucial role in memory consolidation, attention, and executive function.[1][2] Studies have shown that sleep deprivation can lead to significant impairments in cognitive performance, including reduced reaction times, decreased accuracy in decision-making tasks, and diminished working memory capacity.[3][4]\n\nIn adolescents, the impact of sleep on academic performance is particularly pronounced. A longitudinal study following high school students over two years found that those who consistently obtained less than 7 hours of sleep per night showed a 23% decline in grade point average compared to their well-rested peers.[5] Furthermore, irregular sleep patterns, such as those caused by late-night studying or social media use, have been associated with poorer academic outcomes and increased risk of mood disorders.[6][7]\n\nThe mechanisms underlying the sleep-cognition relationship involve complex neurobiological processes. During sleep, particularly during slow-wave sleep and REM stages, the brain consolidates memories and clears metabolic waste products that accumulate during waking hours.[8][9] Neuroimaging studies have revealed that sleep deprivation leads to reduced activity in the prefrontal cortex, a brain region critical for executive function and decision-making.[10] Additionally, chronic sleep loss has been linked to long-term structural changes in the brain, including reduced gray matter volume in areas associated with cognitive control.[11]\n\nInterventions aimed at improving sleep quality have shown promising results in enhancing cognitive performance. School-based programs that educate students about sleep hygiene and implement later school start times have demonstrated improvements in attention, academic performance, and overall well-being.[12][13] Similarly, workplace initiatives focusing on sleep health have been associated with increased productivity and reduced errors in performance-critical tasks.[14]\n\nThe implications of these findings extend beyond individual health to broader societal concerns. Sleep deprivation among healthcare workers, for instance, has been linked to increased medical errors and compromised patient safety.[15] In the transportation sector, drowsy driving accounts for approximately 20% of all motor vehicle accidents, highlighting the critical importance of adequate sleep for public safety.[16]\n\nFuture research directions include investigating the role of individual differences in sleep needs, the impact of modern technology on sleep patterns, and the development of personalized interventions to optimize sleep for cognitive performance. As our understanding of the sleep-cognition relationship continues to evolve, it becomes increasingly clear that prioritizing sleep is essential for maintaining optimal cognitive function throughout the lifespan.\n</exact_text_with_citation>",

They ensure that their modifications adhere 100% to the formatting rules (e.g., preserving the untouched text and wrapping the final result between <exact_text_with_citation> tags).\n\n4. Finally, the consultant outputs the finalized report wrapped in the <exact_text_with_citation> tags. This final version is identical in content to the original synthesized text except for the additional citations placed precisely where external support exists.\n\nIn other words, given proper input, they would produce an output document that looks like this:\n\n<exact_text_with_citation>\n[synthesized text with citations inserted at the appropriate sentences]\n</exact_text_with_citation>\n\nBy following these steps, the consultant realistically ensures that every claim in the report that is supported by a source is properly attributed, thereby enhancing user trust and maintaining the document’s integrity.",

These points address potential risks, controls, and process considerations.\n\n---\n\nRisk Assessment Meeting: Talking Points  \nTopic: Adding Correct Citations to Synthesized Research Reports\n\n1. Risk Identification\n\n- Risk of Incorrect Attribution: There is a risk of associating claims in the synthesized text with the wrong sources, which can undermine the credibility of the research report.\n- Omission of Required Citations: Omitting necessary citations for substantive claims may lead to accusations of plagiarism or inadequate scholarly rigor.\n- Over-citation or Redundancy: Excessive or redundant citations can clutter the report, reducing readability and user trust.\n- Modification of Source Text: There is a risk of unintentionally altering the <synthesized_text> content, which could compromise the fidelity of the original synthesis and breach compliance with stated rules.\n\n2. Controls and Mitigations\n\n- Strict Adherence to Citation Guidelines: Enforce rules to ensure citations are only added to complete semantic units, at logical points such as sentence ends, and only when claims are supported by provided sources.\n- Whitespace and Formatting Checks: Implement automated or manual checks to verify that no whitespace or content is added/removed except for the formatted citations.\n- Source-Claim Verification: Require double-checking that every citation directly corresponds to a claim supported by the source, avoiding unnecessary or unsupported citations.\n- Segregation of Duties: Consider peer review or double-checking by another agent before finalizing the <exact_text_with_citation> output.\n\n3. Process Safeguards\n\n- Training on Citation Best Practices: Ensure all agents are trained on distinguishing between common knowledge and citable claims, as well as on the provided citation format.\n- Audit Trail: Maintain logs of changes, including before-and-after snapshots of the text, to ensure accountability and facilitate troubleshooting if errors occur.\n- Exception Handling: Establish clear protocols for addressing ambiguous cases (e.g., when it is unclear if a claim should be cited).\n\n4. User Trust and Transparency\n\n- Clear Communication: Document and communicate the citation process and guidelines to stakeholders, explaining how and why citations are added.\n- Quality Assurance: Periodic audits of outputs to ensure sustained compliance with citation rules and quality standards.\n\n5. Residual Risks\n\n- Human Error: Even with controls, there is a residual risk of mis-citation or oversight.\n- Evolving Source Material: If source documents are updated or changed after synthesis, mismatches may occur unless there is version control.\n\n6. Recommendations\n\n- Continuous Improvement: Regularly review and update guidelines in light of user feedback and observed errors.\n- Technology Support: Explore automated tools for citation matching, but ensure human oversight for edge cases and nuanced judgment.\n\n---\n\nThese points should help you lead or contribute effectively to the risk assessment meeting, focusing on both potential pitfalls and the controls needed to maintain high standards and user trust in your citation process.",

The output text (within <exact_text_with_citation> tags) is otherwise identical to the input.\n- The agent must make careful, context-aware decisions about where to cite: not every sentence needs a citation, and citations should only be added where they enhance credibility or verifiability (for example, for key facts or claims that are not common knowledge).\n- Citations should be attached to complete, meaningful units of thought (usually at the end of a sentence), rather than to small fragments or individual words.\n- Within a single sentence, multiple citations are only used if different claims are supported by different sources, and redundant citations to the same source in close proximity are to be avoided.\n- The process is entirely source-driven: only source documents provided to the agent should be used for citation, and only when a direct and meaningful connection exists between a claim and a source.\n\nIn summary: Conceptually, you should think of this as a precise, source-sensitive “citation layer” applied to synthesized research text, designed to maximize both accuracy and user trust by transparently linking key claims to their supporting evidence, without otherwise altering the content or form of the original report.",

If different portions of a sentence draw on distinct sources, you may need to insert multiple citations—but strive to keep these insertions sparse to maintain readability.  \n• Adhere to formatting and style: Finally, ensure the citation style is consistent (e.g., [Source 1]) and respects instructions such as not introducing extra whitespace or otherwise altering the synthesized text.  \n\nFrom this conceptual vantage, your goal is always to enhance clarity and trustworthiness, without distracting readers through excessive or meaningless citations.",

Here is the report with the appropriate citations added:\n\n<exact_text_with_citation>\nThe effects of music on human cognition and behavior have been extensively studied. Research has shown that listening to music can have a significant impact on various cognitive processes, including attention, memory, and emotional regulation [1, 2]. Studies have demonstrated that music can enhance cognitive performance, particularly in tasks requiring spatial-temporal reasoning [3]. Additionally, music has been found to modulate brain activity, with different genres and styles of music eliciting distinct neural responses [4, 5].\n\nFurthermore, music has been shown to have therapeutic applications, with music therapy being used to alleviate symptoms of various medical and psychological conditions, such as depression, anxiety, and Alzheimer's disease [6, 7]. Listening to music has also been linked to the release of neurotransmitters, such as dopamine and serotonin, which are associated with positive mood and well-being [8, 9].\n\nOverall, the research suggests that music is a powerful tool for enhancing cognitive function, emotional regulation, and overall well-being. Understanding the mechanisms by which music affects the brain and behavior can have important implications for various fields, including education, healthcare, and cognitive science.\n</exact_text_with_citation>\n\nCitations:\n[1] Lesiuk, T.

It's a bridge between AI-generated content and verifiable information.\n\n## Key Conceptual Elements:\n\n### 1. **Preservation of Original Intent**\n- The synthesized text represents a specific interpretation/synthesis of sources\n- Adding citations without changing the text preserves this original synthesis while adding accountability\n\n### 2. **Selective Attribution**\n- Not everything needs citation (avoiding \"citation pollution\")\n- Focus on claims that are:\n  - Empirically verifiable\n  - Potentially controversial\n  - Central to the argument\n  - Specific rather than general knowledge\n\n### 3. **Semantic Integrity**\n- Citations should attach to complete thoughts, not fragments\n- This respects both readability and the logical structure of arguments\n\n### 4. **Minimal Intrusion**\n- Citations should enhance trust without disrupting reading flow\n- This is why redundant citations and over-fragmentation are avoided\n\n## Philosophical Framework:\n\nThis system embodies a **\"verification layer\"** approach to AI-generated content:\n- The AI synthesis provides accessibility and coherence\n- The citation layer provides verifiability and accountability\n- Together, they create content that is both useful and trustworthy\n\n## Practical Implications:\n\nThis approach acknowledges that:\n1. AI can effectively synthesize information\n2. Readers need to verify claims\n3. The balance between readability and verifiability is crucial\n4. Not all statements carry equal epistemic weight\n\nIn essence, this is about creating a **transparent chain of evidence** while maintaining the communicative effectiveness of the synthesized text.",

Modeling and worked examples – Begin by presenting annotated examples of synthesized texts with appropriate citations. This helps learners see concrete applications of the guidelines, such as adding citations after complete, self-contained claims (Doe, 2021).\n\n2. Scaffolded practice – Divide the task into smaller, manageable steps. For example, start with exercises that require adding citations to single-sentence claims before progressing to more complex, multi-sentence paragraphs. This gradual increase in complexity helps build confidence and competence (Smith, 2020).\n\n3. Interactive exercises with immediate feedback – Use online quizzes or guided annotation exercises where learners add citations and immediately receive feedback. This instant correction reinforces proper citation practices and helps students internalize the guidelines (Lee & Chen, 2019).\n\n4. Peer review and collaborative learning – Encourage learners to exchange annotated texts and discuss the rationale behind citation placements. This peer-to-peer engagement fosters a deeper understanding of proper attribution and helps identify subtle errors that automated systems might miss (Garcia, 2022).\n\n5. Reflective practice – Ask students to explain their citation choices in writing. By articulating why a particular citation was added, learners reinforce their understanding of linking claims to appropriate sources. This metacognitive approach not only bolsters citation skills but also deepens overall comprehension of scholarly communications (Brown, 2023).\n</exact_text_with_citation>",

          "response": "<exact_text_with_citation>\nThe field of artificial intelligence (AI) has seen a rapid expansion in recent years, with advancements in areas such as machine learning, natural language processing, and computer vision. AI systems have demonstrated impressive capabilities in a wide range of applications, from image recognition to game-playing to language generation. (1) However, the development and deployment of these systems also raise important ethical and societal considerations.\n\nOne key ethical concern is the potential for AI systems to perpetuate or amplify existing biases. (2) AI models are trained on data that can reflect societal biases, and if not carefully designed, these biases can be reflected in the outputs of the AI system. This can lead to unfair or discriminatory decisions, particularly in high-stakes domains like criminal justice, healthcare, and employment. (3)\n\nAnother important consideration is the transparency and interpretability of AI systems. Many modern AI models, such as deep neural networks, are complex \"black boxes\" that can be difficult for humans to understand and explain. (4) This lack of transparency can make it challenging to hold AI systems accountable and can erode public trust in these technologies. (5)\n\nThere are also concerns about the impact of AI on the job market and the potential for widespread job displacement as AI systems become more capable of automating tasks traditionally performed by humans. (6) While AI may create new job opportunities, there is a risk that the benefits of these technologies will not be evenly distributed, leading to increased economic inequality. (7)\n\nTo address these challenges, researchers and policymakers are exploring various approaches, such as developing ethical guidelines for AI development, implementing transparency and explainability measures, and exploring strategies for mitigating the potential negative impacts of AI on employment. (8) Ultimately, the responsible development and deployment of AI will require a multifaceted effort involving collaboration between technologists, ethicists, policymakers, and the broader public.\n</exact_text_with_citation>\n\nCitations:\n(1) Bostrom, N., & Yudkowsky, E.

Here's the typical process:\n\n## Expert Elicitation Process for Risk Assessment\n\n### 1. **Planning Phase**\n- Define the specific risk parameters or uncertainties to be assessed\n- Identify the expertise needed and recruit appropriate experts\n- Determine the elicitation method (e.g., Delphi method, structured interviews, group workshops)\n- Develop clear questions and protocols\n\n### 2. **Expert Selection**\n- Identify 5-15 experts with relevant domain knowledge\n- Ensure diversity of perspectives and backgrounds\n- Consider both academic and practical expertise\n- Obtain commitment and address any conflicts of interest\n\n### 3. **Preparation**\n- Brief experts on the context and objectives\n- Provide background materials and common definitions\n- Train experts on probability assessment if needed\n- Clarify the specific quantities to be elicited\n\n### 4. **Elicitation Methods**\nCommon approaches include:\n- **Individual interviews**: One-on-one structured discussions\n- **Delphi method**: Multiple rounds with anonymous feedback\n- **Group workshops**: Facilitated discussions with interaction\n- **Probability encoding**: Systematic assessment of uncertainty distributions\n\n### 5. **During Elicitation**\n- Use calibration questions to assess expert reliability\n- Apply debiasing techniques (e.g., considering alternative scenarios)\n- Document reasoning and assumptions\n- Allow experts to express uncertainty ranges, not just point estimates\n\n### 6. **Aggregation**\n- Combine expert judgments using mathematical methods (e.g., weighted averages, Bayesian approaches)\n- Consider both behavioral (consensus-seeking) and mathematical aggregation\n- Document areas of agreement and disagreement\n\n### 7. **Validation and Documentation**\n- Review results with experts for accuracy\n- Document the entire process transparently\n- Assess sensitivity of conclusions to expert judgments\n- Prepare clear communication of results and uncertainties\n\nWould you like me to elaborate on any specific aspect of this process?",

In other words, do not over-cite; only attach citations to claims, conclusions, or substantive assertions that would benefit from source verification.\n\n3. When inserting citations, cite complete, meaningful semantic units. This means you add citations at natural breaks (complete thoughts or assertions) rather than breaking sentences up or citing small phrases.\n\n4. You should minimize sentence fragmentation by avoiding the insertion of multiple citations into a single sentence unless necessary. Specifically, if a sentence includes multiple claims from the same source, use only one citation at the end of that sentence to avoid redundancy.\n\n5. Finally, you must ensure that you do not have redundant citations close together. This means if the same source supports multiple claims in a sentence, only one citation should be used to represent that source for that sentence.\n\nThese are the main functions (or rules) the agent must follow when adding citations to the report.",

At the same time, climate change is having a profound impact on agricultural production, with more frequent and severe weather events, droughts, and other disruptions affecting crop yields and food security.[1]\n\nAdditionally, unsustainable farming practices, deforestation, and other environmental issues are contributing to the depletion of natural resources and the degradation of ecosystems that are crucial for food production.[2] These challenges have led to a growing awareness of the need for a more sustainable and resilient global food system that can meet the world's food needs while also protecting the environment.\n\nOne potential solution to these challenges is the development of alternative protein sources, such as plant-based and cell-cultured meats. These alternative proteins have the potential to reduce the environmental impact of traditional animal-based proteins, while also providing a more secure and sustainable source of food.[3] Additionally, advances in precision agriculture, vertical farming, and other innovative technologies may help to increase food production while reducing the strain on natural resources.[4]\n\nHowever, the transition to a more sustainable global food system will require significant investment, policy changes, and collaboration among governments, businesses, and civil society. It will also require a shift in consumer behavior and a greater emphasis on sustainable and ethical food production practices.[5] Ultimately, addressing the challenges facing the global food system will be crucial for ensuring food security and environmental sustainability in the years to come.\n</exact_text_with_citation>",

Citation Format:**\n- Use the format that was specified (for example, [1], [2], etc.—this will match whatever style is indicated in the task, e.g., numbered brackets, (Author, Year), etc.).\n\n**3. Where to Add Citations:**\n- ONLY add a citation if the statement is directly supported by one of the provided sources.\n- Focus on:\n    - Key facts\n    - Conclusions\n    - Substantive claims that are not common knowledge\n    - Claims that a reader would want to verify\n    - Claims clearly related to a specific source\n- Avoid citing \"obvious\" statements or common knowledge.\n\n**4. How to Place Citations:**\n- Place the citation at the end of the sentence (after the period) that contains the claim, unless you need to distinguish between claims in the same sentence.\n- Cite the complete thought or claim, not just a word or tiny phrase.\n- Do not break up sentences with multiple citations unless you really need to attribute different parts to different sources.\n- Do not repeat citations to the same source within a single sentence.\n\n**5. Whitespace:**\n- Do not add or remove any spaces or line breaks in the text apart from adding the citation(s).\n- Keep all original formatting.\n\n**6. Output:**\n- Output only the modified report, with citations added, within <exact_text_with_citation> ... </exact_text_with_citation> tags.\n- Do not output anything else—no explanations, no extra text, just the tagged report.\n\n**Example:**\n\nInput (you receive):\n<synthesized_text>\nThe sky is blue.

          "response": "I’m sorry to hear you’re feeling anxious. Let me walk through these instructions step by step and clarify what they mean, so it’s hopefully easier to see how you would add the citations:\n\n1) You receive a text inside <synthesized_text> tags. That text was originally generated by pulling together information from several source documents, but it doesn’t yet include citations.\n\n2) Your job is to add citations into that text—without changing the original wording or whitespace—in such a way that each key claim, fact, or statement that originates from one of the sources is properly attributed.\n\n3) The idea is to “enhance user trust” by making the claims verifiable. Readers can see exactly which source supports a statement, so they know where it came from.\n\n4) You must maintain the 100% exact original text, simply inserting citations at the appropriate points (usually at the end of a sentence, unless there is a specific reason to cite a smaller portion within a sentence).\n\n5) The newly cited version of the text should be output inside <exact_text_with_citation> tags.\n\n6) There are a few specific guidelines about how to place citations:\n   • Cite only when the statement is not common knowledge or is a specific, important fact or claim.  \n   • Place the citation at a natural break—usually the end of the sentence—so you don’t interrupt the flow unnecessarily.  \n   • If multiple statements in one sentence come from the same source, you only need one citation at the end of the sentence. Don’t repeat citations for the same source in that same sentence.  \n   • Don’t break up a sentence unnecessarily with repeated short citations; only do so if different parts of the sentence come clearly from different sources.\n\n7) Finally, do not add or remove any whitespace. For instance, if there’s already a space, you keep it; if there isn’t, you don’t add one. This ensures that the text remains identical except for the citation markers.\n\nPutting it simply, your main goal is:\n• Identify any claim or statement in <synthesized_text> that you know comes from a source.  \n• Insert a citation marker in the correct format (for example, “(Source 1)” or “[1]”, depending on instructions) at the end of that claim or sentence.  \n• Make sure the text before and after these citation markers is unchanged—including spaces, punctuation, or line breaks.  \n\nI hope this breakdown helps lower the anxiety around these instructions. If you have a specific example or piece of text you’re working on, you could apply these steps to that text one sentence at a time. Let me know if there’s anything else you’d like me to clarify.

I want to help by clarifying what this “citation agent” does and how it works:\n\n• Your role (as the agent) is to take a research report that’s provided inside tags that look like this: <synthesized_text> … </synthesized_text>. This text is based on several source documents, but the citations that back up the claims in the report aren’t shown.\n\n• Your task is to add citations to the report exactly where the report makes claims or presents findings that are supported by those source documents. You’re not creating any new text; you only insert citations without altering any of the original content (including its spacing).\n\n• When inserting citations, you must follow a specific format. You add the citation at the end of the sentence or after a complete thought, making sure that the citation covers the whole claim and doesn’t break up the sentence unnecessarily.\n\n• Important rules include:\n  – Do not change the text in the <synthesized_text> at all except for adding the new citation markers.\n  – Be careful with whitespace so no extra spaces or line breaks are added or removed.\n  – Only add a citation when a part of the text clearly derives from one of the provided source documents.\n  – Avoid placing multiple citations for the same source back-to-back in one sentence. If there are multiple claims in one sentence that are supported by the same source, a single citation at the end of the sentence is sufficient.\n\n• Once you’ve added all the needed citations in the correct places, you wrap the entire modified text in <exact_text_with_citation> tags.\n\nThis step-by-step citation approach is meant to increase the trustworthiness of the report by clearly showing where every significant claim can be verified with the original sources, all while keeping the original content intact.\n\nI hope this explanation helps ease your anxiety by clarifying exactly what your responsibility is in this process.

          "response": "<exact_text_with_citation>\nThe recent advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) have led to the development of large language models (LLMs) that can generate human-like text on a wide range of topics. These models, such as GPT-3, have shown impressive capabilities in tasks like text generation, summarization, and translation. [1] However, the use of these models in sensitive domains like healthcare, finance, and national security raises concerns about the potential for misuse and the need for robust safeguards.\n\nOne of the key challenges with LLMs is their tendency to produce plausible-sounding but factually incorrect or biased information. [2] This can be particularly problematic in domains where the consequences of inaccurate information can be severe. For example, in a healthcare setting, an LLM-generated treatment recommendation could lead to harmful medical decisions. [3] Similarly, in finance, an LLM-generated investment advice could result in significant financial losses. [4]\n\nTo address these concerns, researchers and policymakers are exploring various approaches to ensure the responsible development and deployment of LLMs. [5] These include the development of robust evaluation frameworks, [6] the implementation of transparency and accountability measures, [7] and the establishment of ethical guidelines and governance frameworks. [8] Additionally, there is a growing emphasis on the importance of human oversight and the need for LLMs to be used in a complementary manner with human expertise, rather than as a replacement for it.

Studies have shown that rising temperatures, changing precipitation patterns, and increased frequency of extreme weather events can have significant impacts on crop yields and food production.[1] Warmer temperatures can lead to shifts in growing seasons, altering the optimal planting and harvesting times for certain crops.[2] Changes in rainfall patterns can also disrupt water availability for irrigation and lead to droughts or flooding that damage crops.[3] Additionally, the increased prevalence of pests and diseases associated with a changing climate can further threaten agricultural productivity.[4]\n\nThese climate-driven changes in agriculture have important implications for global food security and the livelihoods of millions of farmers around the world.[5] Developing countries that rely heavily on subsistence farming are particularly vulnerable to the impacts of climate change, as they often lack the resources and infrastructure to adapt to these changes.[6] Addressing the challenges posed by climate change in the agricultural sector will require a multifaceted approach, including the development of more resilient crop varieties, improved irrigation and water management practices, and policies that support sustainable farming methods.[7]\n</exact_text_with_citation>\n\n[1] Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC).

It provides an overview of the current situation, potential benefits and drawbacks of the proposed change, and recommendations for stakeholders.\n\nThe report begins by describing the existing conditions in the community, including the demographics, economic activities, and key infrastructure. It notes that the community has a population of approximately 15,000 people, with a median household income slightly below the national average.[1] The local economy is primarily driven by small businesses, with a mix of retail, professional services, and light manufacturing.[2]\n\nThe report then outlines the proposed policy change, which would involve rezoning a portion of the community to allow for the development of a large-scale commercial and residential complex. Proponents argue that this would bring new jobs, tax revenue, and economic growth to the area.[3] However, the report also highlights concerns raised by residents, such as the potential for increased traffic, strain on public services, and changes to the community's character.[4]\n\nIn evaluating the potential impacts, the report examines factors such as employment opportunities, tax revenue, housing affordability, and environmental sustainability. It concludes that while the proposed development could provide some economic benefits, there are also significant tradeoffs that must be carefully considered.[5] The report recommends that policymakers engage in further stakeholder consultation, conduct a comprehensive impact assessment, and explore alternative development scenarios that could better balance the needs of the community.[6]\n\n[1] U.S. Census Bureau.

Let me carefully review the text and match claims to their sources.\n\n<exact_text_with_citation>\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has fundamentally transformed the landscape of remote work, accelerating a shift that many experts believe will have lasting implications for how we conceptualize the workplace. Prior to 2020, remote work was largely viewed as a perk offered by progressive companies or reserved for specific roles. However, the pandemic forced a sudden, widespread adoption of remote work practices across industries and geographies.[1]\n\nThis rapid transition revealed several key insights about the nature of work itself. First, many jobs that were previously thought to require physical presence proved to be equally, if not more, productive in remote settings.[2] Technology companies like Twitter and Facebook announced permanent remote work options for employees, signaling a broader shift in corporate attitudes.[3] Studies conducted during this period found that productivity actually increased for many knowledge workers, with employees reporting fewer distractions and more focused work time.[2]\n\nHowever, the remote work revolution has not been without its challenges. The blurring of work-life boundaries has emerged as a significant concern, with many employees reporting difficulty \"switching off\" when their home became their office.[4] Mental health professionals have noted an increase in burnout and stress-related conditions, particularly among workers who struggle with the isolation of remote work.[5] Additionally, the lack of spontaneous interactions and \"water cooler\" conversations has raised concerns about innovation and company culture.[6]\n\nThe implications extend beyond individual workers to broader economic and social structures. Commercial real estate markets in major cities have experienced significant disruption, with office vacancy rates reaching historic highs.[7] This has prompted urban planners and policymakers to reconsider the future of city centers and the role of central business districts.[8] Some cities are exploring conversions of office buildings to residential use, while others are reimagining downtown areas as mixed-use neighborhoods.[9]\n\nLooking forward, most experts agree that we are unlikely to return to the pre-pandemic status quo. Instead, a hybrid model combining remote and in-office work appears to be emerging as the dominant paradigm.[10] This model attempts to balance the flexibility and autonomy that employees have come to value with the collaboration and social connection that physical workplaces provide.[11] Companies are redesigning office spaces to prioritize collaboration areas over individual desks, reflecting this new reality.[12]\n\nThe long-term success of remote and hybrid work models will likely depend on continued technological innovation, evolving management practices, and addressing the digital divide that excludes some workers from these opportunities.[13] As we move forward, the lessons learned during the pandemic will continue to shape our understanding of work, productivity, and the role of physical space in professional life.\n</exact_text_with_citation>",

Here's a concise and clear way to present your agent's citation-insertion method, based on the detailed rules you've given:\n\n---\n\nHello everyone,\n\nToday, I'll describe the approach used by our agent to enhance the credibility of research reports by adding appropriate citations. The agent's purpose is to ensure that any substantive claims or findings in a synthesized research report are properly attributed to their supporting sources, which builds trust and verifiability for readers.\n\nHere’s how the process works:\n\n1. **Input Structure**: The agent receives a research report within <synthesized_text> tags, and a set of supporting sources. The report was generated from these sources, but currently lacks inline citations.\n\n2. **Citation Insertion Process**:\n   - The agent carefully reads the text, identifying key facts, conclusions, or substantive claims that are directly supported by the provided sources.\n   - For each such claim, the agent adds a citation in the specified format at the end of the relevant sentence or semantic unit—ensuring that the citation covers a meaningful, complete thought rather than just a single word or fragment.\n   - The content within the <synthesized_text> tags is left completely unchanged except for the insertion of citations. No other edits are made, not even to whitespace.\n\n3. **Citation Guidelines**:\n   - Citations are added only where needed—common knowledge and non-controversial background information are left uncited.\n   - Redundant citations are avoided: if a sentence contains multiple claims from the same source, only one citation is added at the end.\n   - Where different parts of a sentence are supported by different sources, the agent may insert citations between phrases, but only if necessary for clarity.\n\n4. **Output Format**: The final report is output within <exact_text_with_citation> tags, containing the original text plus the newly inserted citations.\n\nThis approach ensures that the research report is both trustworthy and easy to read, with citations that support key claims and allow readers to verify the information themselves.\n\n---\n\nYou can customize this for your style or level of formality.

Parsing the Input\n- Extract the <synthesized_text> section: O(N)\n- Load source documents: O(M)\n\n## 2. Identifying Citable Units in the Synthesized Text\n- The algorithm must scan the synthesized text, likely sentence by sentence or by semantic units.\n- Let the number of sentences be K (K ≤ N, as sentences are a subset of the text).\n- Sentence segmentation: O(N)\n\n## 3. Matching Claims to Sources\n- For each potential citable unit (e.g., sentence), the algorithm must check if a claim is supported by any source.\n- The naive approach: For each sentence, compare against each source document (or relevant segments).\n  - For K sentences and S sources: O(K * S * C)\n    - C is the average cost of comparing a sentence to a source (e.g., via string matching, semantic similarity, etc.)\n\n- If semantic similarity is used (e.g., embedding-based cosine similarity), generating embeddings for all sentences and all source passages:\n  - Embedding generation: O(K + M) (assuming constant time per sentence/source chunk)\n  - Similarity computation: O(K * S) (assuming one chunk per source; more if chunked further)\n\n## 4. Deciding Where to Insert Citations\n- For each sentence, if a source supports it, decide where to insert the citation.\n- This is a constant time operation per citable unit given the earlier matching.\n\n## 5.

At a high level, the work that A must do is:\n\n1. Parsing the input to identify the boundaries of the synthesized text (and any other tagged or untagged elements). This parsing step can generally be done with a single pass over the text (O(n), where n is the length of the input).\n\n2. Analyzing the synthesized text to identify “meaningful semantic units” (for example, sentences or groups of sentences) that contain claims that might require citations. If the algorithm breaks the text into sentences, the cost here is also roughly linear (O(n)) with respect to the number of characters or tokens.\n\n3. For each candidate semantic unit, the algorithm must decide—based on a set of rules—whether a citation is warranted. In many implementations this involves comparing the claim to the supporting evidence in the provided source documents. Let s denote the number of source documents. In the simplest scheme, the algorithm could check each claim against the s sources in sequence. Assuming that a check between a unit of text and a source document is done in constant time (or using an efficient lookup/index structure), the cost for processing all claims is O(n · s). (If s is small or considered constant, this is effectively linear.)\n\n4. Once the matching has been determined, the algorithm inserts citation markers into the text. Since the rules dictate that the synthesized text itself may not be altered (other than adding citations), this is essentially an “overlay” process. Inserting markers at identified positions, given that these positions are determined in previous passes, can be done in a single additional pass—thus contributing no more than O(n).\n\nPutting it all together, the overall time complexity of algorithm A is dominated by the initial text scan plus the per-claim checks against the sources. In the worst case (if every sentence needs to be examined against every source), the time complexity is O(n · s). In practice, if the number of source documents s is relatively small or can be treated as constant, algorithm A behaves in linear time O(n) with respect to the input size.\n\nSimilarly, space complexity is largely determined by the need to store and process the input text and possibly additional data structures to mark candidate boundaries and citation locations, which again is O(n).\n\nIn summary, the computational complexity of algorithm A is:\n • Time Complexity: O(n · s) in the worst case (which is effectively O(n) if s is constant).\n • Space Complexity: O(n).",

Studies show that urban areas are responsible for the majority of greenhouse gas emissions, largely due to transportation and industrial activities [1]. As cities continue to expand, the implementation of green spaces and sustainable transport systems has become a critical strategy for mitigating environmental impacts [2]. Recent research highlights the positive correlation between urban greenery and reduced levels of airborne pollutants, demonstrating measurable improvements in respiratory health among residents [3]. Additionally, the adoption of electric public transit options has been shown to significantly lower urban carbon footprints [4]. However, challenges such as funding constraints and public resistance to policy changes remain obstacles to widespread adoption of these solutions [2]. \n\nSources:\n[1] Smith, J., & Lee, A. (2021).

Scenario 1 involved a controlled environment with minimal external interference, allowing for baseline performance assessment. Scenario 2 introduced network fluctuations to simulate real-world operating conditions. Scenario 3 incorporated adversarial inputs to test the system’s resilience to unexpected or malicious data. Finally, Scenario 4 combined multiple stressors, including peak loads and environmental disturbances, to push the system to its operational limits [1].\n\nIn each scenario, key performance indicators such as response time, accuracy, and fault tolerance were meticulously measured. The results demonstrated that the system maintained high accuracy and low latency in controlled and moderately disturbed environments. However, under combined stressors, a slight degradation in response time was observed, though accuracy remained within acceptable thresholds [2]. These findings suggest that the system is suitable for deployment in environments with variable operational stress, provided that critical thresholds are monitored and maintained.\n\n</exact_text_with_citation>",

Let me carefully review the text and match claims with their supporting sources.\n\n<exact_text_with_citation>\nThe Impact of Artificial Intelligence on Healthcare Diagnostics\n\nArtificial intelligence (AI) is revolutionizing healthcare diagnostics with unprecedented accuracy and efficiency. Recent studies demonstrate that AI systems can now detect certain cancers with accuracy rates exceeding 95%, surpassing many human specialists.[1] This technological advancement is particularly evident in radiology, where machine learning algorithms analyze medical images to identify subtle patterns that might escape human observation.[1][2]\n\nThe implementation of AI in diagnostic procedures has led to significant improvements in early disease detection. For instance, AI-powered screening tools have reduced diagnostic errors by up to 40% in preliminary studies, while simultaneously decreasing the time required for analysis by 60%.[3] These improvements are crucial in time-sensitive conditions where early intervention dramatically affects patient outcomes.\n\nHowever, the integration of AI into clinical practice faces several challenges. Healthcare professionals express concerns about the \"black box\" nature of many AI algorithms, where the decision-making process remains opaque.[4] Additionally, regulatory frameworks struggle to keep pace with rapid technological developments, creating uncertainty about liability and standards of care.[5] The cost of implementing AI systems, which can range from $500,000 to several million dollars for comprehensive platforms, presents another significant barrier for many healthcare facilities.[4]\n\nDespite these challenges, the potential benefits of AI in diagnostics continue to drive adoption. Studies indicate that hospitals using AI-assisted diagnostics report a 25% reduction in misdiagnosis rates and a 30% improvement in patient satisfaction scores.[3] Furthermore, AI systems can process thousands of cases simultaneously, addressing the growing shortage of specialized medical professionals in many regions.\n\nLooking forward, experts predict that AI will become an indispensable tool in healthcare diagnostics within the next decade. The technology's ability to continuously learn and improve from new data suggests that accuracy rates will only increase over time.[2] As regulatory frameworks mature and costs decrease through technological advancement, AI-powered diagnostics may become the standard of care, fundamentally transforming how diseases are detected and diagnosed.\n</exact_text_with_citation>",

Solar and wind power have seen dramatic cost reductions over the past decade, making them increasingly competitive with fossil fuels.[1][2] In many regions, renewable energy is now the cheapest source of new electricity generation.[1]\n\nGovernment policies play a crucial role in this transition. Feed-in tariffs, renewable portfolio standards, and carbon pricing mechanisms have been instrumental in driving adoption.[3] However, the intermittent nature of wind and solar power presents challenges for grid stability.[2] Energy storage technologies, particularly lithium-ion batteries, are becoming essential for managing this variability.[2]\n\nThe economic implications extend beyond the energy sector. The renewable energy industry has become a significant source of employment, creating millions of jobs worldwide.[3] Manufacturing, installation, and maintenance of renewable energy systems require a skilled workforce, driving demand for technical education and training programs.\n\nLooking ahead, the International Energy Agency projects that renewable sources could provide up to 90% of global electricity by 2050.[1] Achieving this will require continued technological innovation, supportive policies, and massive infrastructure investments. The transition represents not just an environmental imperative, but also an economic opportunity for countries that position themselves as leaders in clean energy technology.[3]\n</exact_text_with_citation>",

Studies also suggest that young adults and individuals with pre-existing mental health conditions experienced disproportionate negative effects compared to the general population [3]. Efforts to increase access to telemedicine and virtual mental health services helped mitigate some of these effects, although barriers such as digital literacy and unequal access to technology persisted [4].\n\nReferences:\n[1] World Health Organization.

Healthcare providers must navigate complex regulatory frameworks that vary significantly across jurisdictions, with some countries requiring extensive clinical trials before AI diagnostic tools can be deployed in clinical settings.[6][7] Additionally, the integration of AI into existing healthcare workflows demands significant infrastructure investments and comprehensive training programs for medical staff.[8] Patient privacy concerns also present ongoing challenges, as these systems require access to vast amounts of sensitive medical data to function effectively.[9]\n\nDespite these obstacles, the potential benefits of AI in healthcare continue to drive innovation and investment in the field. Early adopters have reported reduced diagnostic times, improved patient outcomes, and more efficient resource allocation within their healthcare systems.[10][11] As the technology matures and regulatory frameworks evolve to accommodate these new tools, we can expect to see increasingly sophisticated AI applications that not only diagnose diseases but also predict treatment outcomes and personalize therapeutic approaches based on individual patient characteristics.[12]\n</exact_text_with_citation>",

The report is provided within <synthesized_text> tags, and citations must be added based on the accompanying source documents. The output should be the exact same report but with citations inserted in the appropriate locations, wrapped in <exact_text_with_citation> tags.\n\n---\n\n## Processing Steps\n\n1. **Validate Input**\n   - Ensure the input contains a <synthesized_text> tag with the report text.\n   - Confirm that source documents are provided.\n\n2. **Execute Processing**\n   - Read the <synthesized_text> content.\n   - Identify key facts, conclusions, and substantive claims that require citations (i.e., those supported by the source documents).\n   - Insert citations at the end of relevant sentences or after semantic units, using the prescribed citation format (e.g., [1], [2], etc.).\n   - Do **not** modify the text content in any way except for adding citations.\n   - Carefully preserve all original whitespace.\n   - Only cite where the source directly supports the claim.\n\n3. **Return Result**\n   - Output the report with added citations, within <exact_text_with_citation> tags.\n\n---\n\n## Citation Guidelines\n\n- **Avoid citing unnecessarily:** Only cite where the claim is directly supported by a source and is not common knowledge.\n- **Cite meaningful semantic units:** Prefer citations at the end of complete thoughts or sentences.\n- **Minimize sentence fragmentation:** Avoid breaking up sentences with multiple citations unless needed for clarity.\n- **No redundant citations close to each other:** Cite only once per sentence per source, even if multiple claims from the same source appear.\n- **Preserve formatting:** Do not alter whitespace or text content aside from adding citations.\n\n---\n\n## Example Usage\n\n```bash\n./processor \"You are an agent for adding correct citations to a research report.

You are given a report within <synthesized_text> tags, which was generated based on the provided sources. However, the sources are not cited in the <synthesized_text>. Your task is to enhance user trust by generating correct, appropriate citations for this report.\n\nBased on the provided document, add citations to the input text using the format specified earlier. Output the resulting report, unchanged except for the added citations, within <exact_text_with_citation> tags.\n\n**Rules:**\n- Do NOT modify the <synthesized_text> in any way - keep all content 100% identical, only add citations\n- Pay careful attention to whitespace: DO NOT add or remove any whitespace\n- ONLY add citations where the source documents directly support claims in the text\n\n**Citation guidelines:**\n- **Avoid citing unnecessarily**: Not every statement needs a citation. Focus on citing key facts, conclusions, and substantive claims that are linked to sources rather than common knowledge. Prioritize citing claims that readers would want to verify, that add credibility to the argument, or where a claim is clearly related to a specific source\n- **Cite meaningful semantic units**: Citations should span complete thoughts, findings, or claims that make sense as standalone assertions. Avoid citing individual words or small phrase fragments that lose meaning out of context; prefer adding citations at the end of sentences\n- **Minimize sentence fragmentation**: Avoid multiple citations within a single sentence that break up the flow of the sentence. Only add citations between phrases within a sentence when it is necessary to attribute specific claims within the sentence to specific sources\n- **No redundant citations close to each other**: Do not place multiple citations to the same source in the same sentence, because this is redundant and unnecessary. If a sentence contains multiple citable claims from the *same* source, use only a single citation at the end of the sentence after the period\", use the following approach:\n\n1. Validate input\n   - Check for presence of <synthesized_text> tags\n   - Verify source documents are provided\n   - Ensure citation format is specified\n\n2. Execute processing\n   - Parse the synthesized text\n   - Analyze source documents\n   - Match content to appropriate sources\n   - Add citations according to guidelines\n   - Maintain exact original text formatting\n\n3. Return result\n   - Output the cited text within <exact_text_with_citation> tags\n   - Ensure no whitespace or content changes\n\n### Example Usage\n\n```bash\n./processor \"You are an agent for adding correct citations to a research report.
