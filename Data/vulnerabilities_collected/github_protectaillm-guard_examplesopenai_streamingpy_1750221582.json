          "response": "Here's a breakdown of what your provided code snippet does, along with a more complete example to demonstrate how to use LLM Guard in a fast, minimally disruptive way with OpenAI and asyncio.\n\n### Explanation\n\n- **Goal:** Integrate LLM Guard into your OpenAI prompt/response pipeline. Prompts and outputs are scanned in real-time. If something looks unsafe or invalid, you halt the process.\n- **Input Scanning:** As you send the prompt to OpenAI, you also check it for dangerous content (prompt injection, toxicity, too long, etc).\n- **Output Scanning:** As you stream the LLM output, you check each chunk for issues (refusal to answer, sensitive content, etc). If a problem is found, you stop streaming immediately.\n\n---\n\n### Example: Fast, Parallel Guard for OpenAI with asyncio\n\nBelow is a more fleshed-out version that demonstrates the pattern. This is not a full, runnable script, but it shows the main logic for integrating LLM Guard into an asyncio-based OpenAI streaming workflow.\n\n```python\nimport asyncio\nimport logging\nimport openai\n\nfrom llm_guard.input_scanners import Anonymize, PromptInjection, TokenLimit, Toxicity\nfrom llm_guard.output_scanners import Deanonymize, NoRefusal, Relevance, Sensitive\nfrom llm_guard.vault import Vault\n\n# Set up logging\nlogging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO)\n\n# Configure your scanners\ninput_scanners = [\n    Anonymize(),\n    PromptInjection(),\n    TokenLimit(max_tokens=2048),\n    Toxicity(),\n]\n\noutput_scanners = [\n    Deanonymize(),\n    NoRefusal(),\n    Relevance(),\n    Sensitive(),\n]\n\n# If you use a Vault for secrets (optional)\nvault = Vault()\n\n# Function to scan the prompt asynchronously\nasync def scan_prompt(prompt):\n    for scanner in input_scanners:\n        is_valid, prompt, error = scanner.scan(prompt)\n        if not is_valid:\n            logging.error(f\"Prompt blocked by {scanner.__class__.__name__}: {error}\")\n            return False, error\n    return True, prompt\n\n# Function to scan output stream chunks\ndef scan_output_chunk(chunk):\n    for scanner in output_scanners:\n        is_valid, chunk, error = scanner.scan(chunk)\n        if not is_valid:\n            logging.error(f\"Output blocked by {scanner.__class__.__name__}: {error}\")\n            return False, error\n    return True, chunk\n\nasync def main():\n    prompt = \"Your LLM prompt here\"\n\n    # 1. Scan prompt in parallel with OpenAI completion request\n    scan_task = asyncio.create_task(scan_prompt(prompt))\n    openai_task = asyncio.create_task(openai.ChatCompletion.acreate(\n        model=\"gpt-3.5-turbo\",\n        messages=[{\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": prompt}],\n        stream=True\n    ))\n\n    # Wait for whichever finishes first\n    done, pending = await asyncio.wait(\n        [scan_task, openai_task],\n        return_when=asyncio.FIRST_COMPLETED\n    )\n\n    if scan_task in done:\n        is_valid, result = scan_task.result()\n        if not is_valid:\n            # Cancel the OpenAI request if prompt is invalid\n            logging.error(f\"Prompt validation failed: {result}\")\n            openai_task.cancel()\n            return\n        # Otherwise, let the OpenAI streaming continue\n\n    # 2. Scan output in streaming mode, stop if output is invalid\n    async for chunk in await openai_task:\n        text_chunk = chunk['choices'][0]['delta'].get('content', '')\n        is_valid, filtered_chunk = scan_output_chunk(text_chunk)\n        if not is_valid:\n            logging.error(\"Output validation failed, stopping stream.\")\n            break\n        print(filtered_chunk, end=\"\", flush=True)\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    asyncio.run(main())\n```\n\n---\n\n### Key Points\n\n- **Prompt and Output Scanning**: Both input and output are guarded, but you don't wait for both to finish before starting the next — maximizing speed.\n- **Disruption minimized**: Only block when a true violation happens.\n- **Streaming Output**: Checks output as it streams, so you can halt at the first sign of trouble.\n\n---\n\n**Note:**  \n- Make sure you have your `OPENAI_API_KEY` set in your environment.\n- Adjust scanners and models as needed for your use case.\n- This example assumes the LLM Guard scanners and the OpenAI API are compatible as shown. Some adaptation may be needed for your actual pipelines.\n\nLet me know if you'd like a version tailored to your exact setup or a more concise example!",

If the prompt is invalid, we stop the completion and log the error.”\n\n• The idea is to quickly validate whether the prompt is allowed. If it’s disallowed (e.g., it contains disallowed content or runs against policy rules), LLM Guard will immediately stop the process.  \n• Parallel scanning ensures you do not block the LLM request for too long. If the content is invalid, you halt before sending anything to OpenAI (saving tokens/cost).\n\n“We scan the output in the streaming mode. We stop the completion as soon as the output is invalid.”\n\n• Once an LLM request is approved, you then stream the output. While data is being streamed, LLM Guard checks partial segments of the LLM’s response. If disallowed content appears in any chunk, LLM Guard stops the streaming and logs the incident.  \n• This approach helps reduce possible policy violations mid-response and immediately halts the stream rather than letting the entire response complete.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n3) Input Scanners: Anonymize, PromptInjection, TokenLimit, Toxicity\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n• Anonymize: Strips out personally identifying information within the prompt (e.g., phone numbers or emails) before sending it to the LLM.  \n• PromptInjection: Checks for malicious or system-level overrides in the prompt. This aims to prevent users from instructing the LLM to override or ignore content policies.  \n• TokenLimit: Ensures the prompt does not exceed a certain token limit (protecting from extremely long or unbounded prompts).  \n• Toxicity: Uses a certain model or heuristic to detect hateful, harassing, or other toxic language in the prompt.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n4) Output Scanners: Deanonymize, NoRefusal, Relevance, Sensitive\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n• Deanonymize: Counterpart to the Anonymize scanner, ensuring anonymized data remains protected and does not leak back into the response.  \n• NoRefusal: Checks if the LLM is refusing or disclaiming content in an undesired manner (for instance, you might want the LLM not to respond with “I can’t do that”), depending on your usage policies.  \n• Relevance: Ensures that the response is on-topic and does not drift into completely unrelated or disallowed territory.  \n• Sensitive: Looks for potentially sensitive content, such as personally identifiable information or regulated data.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n5) Vault\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n• Vault: A secure store for credentials (e.g., API keys) or other secrets required by your environment.  \n• The advantage of using a Vault in conjunction with LLM Guard is that you can keep secrets out of your code and still pass them safely into scanning or requests. This helps you maintain compliance and operational best practices.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nPutting It All Together\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n1. Your code creates an instance of these scanners and configures them (for example, by specifying thresholds for toxicity or providing encryption/decryption keys for anonymization).  \n2. When a user sends a prompt, it is run through the list of input scanners in parallel. If any scanner flags the prompt as invalid (e.g., it’s too long, it contains toxic or disallowed requests), you log an error and do not proceed.  \n3. If the prompt passes inspection, you send it to the LLM via OpenAI’s API.  \n4. You then immediately begin streaming the output back to the user. At the same time, the output scanners check the partial response chunks. If anything suspicious is detected, the streaming is halted, and an error or warning is logged.  \n5. If no violation occurs, the user receives the full output.\n\nThis strategy provides fine-grained control and quick reaction to potential violations while still allowing the user to get immediate responses. It also optimizes for performance by scanning in parallel rather than serially blocking LLM calls.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nAdditional Tips\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n• Make sure to configure logging appropriately to record any scanner flags.  \n• Consider how each input scanner or output scanner aligns with your desired policies. Not every use case requires all scanners.  \n• Proper thresholds (especially for toxicity or relevance) can significantly reduce false positives. You may need to tune them based on your domain or users.  \n• In production environments, you may also want to persist logs for auditing and compliance.  \n\nOverall, this example shows how to integrate LLM Guard into an application with minimal latency overhead and maximum control over potentially problematic content.",

          "response": "This example shows you one quick way to integrate LLM Guard into your OpenAI completion workflow so that you can catch problematic input or output as early as possible and stop the completion if issues are detected. Here’s a breakdown of what’s happening:\n\n1. The idea is to scan the prompt concurrently while the OpenAI completion is in progress. This “parallel” scanning of the prompt helps you detect issues—such as prompt injection attempts, excessive token sizes, potential toxicity, or anything that should be anonymized—before the response is fully generated. If any part of the prompt is found to be invalid, the completion is halted and the error is logged.\n\n2. Similarly, while the output is streaming back from OpenAI, the output is scanned in real time. As soon as the output violates any of the defined safety or relevance criteria (for example, it might include deanonymized sensitive content, a system “refusal”, or be otherwise irrelevent or sensitive), the streaming is stopped immediately. This minimizes exposure to unwanted or harmful content.\n\n3. The code imports a set of scanners from LLM Guard:\n  - Input scanners:  \n    • Anonymize – likely masks or removes sensitive information contained in the prompt.  \n    • PromptInjection – probably detects attempts at malicious prompt injection.  \n    • TokenLimit – ensures that the prompt is within acceptable token bounds.  \n    • Toxicity – checks the prompt for toxic language.\n    \n  - Output scanners:  \n    • Deanonymize – likely reverses any anonymization needed in a safe way if required.  \n    • NoRefusal – may ensure that the model is not generating a refusal message or similar undesired style.  \n    • Relevance – ensures that the output meets certain relevance criteria with respect to the request.  \n    • Sensitive – evaluates whether the output contains sensitive information that should trigger a halt.\n\n4. The Vault import from llm_guard.vault is there to potentially manage secure keys or configurations. In a real-world implementation, you would likely use a Vault to handle your API keys or any sensitive configuration parameters needed by LLM Guard or OpenAI.\n\n5. Installation instructions are provided in the comments to install the package from its GitHub repository as well as OpenAI and asyncio, indicating that the implementation is asynchronous. This asynchronous design is crucial because it lets you run the prompt scan and output streaming concurrently, which minimizes disruption when scanning for issues.\n\nIn summary, the code snippet demonstrates a protective layer for LLM completions where:\n- The incoming prompt is scanned for various issues concurrently while the completion is being requested.\n- The resulting output is also scanned in real time.\n- Any issues detected on either side (input or output) will result in an immediate halt of the process, making the integration both fast and minimally disruptive.\n\nIf you plan to implement this example, make sure to review each scanner’s API and adhere to their configuration requirements, so they behave as expected for the type of content or risks you want to guard against.",

It looks like you are interested in how to use [LLM Guard](https://github.com/protectai/llm-guard) to scan both prompts and completions with OpenAI, in streaming mode, and to handle errors or invalid outputs by stopping as soon as an issue is detected.\n\nBelow is a cleaned-up, commented example that demonstrates:\n\n- How to scan the prompt in parallel with the OpenAI call.\n- How to stream the output and scan each chunk.\n- How to immediately stop and log an error if any scan fails.\n\n**Prerequisites:**\n```bash\npip install openai\npip install git+https://github.com/protectai/llm-guard.git\n```\n\n**Example Code:**\n\n```python\nimport asyncio\nimport openai\nfrom llm_guard.vault import Vault\nfrom llm_guard.input_scanners import Sensitive, Relevance, NoRefusal, Deanonymize\nfrom llm_guard.output_scanners import Toxicity, TokenLimit, PromptInjection, Anonymize\n\n# Initialize Vault and scanners\nvault = Vault()\ninput_scanners = [\n    Sensitive(),\n    Relevance(),\n    NoRefusal(),\n    Deanonymize()\n]\noutput_scanners = [\n    Toxicity(),\n    TokenLimit(),\n    PromptInjection(),\n    Anonymize()\n]\n\nasync def scan_prompt(prompt):\n    for scanner in input_scanners:\n        is_valid, result = scanner.scan(prompt)\n        if not is_valid:\n            print(f\"Prompt invalid: {result}\")\n            return False\n    return True\n\nasync def stream_and_scan_completion(prompt):\n    # OpenAI streaming completion\n    stream = await openai.ChatCompletion.acreate(\n        model=\"gpt-3.5-turbo\",\n        messages=[{\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": prompt}],\n        stream=True\n    )\n    async for chunk in stream:\n        text = chunk['choices'][0].get('delta', {}).get('content', '')\n        if not text:\n            continue  # No content in this chunk\n        for scanner in output_scanners:\n            is_valid, result = scanner.scan(text)\n            if not is_valid:\n                print(f\"Output invalid: {result}\")\n                return  # Stop streaming on invalid output\n        print(text, end='', flush=True)  # Output valid chunk\n\nasync def main():\n    prompt = \"Your prompt here\"\n    # 1.

(This is only one possible approach; your actual use may differ depending on your integration and policies.) In this example:\n\n1. We first scan the prompt asynchronously.\n2. As soon as the OpenAI streaming completion begins, we scan each streaming output chunk.\n3. If a scan fails (for example, because the prompt or a chunk contains disallowed content), the guard “fires”: we log the error and stop further streaming.\n\nNote that the code below makes several assumptions about available scanning functions (such as those from modules for Sensitive data, NoRefusal, Deanonymize, Toxicity, etc.) and builds a simplified demonstration of concurrent scanning using Python’s asyncio.\n\n────────────────────────────\nExample Code:\n\nimport asyncio\nimport openai\n\n# Import hypothetical modules from llm_guard installed via:\n# pip install git+https://github.com/protectai/llm-guard.git\n#\n# For example, assume our guard’s vault contains policies for the prompt:\nfrom llm_guard.vault import Sensitive, Relevance, NoRefusal, Deanonymize\n# And the output scanners contain checks on toxicity, token limits, malicious injections:\nfrom llm_guard.output_scanners import Toxicity, TokenLimit, PromptInjection, Anonymize\n# And we have an input scanner for logging purposes:\nfrom llm_guard.input_scanners import LoggingScanner\n\n# ----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n# Helper function: scan the prompt in parallel.

If the prompt contains forbidden content, it immediately raises an exception.\n  \n• When starting the OpenAI streaming completion call, we use an async for‐loop to process each chunk. For every chunk received, scan_output_chunk() is called. If any chunk fails the scan (for example, because it contains disallowed text such as “explicit”), an exception is raised and caught in the stream_and_guard() function.\n  \n• In the except clauses, we log the error (here simply with a print statement) and stop further processing.\n\n• The use of asyncio ensures that the prompt and each output chunk are scanned concurrently for the fastest and least disruptive protection.\n\nRemember to configure your OpenAI API key and adjust the engine/model as needed, and note that actual scanning functions provided by llm-guard may have different method names or parameters compared to this simplified example.\n\nThis demonstration should help you understand one possible workflow for integrating Guard LLM mechanisms into your OpenAI deployments.",

Let’s break down the example you provided and answer your question.\n\n### What This Code Does (Summary):\n\nThis example shows how to add **LLM Guard** as a security middleware for prompting and output when using a Large Language Model (like OpenAI's GPT-3/4). The goal is to **minimize risk** with **minimal disruption** to existing workflows.\n\n#### Workflow Steps:\n\n1. **Input/Prompt Scanning (in parallel):**\n   - Before (or during) sending the prompt to OpenAI, LLM Guard scans the prompt for issues like:\n     - Prompt injection attempts\n     - Token length limits\n     - Toxic language\n     - Sensitive information (with Anonymization)\n   - If a problem is detected, the request is stopped and logged.\n\n2. **Output Scanning (during streaming):**\n   - As the OpenAI model streams the response, LLM Guard inspects the output in real-time for:\n     - De-anonymization (leaking masked data)\n     - Refusal to answer (e.g., \"I'm sorry, I can't help with that.\")\n     - Irrelevant content\n     - Sensitive data leakage\n   - If something bad is found, streaming is stopped and the event is logged.\n\n#### Code Snippet Functions:\n\n- `llm_guard.input_scanners` and `llm_guard.output_scanners` — These are modules with classes for specific security checks.\n- `Vault` — Used for securely storing secrets or sensitive data, and for anonymization/deanonymization.\n\n#### Security Benefits:\n\n- **Prevents prompt injection and data leakage:** By checking both input and output.\n- **Stops issues early:** Invalid inputs/outputs are stopped and not sent to or from the LLM.\n- **Non-disruptive:** Can be integrated in a way that doesn't require major changes to your existing code.\n- **Streaming support:** Output is monitored in real-time, minimizing the risk window.\n\n---\n\n## Why This Is Useful for Security Assessment\n\n- **Demonstrates defense in depth:** You are not trusting the LLM blindly—you check both what you send and what you receive.\n- **Prevents known attacks:** Prompt injection, data leakage, output refusal, toxicity, etc.\n- **Logs issues for auditing:** Events are logged, supporting incident response and compliance.\n\n---\n\n## In Summary\n\n- **LLM Guard** acts as a security layer around your LLM usage.\n- **Parallel scanning** and **streaming checks** minimize latency and disruption.\n- **Covers both input and output risks** (prompt injection, sensitive data, toxic content, etc.).\n- **Easy to integrate** with existing OpenAI-based workflows.\n\n**If you need a more detailed code walkthrough, or want to see how to wire this up with OpenAI and asyncio, let me know!**",

          "response": "Below is a brief walkthrough of how the code snippet works, what each imported scanner does, and how LLM Guard can fit into an application’s flow. It’s based on the example you shared, where the goal is to intercept both the prompt and the output (in parallel and streaming mode, respectively), and halt further processing if any “invalid” content is found.\n\n───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n1. Installation & Imports\n───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n\n• pip install llm_guard@git+https://github.com/protectai/llm-guard.git  \n• pip install openai asyncio  \n\nThen you import:\n• Anonymize, PromptInjection, TokenLimit, Toxicity from llm_guard.input_scanners\n• Deanonymize, NoRefusal, Relevance, Sensitive from llm_guard.output_scanners\n• Vault from llm_guard.vault  \n\nThese scanners and the vault are core components of LLM Guard.\n\n───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n2. Conceptual Flow: Prompt Scanning & Output Scanning\n───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n\na) Prompt Scanning in Parallel\n   • Before or while you send your prompt to the OpenAI (or any LLM) API, you pass it through one or more “input scanners.”\n   • If any scanner flags the prompt as invalid (e.g., it detects injection or toxicity), you immediately stop sending it to the LLM (or stop processing if you’re already sending in parallel).\n   • This avoids sending problematic or malicious prompts to the model and is useful for scenarios like guardrails or compliance checks.\n\nb) Output Scanning in Streaming Mode\n   • As tokens are streamed back from the LLM, you run them through the “output scanners” in real time.\n   • If any output scanner flags the response as inappropriate (e.g., it reveals sensitive info or fails relevance criteria), you immediately stop the streaming and discard the partial or complete response as needed.\n   • This mechanism helps ensure that if a model veers off into disallowed or risky content midway through its response, you catch it before the entire response is revealed.\n\n───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n3. What the Scanners Do\n───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n\nBelow are brief explanations of the example scanners you imported:\n\nINPUT SCANNERS:\n1) Anonymize: \n   • This typically removes personally identifying information (PII) from the prompt.  \n   • If you’re feeding user-generated content into your model, anonymization can protect privacy by obfuscating names, emails, phone numbers, etc.\n\n2) PromptInjection:  \n   • Detects attempts by a user to override or manipulate system messages or instructions.  \n   • This is designed to guard against “system prompt injection,” where an adversarial user tries to feed special phrases that override moderation rules or developer instructions.\n\n3) TokenLimit:  \n   • Ensures the prompt stays within a specified token (or character) budget before the model is invoked.  \n   • If the user’s prompt is too long, you can choose to truncate or reject it.\n\n4) Toxicity:  \n   • A scanner that checks the text for hateful or harassing language, violent threats, or other toxic content.  \n   • If found, you might block it outright or handle it differently depending on your rules.\n\nOUTPUT SCANNERS:\n1) Deanonymize:  \n   • This can attempt to re-inject anonymized data or check if the output tries to reveal PI (personally identifiable) data that was removed in the input scanning phase.  \n   • Typically used in a workflow where you’d like to keep some user data hidden while a model processes it, then selectively restore relevant parts if they’re allowed or needed.\n\n2) NoRefusal:  \n   • Detects if the LLM “refuses” to answer when it actually should. This can be used in contexts where you want to require an answer, as long as it’s within policy.  \n   • It’s somewhat less common and depends on your business rules about whether a refusal is allowed or not.\n\n3) Relevance:  \n   • Checks if the response stays on topic (i.e., relevant to the user’s prompt or conversation context).  \n   • Helps to ensure the model doesn’t wander off into irrelevancies or unrequested content.\n\n4) Sensitive:  \n   • Flags if the response contains disallowed or highly sensitive content.  \n   • You can configure your own definitions of “sensitive” content—whether that’s personal info, copyrighted text, or something else.\n\n───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n4. The Vault\n───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n\nThe Vault component from llm_guard.vault is generally used to securely store credentials or other sensitive data that the scanners may need access to. For example, if your scanners connect to external services (like a specialized toxicity detection API) or require encryption keys to properly handle anonymization, you can store and retrieve them using Vault.\n\n───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n5. Minimal Usage Example (High-Level Pseudocode)\n───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n\nBelow is a generic, simplified example of how you might structure your code using these scanners in practice. This is not a drop-in script but should illustrate how to integrate scanning in parallel with token streaming from an LLM:\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nimport openai\nimport asyncio\nfrom llm_guard import LLMGuard\nfrom llm_guard.input_scanners import PromptInjection, Toxicity\nfrom llm_guard.output_scanners import Sensitive\n\n# 1. Instantiate LLMGuard (optionally configure it)\nguard = LLMGuard(\n    input_scanners=[PromptInjection(), Toxicity()],\n    output_scanners=[Sensitive()],\n    # Possibly more configuration for logging, parallel scanning, etc.\n)\n\nasync def guarded_completion(prompt: str) -> str:\n    # 2. Check prompt with input scanners (in parallel or sequentially)\n    if not guard.check_input(prompt):\n        raise ValueError(\"Prompt failed security checks.\")\n\n    # 3. Start the streaming call\n    response_text = \"\"\n    async for token in openai.ChatCompletion.acreate(\n        model=\"gpt-3.5-turbo\",\n        messages=[{\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": prompt}],\n        stream=True\n    ):\n        # 4. For each token chunk, scan with output scanners\n        chunk_text = token[\"choices\"][0][\"delta\"].get(\"content\", \"\")\n        if chunk_text:\n            if not guard.check_output_in_stream(chunk_text):\n                # If scanner flags it, stop the stream\n                raise ValueError(\"Content flagged by output scanner.\")\n            response_text += chunk_text\n\n    return response_text\n\n# 5. Run the function\nasync def main():\n    user_prompt = \"Tell me something interesting about data security.\"\n    try:\n        answer = await guarded_completion(user_prompt)\n        print(\"Final answer:\", answer)\n    except ValueError as e:\n        print(f\"Completion rejected: {e}\")\n\n# In your actual code, run: asyncio.run(main())\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nNotes:\n• guard.check_input(...) will run your Input Scanner checks. If they fail, it returns False (or raises an exception, depending on your config).  \n• guard.check_output_in_stream(...) is one way of scanning tokens as they arrive; if something is flagged, you stop reading further tokens and halt.\n\n───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n6. Logging & Error Handling\n───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n\n• Since you mentioned logging, you can configure Python’s logging library to capture both successful completions and errors. You could log the occurrence and reason whenever a scanner flags content.  \n• For questionable content, you may choose different behaviors: sanitize the text, substitute placeholders, or store a partial transcript for auditing, etc.\n\n───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n7. Practical Considerations\n───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n\n• Performance: Scanning in parallel or streaming mode adds overhead, so test carefully. The advantage is that you prevent questionable content from going out or in.  \n• Customization: Many scanners allow threshold tuning or custom checks. You can develop your own modules for domain-specific checks (e.g., scanning for PII in a healthcare context).  \n• Privacy: If you’re anonymizing user inputs, ensure you handle them consistently in the output scanning phase (e.g., re-check for unexpected re-identification).\n\n───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nSummary\n───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nLLM Guard’s scanners provide a modular way to intercept unwanted content in both prompts and outputs with minimal disruption. By configuring the scanning rules—whether for toxicity, data leakage, or policy alignment—you can halt interactions whenever a violation occurs. This is especially useful in production scenarios, compliance frameworks, or high-trust environments where you must prevent not only malicious prompts but also ensure the model never exposes sensitive or disallowed information in its answers.\n\nI hope this overview clarifies how to integrate LLM Guard into your application, how each scanner functions, and how parallel/streaming scanning is typically performed. Feel free to follow up with any additional questions regarding setup, customization, or performance considerations.",

Purpose of LLM Guard:\n • The code is part of a security assessment setup that integrates LLM Guard—a framework designed to protect large language model (LLM) interactions from various risks such as prompt injection, toxic content, or unintended data leaks.\n • The idea is to run safety checks on both the input (the prompt) and output (the generated completion) in real time, so vulnerabilities or issues can be caught early and the process halted if needed.\n\n2. Input Safety Scanners:\n • The snippet shows that before the actual LLM (e.g., OpenAI's completion model) generates output, the prompt is scanned using several modules:\n  – Anonymize: Likely ensures that personally identifiable or sensitive information in the prompt is either masked or removed.\n  – PromptInjection: Checks the prompt for attempts to bypass safety measures or instruct the model to produce undesired output.\n  – TokenLimit: Ensures that the prompt does not exceed any preset token constraints that might risk model performance or trigger abuse.\n  – Toxicity: Examines the prompt for toxic or harmful language.\n • If any of these checks fail, the processing stops immediately and an error is logged instead of sending the prompt to the LLM.\n\n3. Output Safety Scanners:\n • Similarly, the system monitors the output as it is streamed from the LLM. This is done using modules for scanning the output:\n  – Deanonymize: Potentially checks if any anonymized information is being (re)exposed in the output.\n  – NoRefusal: Ensures the generated output isn’t an overly generic or “refusal” message that might not serve the user’s intent.\n  – Relevance: Verifies that the completion remains on topic and pertinent to the original request.\n  – Sensitive: Detects if the generated content contains any sensitive or inappropriate material.\n • The verification happens on-the-fly (“in the streaming mode”), halting the generation as soon as something is flagged.\n\n4. Implementation Notes:\n • The code lists installation commands suggesting that llm_guard is pip-installable directly from its GitHub repository.\n • The libraries openai and asyncio are mentioned, indicating that the asynchronous streaming of completions is used to allow real-time scanning.\n • Importing from llm_guard.vault implies there might be a secure mechanism for handling secrets or API keys, ensuring sensitive information is properly managed.\n\n5. Overall Workflow:\n • The system initiates an LLM completion while concurrently scanning the prompt.\n • If the prompt passes all checks, the LLM generates text.\n • As text is generated, output scanners simultaneously check the content.\n • The process is designed to be both fast and minimally intrusive, allowing usage of LLMs with a higher level of trust by preventing harmful or insecure content from being processed or produced.\n\nThis setup demonstrates how security layers can be integrated with LLMs, making it useful for research purposes when you want to ensure safe, controlled interactions with generative models.",

          "response": "Below is an explanation of what the example is doing and some recommendations for cleaning up the code. The example demonstrates how to integrate LLM Guard with an OpenAI completion call in order to both pre‑validate the prompt and continuously monitor the generated output for issues. Here’s a breakdown of the approach and code:\n\n─────────────────────────────  \nOverview\n\n1. Parallel Input Scanning:  \n • The idea is to inspect the prompt (or input) at the same time as requesting a completion from OpenAI.  \n • Various scanners (for example, those that look for prompt injections, potential toxicity, token limits, etc.) are applied.  \n • If the input is found to be problematic, the system stops the generation (or “completion”) and logs an error.\n\n2. Streaming Output Scanning:  \n • As the completion output is streamed back, another set of scanners checks the output for issues (such as deanonymization problems, refusal triggers, or relevance concerns).  \n • If the output becomes invalid at any point, the system immediately terminates the output stream.\n\n─────────────────────────────  \nModules and Components\n\n- Input Scanners (from llm_guard.input_scanners):  \n • Anonymize – likely designed to mask or remove sensitive data in the input.  \n • PromptInjection – used to detect if there’s an injection attempt within the prompt.  \n • TokenLimit – to ensure the prompt does not exceed a certain number of tokens.  \n • Toxicity – to check whether the prompt contains toxic or harmful content.\n\n- Output Scanners (from llm_guard.output_scanners):  \n • Deanonymize – which might reverse the anonymization applied earlier or verify that sensitive information isn’t revealed.  \n • NRoefusal – a module that could handle refusal or safe completion triggers.  \n • Relevance – ensuring the generated output stays relevant to the prompt.  \n • Sensitive – checking the output for sensitive content.\n\n- Vault (from llm_guard.vault):  \n • Likely used to securely manage API keys, tokens, or other sensitive credentials needed to use the OpenAI API or manage internal state.\n\n─────────────────────────────  \nInstallation\n\nThe code snippet suggests installing the required libraries using pip. For example:\n\n pip install llm_guard@git+https://github.com/protectai/llm-guard.git  \n pip install openai asyncio\n\nThis ensures that you have both the LLM Guard package and any dependency (like the OpenAI client library and asyncio for asynchronous streaming) installed.\n\n─────────────────────────────  \nImproving the Code Example\n\nBelow is a corrected and better-formatted version of the example code. Note that this version assumes that you have a working setup with proper implementations for each scanner:\n\n-------------------------------------------------\n#!/usr/bin/env python3\nimport logging\nimport asyncio\nimport openai\n\n# Import input scanners\nfrom llm_guard.input_scanners import Anonymize, PromptInjection, TokenLimit, Toxicity\n\n# Import output scanners\nfrom llm_guard.output_scanners import Deanonymize, NRoefusal, Relevance, Sensitive\n\n# Import the Vault for secure credentials handling\nfrom llm_guard.vault import Vault\n\n# Optionally set up logging\nlogging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO)\n\nasync def generate_completion(prompt: str):\n    # Perform parallel prompt scanning\n    if not (PromptInjection.validate(prompt) and TokenLimit.check(prompt) and Toxicity.assess(prompt)):\n        logging.error(\"Prompt validation failed. Stopping completion.\")\n        return\n\n    # Anonymize the prompt if needed\n    safe_prompt = Anonymize.mask(prompt)\n\n    # Example: initiate streaming completion from OpenAI (pseudocode)\n    try:\n        # Start the OpenAI completion as an async operation\n        async for chunk in openai.ChatCompletion.acreate(\n            model=\"gpt-4\",\n            messages=[{\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": safe_prompt}],\n            stream=True\n        ):\n            # Each 'chunk' is scanned in real-time\n            if not (Deanonymize.validate(chunk) and NRoefusal.check(chunk) and \n                    Relevance.assess(chunk) and Sensitive.monitor(chunk)):\n                logging.error(\"Output validation failed. Terminating completion stream.\")\n                # Implement any stream termination logic here\n                break\n            # Otherwise, process or display the valid chunk\n            print(chunk.get(\"content\", \"\"), end=\"\")\n    except Exception as e:\n        logging.exception(\"An error occurred during completion: %s\", e)\n\ndef main():\n    # Example prompt; in practice, this could come from any source.\n    prompt = \"Provide an example of secure coding practices in Python.\"\n    asyncio.run(generate_completion(prompt))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n─────────────────────────────  \nExplanation of the Corrected Code\n\n• The script sets up logging and imports necessary packages.  \n• The asynchronous function generate_completion() first validates the prompt using the input scanners.  \n• If the prompt passes validation, it proceeds to anonymize (mask) it and then sends it for an OpenAI streaming completion.  \n• The output from OpenAI is processed chunk by chunk; each chunk is immediately validated using the output scanners.  \n• If any chunk fails validation, the process logs an error and stops processing further output.  \n• Finally, the main() function demonstrates how to call the async function.\n\n─────────────────────────────  \nConclusion\n\nThis example shows how LLM Guard can be integrated into your application to ensure both input and output quality and safety. It does so in a manner that minimizes delays in streaming completions while preventing harmful or invalid content from being processed or displayed.",

Defining Output Scanners:  \n   These scanners evaluate tokens as they stream back from the model. If an output scanner identifies content that fails your policy (e.g., PII exposure or hateful language), it immediately stops streaming further tokens.\n\n4. Prompt and Output Flow:  \n   The prompt is scanned in parallel with sending the completion request to OpenAI; if the prompt is invalid, LLM Guard raises an exception and no tokens are ever generated. For valid prompts, LLM Guard streams back tokens one by one and checks them on the fly, immediately halting if anything is flagged.\n\n5. “Fastest and Least Disruptive” Flow:  \n   • Parallel prompt scanning → You avoid waiting for the model to generate invalid content.  \n   • Streaming output scanning → You catch invalid tokens early, rather than after the entire response.  \n\nThis setup will help ensure you are rejecting disallowed prompts quickly and stopping outputs at the earliest sign of policy violations—meeting the goal of minimal latency and maximum control.",

          "response": "This example shows how to integrate LLM Guard into your application to protect both the incoming prompt and the LLM’s streaming output. The overall idea is to run a set of safety checks concurrently with the OpenAI completion so that if any problem is detected (for instance, if the prompt is crafted to inject malicious instructions or if the output contains disallowed content), the request can be interrupted immediately.\n\nBelow is an explanation of what each part does:\n\n1. Overview of the Process:\n   • The input prompt is scanned concurrently with the LLM's completion request. This \"parallel\" scanning helps ensure that if there is any issue with the prompt (e.g., it exceeds a token limit, attempts prompt injection, contains toxic language, etc.), the completion can be stopped before too much processing happens.\n   • As the LLM outputs its stream of text, the output is scanned in real time. If the scanning detects that the output is invalid (such as including sensitive material or deviating from acceptable content guidelines), the streaming output is halted immediately.\n\n2. Installation and Dependencies:\n   • The commented pip install commands indicate that you need to install the LLM Guard package from its GitHub repository and also install the OpenAI and asyncio packages. These packages provide the necessary functionality for interacting with the LLM and handling asynchronous processes.\n   \n     For example:\n     pip install llm_guard@git+https://github.com/protectai/llm-guard.git\n     pip install openai asyncio\n\n3. Importing Components:\n   • The code imports different scanners for both the input and the output:\n     \n     • Input scanners:\n       - Anonymize: Likely used to remove or mask personal or sensitive data in the prompt.\n       - PromptInjection: Checks if the input prompt might include instructions aimed at manipulating the system (a type of prompt hacking).\n       - TokenLimit: Ensures that the prompt does not exceed a specified maximum number of tokens.\n       - Toxicity: Scans for any toxic or harmful language in the incoming prompt.\n     \n     • Output scanners:\n       - Deanonymize: Possibly used to restore or appropriately handle any data that was anonymized in the prompt, ensuring consistency or clarity in the output.\n       - NoRefusal: Ensures that the LLM does not refuse to provide an answer when it might be expected to.\n       - Relevance: Checks that the output is consistent with the subject matter of the prompt.\n       - Sensitive: Detects any sensitive content that should result in stopping the output.\n     \n   • Additionally, Vault is imported from llm_guard.vault. This might be used for secure storage of configurations, keys, or policies that the guard uses.\n\n4. How It Works in Practice:\n   • When a request is made to the LLM, the prompt is first examined using the input scanners. If there’s a problem (say, if the prompt is too long, contains potential injection attempts, or exhibits toxicity), the operation stops immediately and the error is logged.\n   • Once the prompt passes these checks, the LLM begins generating output. Simultaneously, as text is streamed back, the output scanners ensure that every piece of the generated content is checked for issues like sensitive or off-topic information. If any violation is detected during streaming, the process is halted right away to prevent the delivery of disallowed content.\n\nThis architecture is designed to ensure fast and efficient checking while minimizing disruption—meaning that in most cases, if everything is valid, the response goes through with minimal latency. However, if there’s any concern about the safety or integrity of the input or generated text, the system can intervene quickly.\n\nIn summary, this snippet and its design illustrate a robust safety guard layer for applications working with large language models, balancing responsiveness with rigorous content checks for both user inputs and AI outputs.",

The main goals are:\n\n1. To scan the prompt for potential issues before or while sending it to the language model.\n2. To scan the output in real-time (streaming mode) to catch any problematic content as soon as it's generated.\n\nHere's a breakdown of the components:\n\n1. Input Scanners:\n   - Anonymize: Replaces sensitive information in the prompt with placeholders.\n   - PromptInjection: Detects attempts to manipulate the model's behavior.\n   - TokenLimit: Ensures the prompt doesn't exceed a specified token limit.\n   - Toxicity: Checks for toxic or inappropriate content in the prompt.\n\n2. Output Scanners:\n   - Deanonymize: Replaces placeholders with the original sensitive information.\n   - NoRefusal: Detects if the model is refusing to answer a valid question.\n   - Relevance: Ensures the output is relevant to the input prompt.\n   - Sensitive: Checks for sensitive information in the output.\n\n3. Vault: A secure storage for sensitive information during the anonymization process.\n\nThe code aims to:\n- Run prompt scanning in parallel with the API call to minimize latency.\n- Stop the completion process immediately if the prompt is found to be invalid.\n- Scan the output in streaming mode, allowing for real-time intervention if issues are detected.\n\nThis approach provides a balance between security and performance, ensuring that both inputs and outputs are checked for potential issues without significantly impacting the response time of the language model.",

If the input is found invalid (e.g., prompt injection, toxicity, token limits), you stop the LLM completion and log the error.\n\n2. **Output Scanning (Streaming)**:  \n   As the LLM returns output (possibly in streaming mode), you scan each chunk. If something invalid (e.g., sensitive info, toxicity, refusal, irrelevance) is detected, you immediately halt the process.\n\n## Installation\n\n```python\n# Install LLM Guard from GitHub and install dependencies\n# pip install llm_guard@git+https://github.com/protectai/llm-guard.git\n# pip install openai asyncio\n```\n\n## Library Imports\n\n```python\nimport logging\nfrom llm_guard.input_scanners import Anonymize, PromptInjection, TokenLimit, Toxicity\nfrom llm_guard.output_scanners import Deanonymize, NoRefusal, Relevance, Sensitive\nfrom llm_guard.vault import Vault\n```\n\n## What These Imports Do\n\n- **Input Scanners**:  \n  - `Anonymize`: Removes PII from input.\n  - `PromptInjection`: Detects prompt injection attempts.\n  - `TokenLimit`: Ensures input doesn't exceed token limits.\n  - `Toxicity`: Scans for toxic content in user input.\n\n- **Output Scanners**:  \n  - `Deanonymize`: Detects if output leaks PII.\n  - `NoRefusal`: Checks if the LLM is refusing to answer.\n  - `Relevance`: Ensures output is relevant to the prompt.\n  - `Sensitive`: Detects sensitive information in output.\n\n- **Vault**:  \n  Manages secrets and sensitive data for anonymization/deanonymization.\n\n---\n\n## Example Structure\n\nHere’s a skeleton of how you might put this together:\n\n```python\nimport asyncio\nimport openai\nimport logging\nfrom llm_guard.input_scanners import Anonymize, PromptInjection, TokenLimit, Toxicity\nfrom llm_guard.output_scanners import Deanonymize, NoRefusal, Relevance, Sensitive\nfrom llm_guard.vault import Vault\n\n# Set up logging\nlogging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO)\n\n# Initialize Vault and scanners\nvault = Vault()\ninput_scanners = [\n    Anonymize(vault),\n    PromptInjection(),\n    TokenLimit(limit=2048),\n    Toxicity()\n]\noutput_scanners = [\n    Deanonymize(vault),\n    NoRefusal(),\n    Relevance(),\n    Sensitive()\n]\n\nasync def scan_input(prompt):\n    for scanner in input_scanners:\n        is_valid, info = scanner.scan(prompt)\n        if not is_valid:\n            logging.error(f\"Input scan failed: {info}\")\n            return False\n    return True\n\nasync def scan_output(output_chunk):\n    for scanner in output_scanners:\n        is_valid, info = scanner.scan(output_chunk)\n        if not is_valid:\n            logging.error(f\"Output scan failed: {info}\")\n            return False\n    return True\n\nasync def main(prompt):\n    # Scan input in parallel\n    input_valid_task = asyncio.create_task(scan_input(prompt))\n    # Start OpenAI completion (simulate streaming)\n    async for chunk in openai.ChatCompletion.acreate(\n        model=\"gpt-3.5-turbo\",\n        messages=[{\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": prompt}],\n        stream=True\n    ):\n        output = chunk['choices'][0]['delta'].get('content', '')\n        if not await scan_output(output):\n            logging.error(\"Aborting streaming due to invalid output.\")\n            break\n\n    if not await input_valid_task:\n        logging.error(\"Input was invalid.

If any scanner fails, it raises an exception which you can handle or log.  \n  - Output scanners run on each text chunk in streaming mode to verify the response. If any scanner fails midstream, we immediately stop receiving further text.\n\n• Prompt Validation Step:\n  - vault.validate_input(prompt) checks the prompt for issues (token-length, forbidden patterns, toxicity, etc.). If the prompt is invalid, you stop right away.\n\n• Streaming + Output Validation:\n  - By setting stream=True on the OpenAI call, you receive chunks of the model’s response.  \n  - You pass each chunk into vault.validate_output(text_chunk). If that chunk is invalid, raise an exception and stop the stream. Otherwise, continue.\n\n• Fast + Least Disruptive:\n  - The overhead is minimal: LLM Guard’s validations are performed on each chunk of data. As soon as an issue arises, we stop. Otherwise, everything proceeds like a normal OpenAI streaming response.\n\nFeel free to adapt or remove specific scanners to match your use case. You can add custom scanners by subclassing InputScanner or OutputScanner and implementing your own validation methods.",

          "response": "This example demonstrates one way to integrate LLM Guard with your OpenAI completion flow so that both the prompt and the streaming output are monitored in real time. Here’s a breakdown of what’s happening:\n\n1. Installing the Packages\n • The lines starting with “# pip install” show that you should install LLM Guard (from its GitHub repository) and the OpenAI package. This makes the necessary modules available for your project.\n\n2. Importing the Modules\n • The code imports logging and asyncio, which are useful for asynchronous execution and logging errors.\n • From llm_guard.input_scanners, it imports several classes:\n  – Anonymize: Likely used to remove or mask sensitive information from the input prompt.\n  – PromptInjection: Checks that the prompt isn’t attempting to manipulate the system (i.e., prevent prompt injection attacks).\n  – TokenLimit: Ensures that the prompt does not exceed a certain number of tokens.\n  – Toxicity: Scans for toxic or otherwise harmful content contained in the input.\n • From llm_guard.output_scanners, it imports:\n  – Deanonymize: Potentially restores any anonymized content in the output if needed (subject to your policy).\n  – NoRefusal: Makes sure that the output isn’t a simple refusal message.\n  – Relevance: Verifies that the output stays on topic.\n  – Sensitive: Checks for sensitive content in the generated output.\n • From llm_guard.vault, it imports Vault, which might be used for securely handling API keys, secrets, or other sensitive configuration settings.\n\n3. How the Guard Works\n • The idea is to scan your input prompt and the corresponding output in parallel:\n  – As soon as the prompt is provided, it is scanned for issues such as injections, excessive length (via token limits), or toxic content. If any part of the prompt is flagged, the process stops, and an error is logged.\n  – Similarly, once you start receiving the streamed output from the OpenAI completion API, it is continuously monitored. At the first sign that the output violates any guidelines (e.g., irrelevant or sensitive content), the system halts further output.\n • This “fast and least disruptive” method is beneficial when working with generators that provide streaming responses, as it prevents unnecessary processing and quickly cuts off potentially harmful or unwanted content.\n\n4. What to Do Next\n • In your application, after setting up these imports and installing the packages, the next step would be to initialize the scanners and integrate them into your asynchronous code handling the OpenAI completions.\n • For example, you might create a function that first scans the prompt with all the input scanners. Then, if all checks pass, you call the streaming API and start checking the output as it comes in with the output scanners.\n • The Vault would be used to manage and securely fetch any secrets (like API keys), ensuring that sensitive information remains protected.\n\nThis pattern allows you to ensure security and quality of both inputs and outputs in real time with minimal disruption to the streaming process. If you need further details on how to initialize and run these scanners in your code or have more questions about integrating this into a complete application scenario, feel free to ask!",

Here is an academic-style security assessment of the provided LLM Guard usage scenario, with a focus on its effectiveness, potential risks, and suggestions for improvement.\n\n---\n\n## Security Assessment: Fast and Non-Disruptive LLM Guard Integration\n\n### Overview\n\nThis assessment evaluates a deployment approach for LLM Guard—a security library for Large Language Models (LLMs)—designed to minimize latency and workflow disruption while enforcing input and output scanning for security and compliance.\n\n#### Workflow Summary\n\n- **Prompt Scanning:** The user prompt is scanned in parallel with sending it to the OpenAI API. If any scanner flags the prompt as invalid, the completion is stopped and the incident is logged.\n- **Streaming Output Scanning:** The model's output is streamed and scanned in real time. Completion is interrupted immediately upon detection of invalid content.\n\n#### Key Components Used\n\n- **Input Scanners:**  \n  - `Anonymize`: Removes personally identifiable information (PII).\n  - `PromptInjection`: Detects adversarial prompt manipulations.\n  - `TokenLimit`: Enforces token count restrictions.\n  - `Toxicity`: Identifies toxic or harmful language.\n- **Output Scanners:**  \n  - `Deanonymize`: Prevents re-identification of anonymized entities.\n  - `NoRefusal`: Detects model refusals.\n  - `Relevance`: Ensures output relevance to the input.\n  - `Sensitive`: Screens for sensitive or restricted content.\n- **Vault:**  \n  - Securely manages secrets and policies.\n\n---\n\n### Security Assessment\n\n#### Strengths\n\n1. **Early Detection and Response:**  \n   By scanning inputs and outputs in real time, the system halts processing at the first sign of policy violation, reducing the risk of data leakage or toxic outputs.\n\n2. **Parallel Processing:**  \n   Scanning the prompt in parallel with the API call minimizes added latency, supporting low-disruption integration.\n\n3. **Comprehensive Coverage:**  \n   Multiple scanners address a broad set of threats, including PII leakage, prompt injection, and toxic content.\n\n4. **Logging:**  \n   Logging invalid prompts and completions provides an audit trail for monitoring and incident response.\n\n#### Limitations and Risks\n\n1. **Race Condition Risk:**  \n   Parallel prompt scanning may allow a prompt to reach the LLM before a scanner flags it as invalid, leading to unwanted completions.\n\n2. **Partial Output Exposure:**  \n   In streaming mode, there is a risk that harmful content may be streamed to the user before detection and interruption.\n\n3. **Scanner Efficacy:**  \n   The effectiveness depends on the accuracy of the scanners (false positives/negatives may impact user experience or security).\n\n4. **Disruption Handling:**  \n   Abrupt completion termination may result in incomplete outputs, potentially confusing end-users or downstream systems.\n\n5. **Logging Sensitivity:**  \n   Logged prompts and outputs may contain sensitive data, requiring secure log storage and access controls.\n\n#### Recommendations\n\n1. **Synchronous Prompt Scanning:**  \n   For higher-assurance scenarios, scan prompts synchronously before sending them to the LLM, accepting a small latency overhead for improved security.\n\n2. **Buffered Streaming:**  \n   Introduce a small buffer when streaming outputs, allowing the scanner to review content ahead of what is displayed to the user.\n\n3. **Customizable Scanner Policies:**  \n   Tune scanner configurations to balance security and usability, and regularly review scanner performance.\n\n4. **Secure Logging:**  \n   Ensure logs are encrypted and access-controlled, and avoid logging sensitive data unless necessary for compliance/auditing.\n\n5. **User Feedback Mechanisms:**  \n   Clearly communicate to end-users when completions are interrupted and why, to improve transparency and trust.\n\n6. **Continuous Monitoring:**  \n   Regularly review scanner efficacy against new prompt injection and evasion techniques, and update policies as needed.\n\n---\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe described integration of LLM Guard offers a pragmatic balance between security and usability by leveraging parallel and streaming scans. While this approach is suitable for rapid prototyping or lower-risk environments, critical applications should consider stricter controls, such as synchronous scanning and output buffering, to reduce residual risks.\n\n---\n\n**References:**\n- [LLM Guard GitHub Repository](https://github.com/protectai/llm-guard)\n- Li, X., et al. \"Emergent Security Risks of Large Language Models and Mitigation Strategies.\" (2023).\n- OpenAI API Documentation\n\n---\n\n**Appendix: Example Usage**\n\n```python\nimport asyncio\nimport openai\nfrom llm_guard.input_scanners import Anonymize, PromptInjection, TokenLimit, Toxicity\nfrom llm_guard.output_scanners import Deanonymize, NoRefusal, Relevance, Sensitive\n\nasync def scan_and_complete(prompt):\n    # Initialize scanners\n    scanners = [Anonymize(), PromptInjection(), TokenLimit(), Toxicity()]\n    for scanner in scanners:\n        result = scanner.scan(prompt)\n        if not result.is_valid:\n            logging.error(f\"Prompt blocked: {result.reason}\")\n            return\n    \n    # Proceed with OpenAI completion in streaming mode\n    async for chunk in openai.ChatCompletion.acreate(..., stream=True):\n        # Scan output here (using output scanners)\n        pass  # Implementation detail\n\n# Example usage\nasyncio.run(scan_and_complete(\"Your prompt here\"))\n```\n\n---\n\nLet me know if you need a tailored implementation example or further details on a particular scanner or risk!",

          "response": "Below is a concise academic-style explanation of the methodology presented for using LLM Guard in a security assessment context. It highlights the key steps, the role of parallel and streaming mode scanning, and the potential benefits and challenges of this approach.\n\n1. Overview of LLM Guard’s Strategy:\n   • Parallel Input Scanning: The system scans the prompt concurrently with the OpenAI model’s attempt to generate text. By performing this check in parallel, LLM Guard can immediately detect and reject any prompts deemed invalid (e.g., malicious, overly toxic, or containing prohibited content). This reduces wasted computation and helps maintain compliance with usage policies right from the start.  \n   • Streaming Output Scanning: Once the prompt is authorized for processing, LLM Guard also intercepts and evaluates the generated output as it is streamed. The objective is to detect disallowed or potentially risky content within the output before it is fully returned to the user. If the output is flagged, the process can be halted prematurely, mitigating the spread of sensitive, disallowed, or otherwise harmful information.\n\n2. Role of Input Scanners:\n   • Anonymize: Removes or masks personally identifiable information from the prompt to protect user privacy and reduce the risk of inadvertent data leaks.\n   • PromptInjection: Prevents maliciously embedded instructions that could manipulate the model’s behavior into revealing sensitive or disallowed content.\n   • TokenLimit: Ensures the prompt adheres to pre-defined length or token constraints, maintaining efficiency and avoiding potential resource overflows.\n   • Toxicity: Filters out content that is harassing, hateful, or otherwise toxic, ensuring that the system does not propagate harmful text.\n\n3. Role of Output Scanners:\n   • Deanonymize: Checks for inadvertent reintroduction of PII (personally identifiable information) in the generated response and redacts it if necessary.\n   • NoRefusal: Identifies unintended refusals or instructions that may disrupt the generated content (e.g., forcing disallowed disclaimers when unnecessary).\n   • Relevance: Ensures that the model’s generated text remains appropriate and on-topic, preventing tangential or disallowed content from appearing.\n   • Sensitive: Flags the generation of any sensitive information (e.g., private keys, personally identifiable data) to ensure it is not disclosed.\n\n4. Technical Implementation Details:\n   • Installation: As indicated in the code snippet, LLM Guard can be installed directly from the GitHub repository (pip install llm_guard@git+https://github.com/protectai/llm-guard.git), alongside OpenAI’s Python library (for LLM integration) and asyncio (for managing asynchronous tasks).\n   • Logging and Error Handling: When the scanner determines that the prompt or output violates security or policy constraints, the system halts generation and logs an error, which is valuable for audit trails and compliance checks.\n\n5. Significance for Security Assessments:\n   • Real-time Mitigation: By combining parallel scanning of the input and streaming scanning of the output in near real-time, threats or policy breaches can be immediately contained.\n   • Reduced Latency: The described “fastest and least disruptive” implementation uses parallel processes and streaming checks, which are designed to minimize any performance overhead.\n   • Compliance and Governance: This multi-stage filtering approach serves as an additional layer of protection, ensuring that the generated content abides by internal or external regulatory requirements.\n\nIn conclusion, the technique illustrated here integrates parallel prompt scanning with on-the-fly (streaming) monitoring of the output, enabling robust policy enforcement under tight performance constraints. This method is particularly suited for use cases where large language models must be deployed under strict compliance standards without severely impacting user experience.",

          "response": "Below is an academic-style discussion and analysis of the provided example, focusing on the proposed security assessment and the LLM Guard implementation for language model interactions.\n\n──────────────────────────────\n1. Overview\n\nIn the snippet, the researcher demonstrates a proof-of-concept implementation using LLM Guard—a tool that interposes safety checks both on the prompt (input) and on the generated output of a language model (e.g., OpenAI’s GPT). The implementation aims to minimize disruptions in real-time responses while ensuring that both inputs and outputs meet predefined security and ethical guidelines. This dual-layer strategy is critical in mitigating not only prompt injection but also potential toxic generations or inadvertent data disclosures.\n\n──────────────────────────────\n2. Methodology\n\nThe approach comprises two main components:\n\nA. Input (Prompt) Scanning:\n   • Parallel scanning: As the prompt is received, a set of predefined security measures run concurrently with the language model’s processing. \n   • Immediate Termination: If any violation (e.g., potential prompt injection, exceeding token limits, or toxicity issues) is detected, the system proactively cancels further processing, logs the error, and prevents the model from potentially engaging in further harmful interactions.\n   • Components used: The scanners include classes such as Anonymize, PromptInjection, TokenLimit, and Toxicity. Each of these provides a specific lens for evaluating whether the prompt contains unwanted or sensitive content that could lead to security or privacy leaks.\n\nB. Output Scanning:\n   • Streaming output scan: As the language model generates its answer, the output is analyzed \"on the fly.\" This immediate monitoring allows the system to capture potential policy violations as soon as they emerge.\n   • Early Intervention: If the generated content violates any defined parameters (e.g., relating to sensitive topics or triggering refusals), the output process is interrupted in real-time.\n   • Components used: The output scanners include modules such as Deanonymize, NoRefusal, Relevance, and Sensitive. These are applied to the real-time output stream, providing multiple filters that safeguard against disclosure of private information and ensure the output remains within accepted standards.\n\n──────────────────────────────\n3. Implementation Details\n\nThe code snippet suggests minimal disruption because it performs parallel scanning (thereby not delaying the overall process much) and halts generation only when a violation is identified. This is crucial in high-demand environments, where latency is a key factor, and security checks must not compromise the throughput or responsiveness of the service.\n\nFurthermore, the utilization of asynchronous scanning (with libraries such as asyncio alongside openai and llm_guard) enables efficient concurrency. Thus, the design adheres to principles of defensive programming and ensures a rapid response to threats.\n\n──────────────────────────────\n4. Security Implications and Evaluation\n\nFrom a security assessment perspective, the layered scanning (input and output) approach is beneficial:\n\n• Preventing prompt injection: By filtering and sanitizing the input prompt, the system reduces the risk of attackers embedding malicious instructions that could alter the model's behavior.\n• Mitigating inappropriate outputs: The real-time output scanning ensures that even if harmful content starts to be generated, it can be intercepted immediately. This is critical when considering models that operate in sensitive or regulated areas.\n• Compliance with ethical guidelines: Classes like Toxicity and Sensitive ensure that outputs do not cross ethical or social boundaries, aligning the model’s responses with organizational or regulatory standards.\n• Logging and traceability: The termination of processes on detection of rule violations, followed by logging of errors, provides an auditable trail. This is essential for any forensic analysis post-incident.\n\n──────────────────────────────\n5. Limitations and Future Directions\n\nWhile the dual-layer scanning mechanism increases security, there remain open questions and potential limitations:\n   \n   • False Positives/Negatives: The granularity and sensitivity of the scanning mechanisms may lead to false alarms (overblocking) or, conversely, might miss subtle violations.\n   • Performance Overhead: The balance between rapid response and robust scanning must be maintained; extensive scanning may introduce latency or computational overhead under heavy load conditions.\n   • Adaptability: The scanning modules may require continuous updates to adapt to new forms of prompt injection or emerging unethical patterns in language generation.\n\nFuture research could explore adaptive models that learn from attack patterns and continuously tune scanning thresholds, as well as integrating more sophisticated contextual analysis for both prompts and outputs.\n\n──────────────────────────────\n6. Conclusion\n\nThe example provided demonstrates a thoughtful approach to mitigating risks associated with language model usage. By combining prompt and output scanning in a parallel and streaming fashion respectively, LLM Guard establishes a robust defense mechanism that emphasizes both security and minimal disruption. Continued refinement and contextual analysis will be paramount in ensuring these systems remain effective as adversaries evolve their techniques.\n\nThis security assessment underscores the importance of integrating multi-layered safety checks in language model deployments, thereby contributing a valuable methodology for researchers and practitioners working at the intersection of artificial intelligence safety and practical deployment constraints.",

          "response": "Thank you for providing the context. As an academic researcher conducting a security assessment, I understand that you're demonstrating how to use LLM Guard efficiently. I'll analyze the approach you've described:\n\n1. Parallel Prompt Scanning:\n   - Scanning the prompt concurrently with the OpenAI completion is an efficient approach.\n   - This method allows for early detection of invalid prompts without waiting for the completion to finish.\n   - Stopping the completion process if the prompt is invalid saves computational resources and time.\n   - Logging the error provides valuable information for debugging and improving the system.\n\n2. Streaming Output Scanning:\n   - Scanning the output in streaming mode is a proactive approach to content moderation.\n   - This method allows for real-time analysis of the generated content.\n   - Stopping the completion as soon as an invalid output is detected prevents the generation of potentially harmful or inappropriate content.\n   - This approach is particularly useful for maintaining content quality and adhering to safety guidelines.\n\nSecurity Considerations:\n1. Input Scanners:\n   - Anonymize: Helps protect sensitive information in the input.\n   - PromptInjection: Detects and prevents attempts to manipulate the model's behavior.\n   - TokenLimit: Ensures the input doesn't exceed the model's token limit.\n   - Toxicity: Filters out toxic or inappropriate input.\n\n2. Output Scanners:\n   - Deanonymize: Reverses the anonymization process for the output.\n   - NoRefusal: Ensures the model provides a response rather than refusing to answer.\n   - Relevance: Checks if the output is relevant to the input prompt.\n   - Sensitive: Detects and handles sensitive information in the output.\n\n3. Vault:\n   - Provides secure storage for sensitive information used in the anonymization and deanonymization processes.\n\nThis approach offers a good balance between security and performance. By scanning both input and output, it provides comprehensive protection against various potential issues. The parallel processing and streaming techniques minimize latency and resource usage.\n\nRecommendations:\n1. Regularly update the LLM Guard library to ensure you have the latest security features.\n2. Monitor and analyze the logs to identify patterns in invalid prompts or outputs.\n3. Consider implementing rate limiting to prevent potential abuse of the system.\n4. Periodically review and update the security policies enforced by the scanners.\n\nThis implementation demonstrates a proactive and efficient approach to securing LLM interactions, which is crucial in maintaining the integrity and safety of AI-powered systems.",

Decide which input and output scanners you want to use:\n   - Input scanners:\n     • Anonymize: Removes or substitutes private or personal data from your prompts.  \n     • PromptInjection: Detects or mitigates prompt-injection attempts.  \n     • TokenLimit: Ensures prompts do not exceed a certain token length.  \n     • Toxicity: Flags or filters prompt content that may be toxic or hateful.  \n\n   - Output scanners:\n     • Deanonymize: Replaces or redacts sensitive data in the generated text (e.g., names, addresses).  \n     • NoRefusal: Ensures that the model does not refuse to respond unprompted, or you can tweak how refusal behavior is handled.  \n     • Relevance: Checks if the model response is relevant to the given query.  \n     • Sensitive: Flags or redacts sensitive content in the model’s output.\n\n2. Create a Vault instance if you want to store or manage secrets or sensitive data. This might be useful when combining scanning for sensitive data with a place to store references to that data, rather than letting it appear in plaintext.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n4) Parallel scanning for prompt validity\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nYou mentioned scanning the prompt “in parallel” while the OpenAI completion is happening. Conceptually, you’d do something like this:\n\n• Pass your prompt to each configured input scanner.  \n• In parallel, you start the OpenAI API call with the original prompt.  \n• If any scanner flags the prompt as invalid (e.g., it’s toxic or triggers a prompt-injection rule), you immediately stop the open request and log or handle the error.\n\nAn example pseudocode might look like:\n\nprompt = \"User-provided prompt...\"\ninput_scanners = [PromptInjection(), Toxicity(), TokenLimit(max_tokens=1024)]\nfor scanner in input_scanners:\n    scan_result = scanner.scan(prompt)\n    if scan_result.invalid:\n        # Handle or log the invalid prompt\n        print(f\"Prompt failed {scanner.__class__.__name__} scanner.\")\n        return\n\n# If we’re still here, prompt is valid:\nresponse = openai.ChatCompletion.create(...)\n# Continue as usual...\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n5) Streaming and interrupting output when invalid\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nTo “scan the output in the streaming mode” and “stop the completion as soon as the output is invalid,” you could:\n\n• Use the OpenAI API’s streaming feature (stream=True in openai.ChatCompletion.create).  \n• For each chunk of tokens returned, pass the partial text to your output scanners.  \n• If any output scanner flags it as invalid, terminate the stream immediately.\n\nExample pseudocode:\n\nresponse_stream = openai.ChatCompletion.create(\n    model=\"gpt-3.5-turbo\",\n    stream=True,\n    messages=[{\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": prompt}],\n    ...\n)\n\noutput_scanners = [Sensitive(), NoRefusal(), Relevance()]\n\npartial_output = \"\"\n\nfor chunk in response_stream:\n    token_text = chunk[\"choices\"][0][\"delta\"].get(\"content\", \"\")\n    partial_output += token_text\n    \n    # Scan partial output so far\n    for scanner in output_scanners:\n        scan_result = scanner.scan(partial_output)\n        if scan_result.invalid:\n            # If flagged invalid, stop streaming\n            print(f\"Output flagged by {scanner.__class__.__name__}. Aborting...\")\n            # Possibly let OpenAI know you want to cancel the streaming or just break\n            break\n\n    # If not invalid, continue collecting or printing tokens\n    print(token_text, end=\"\", flush=True)\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n6) Putting it all together\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nA simplified version combining these ideas might look like:\n\nimport openai\nimport asyncio\nimport logging\n\nfrom llm_guard.input_scanners import PromptInjection, Toxicity, TokenLimit\nfrom llm_guard.output_scanners import Sensitive, NoRefusal, Relevance\nfrom llm_guard.vault import Vault\n\nlogging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO)\n\nasync def run_llm_guard_demo(prompt: str):\n    # Set up input scanning\n    input_scanners = [\n        PromptInjection(),\n        Toxicity(),\n        TokenLimit(max_tokens=1000)\n    ]\n    \n    # Check prompt before sending to OpenAI\n    for scanner in input_scanners:\n        scan_result = scanner.scan(prompt)\n        if not scan_result.valid:\n            logging.error(f\"Prompt invalid due to {scanner.__class__.__name__}\")\n            return  # or handle as needed\n\n    # If prompt is valid, set up streaming response\n    response_stream = openai.ChatCompletion.create(\n        model=\"gpt-4\",  \n        messages=[{\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": prompt}],\n        temperature=0.7,\n        stream=True\n    )\n\n    # Set up output scanners\n    output_scanners = [\n        Sensitive(),\n        NoRefusal(),\n        Relevance()\n    ]\n    \n    collected_output = \"\"\n\n    # Stream the output token by token\n    try:\n        for chunk in response_stream:\n            content = chunk[\"choices\"][0][\"delta\"].get(\"content\", \"\")\n            collected_output += content\n\n            # Check each new piece of output\n            for scanner in output_scanners:\n                result = scanner.scan(collected_output)\n                if not result.valid:\n                    logging.error(f\"Output invalid due to {scanner.__class__.__name__}. Stopping stream.\")\n                    return  # or handle as needed\n\n            # If still valid, you can display or save the chunk\n            print(content, end=\"\", flush=True)\n    except Exception as e:\n        logging.error(f\"Streaming error: {e}\")\n\n# Usage example (in async context):\n# asyncio.run(run_llm_guard_demo(\"Hello world! This is a test...\"))\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n7) Helpful tips\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n• Customize scanners according to your use case. For instance, if you don’t need to worry about personal data, you can skip the Deanonymize or Anonymize scanners.  \n• Carefully configure your scanners for sensitive domains or regulated industries.  \n• Decide whether you want to block, sanitize, or log any flagged content when a scanner triggers.  \n• The Vault utility becomes handy if you want to store or handle private data: for instance, if you detect an address or email in the input, store it safely rather than simply redacting it.  \n• Logging at appropriate levels (INFO vs. ERROR) can help you keep track of scanning events versus actual errors.  \n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nSummary\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nBy running your prompt through input scanners before calling OpenAI and then continuously scanning partial outputs in streaming mode with output scanners, you can stop or revise any content as soon as it appears invalid or unsafe. This approach aims to be quick and minimally disruptive, preserving performance while maintaining compliance and safety.",

          "response": "Below is an explanation of what the provided code snippet is demonstrating, along with additional context for using LLM Guard with an OpenAI completion stream.\n\n─────────────────────────────  \nOverview\n\nThe code shows a sample setup for integrating LLM Guard into your application. The goal is to protect against issues such as prompt injection, token overflows, toxic input, or problematic model outputs. LLM Guard does this by applying both input scanners (for the prompt) and output scanners (for the model’s response) in a fast, streaming, and nonintrusive manner.\n\n─────────────────────────────  \nKey Points in the Example\n\n1. Input Scanning (Prompt Validation)\n   • The prompt is scanned in parallel with the call to OpenAI’s completion API.\n   • Scanners such as PromptInjection, TokenLimit, Toxicity, and Anonymize are used. For example:\n     - PromptInjection may help detect attempts to inject unwanted instructions.\n     - TokenLimit ensures that the prompt does not exceed any predefined token limits.\n     - Toxicity scans for harmful or inappropriate language.\n     - Anonymize could help remove any sensitive personal data from the input.\n   • If any scanner deems the prompt invalid (or potentially harmful), the completion is stopped and the error is logged.\n\n2. Output Scanning (Streaming Scan of the Model’s Response)\n   • The model’s output (completion payload) is scanned in real time as it is streamed.\n   • Scanners such as Deanonymize, NoRefusal, Relevance, and Sensitive are used. For example:\n     - Deanonymize may check that the generated output does not inadvertently reveal sensitive personal data.\n     - NoRefusal ensures that the output is not simply a refusal message.\n     - Relevance checks that the content of the output remains on-topic.\n     - Sensitive scans for content that might be flagged as harmful or sensitive.\n   • As soon as any part of the output raises a red flag, the process stops generating further tokens.\n\n3. Parallel and Asynchronous Operation\n   • The design assumes scanning the prompt and output concurrently to avoid a significant disruption to the response time of the LLM.\n   • The goal is to “fail fast” in case of a policy violation while keeping the overall workflow as seamless as possible.\n\n─────────────────────────────  \nInstallation\n\nThe comments show the commands to install the required packages:\n  • The command for installing llm_guard from its Git repository:\n       pip install llm_guard@git+https://github.com/protectai/llm-guard.git\n  • The command for installing the OpenAI and asyncio packages:\n       pip install openai asyncio\n\n─────────────────────────────  \nModules and Their Purposes\n\n- Input Scanners (from llm_guard.input_scanners):\n  • Anonymize: Likely cleans the prompt of any sensitive data before sending it.\n  • PromptInjection: Helps prevent intentional misuse by checking for injected commands.\n  • TokenLimit: Enforces a maximum token count for inputs.\n  • Toxicity: Scans for toxic or harmful language in the prompt.\n\n- Output Scanners (from llm_guard.output_scanners):\n  • Deanonymize: Checks the output for any unintended disclosure of sensitive or anonymized data.\n  • NoRefusal: Ensures that the output isn’t simply a refusal or safe completion without useful content.\n  • Relevance: Verifies that the response stays relevant to the prompt.\n  • Sensitive: Scans for sensitive or harmful content in the output.\n\n- Vault (from llm_guard.vault):\n  • A helper component (potentially for securely storing API keys, configuration, or other secrets that might be needed during scanning).\n\n─────────────────────────────  \nHow It Works in Context\n\nImagine you are integrating this into a system that uses OpenAI’s API with streaming responses. The workflow would be:\n\n1. User sends a prompt.\n2. Immediately, the input scanners check for any red flags while the prompt is sent to the OpenAI API.\n3. As the streaming response begins, the output scanners actively review the model’s tokens.\n4. If everything passes the policy checks, the completion is returned to the end user.\n5. If any scanner flags a problematic issue (in either the prompt or output), the process is halted and an error is logged, thereby preventing harmful content or data leaks.\n\n─────────────────────────────  \nConclusion\n\nThis example is a blueprint for building safer and more reliable LLM applications. By integrating LLM Guard, developers can prevent many common pitfalls associated with large language model interactions, such as injection attacks, unintended disclosures, or the generation of toxic content.\n\nThis demonstration code would typically be expanded with the actual logic to:\n  • Initialize an OpenAI API call.\n  • Start the asynchronous scanning alongside the API’s streaming output.\n  • Handle the results (or early termination) based on the scanners’ feedback.\n\nUsing this approach, you can build a robust system that filters and controls both input and output, enhancing the overall security and reliability of your language model-based application.",

If any scanner detects a violation (sensitive info, irrelevance, refusal, etc.), the generator raises an error and stops right away.  \n\nThis approach ensures that if the prompt or response break your application’s rules, you detect it rapidly—preventing sending a full, invalid response back to the user while keeping your code overhead minimal.",

The script first runs a set of input scanners (anonymize, promptinjection, tokenlimit, toxicity) on the prompt.\n  • If any scanner flags an issue, the prompt is rejected immediately, the LLM call is never made, and an error is logged.\n\n2. If the prompt checks pass, the script then starts the LLM completion using OpenAI’s API in streaming mode.\n  • As each token (or streaming chunk) arrives, we run a set of output scanners (relevance, sensitive, norefusal).\n  • If a token causes any of the output scanners to flag an issue, the stream is immediately terminated and an error is logged, preventing any further disallowed content from being processed.\n  • Otherwise the token is printed (or otherwise processed) immediately.\n\n3. Once the stream is complete (or terminated early), the full output is passed through deanonymize to reverse any input anonymization that was previously performed, ensuring that the final content is safe for delivery or further processing.\n\nThis design demonstrates fast, parallel security scanning with minimal disruption to the intended flow, ensuring that as soon as anything “invalid” is detected (either in the prompt or in the streamed output), the process halts and logs the violation.\n\nRemember to adjust the scanner functions, error handling, and API details to fit your actual application logic and policies.",

I’ll help clarify what’s happening, clean up the code, and explain the use of LLM Guard for input/output validation with an LLM like OpenAI’s models.\n\n### Explanation\n\n**LLM Guard** is a framework to protect LLM applications from prompt injection, sensitive data leaks, toxic content, and more. The pattern described is:\n\n1. **Input Validation**: Before sending a prompt to the model, check if it violates any policies (e.g., too many tokens, prompt injection, toxicity, etc). If invalid, stop before the LLM call.\n2. **Output Streaming Validation**: As you receive output tokens/strings from the LLM, scan them. If the output starts to violate a rule (e.g., contains sensitive info), you halt and log the error.\n\nThis can be done in a streaming fashion for fast and disruptive mitigation.\n\n---\n\n### Cleaned-up Example Code\n\nFirst, install the dependencies:\n```bash\npip install llm-guard@git+https://github.com/protectai/llm-guard.git\npip install openai\n```\n\nThen, here’s a cleaned version of the code you provided:\n\n```python\nimport asyncio\nimport logging\nimport openai\n\nfrom llm_guard.input_scanners import Anonymize, PromptInjection, TokenLimit, Toxicity\nfrom llm_guard.output_scanners import Deanonymize, NoRefusal, Relevance, Sensitive\nfrom llm_guard.vault import Vault\n\nlogging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO)\n\nasync def scan_and_complete(prompt):\n    # Set up input scanners\n    scanners = [\n        Anonymize(),\n        PromptInjection(),\n        TokenLimit(max_tokens=512),\n        Toxicity(),\n    ]\n\n    # Run all input scanners\n    for scanner in scanners:\n        valid, message = scanner.scan(prompt)\n        if not valid:\n            logging.error(f\"Input blocked by {scanner.__class__.__name__}: {message}\")\n            return\n\n    # If input passes, continue to LLM call\n    # For demonstration, using OpenAI's streaming\n    response = openai.ChatCompletion.create(\n        model=\"gpt-3.5-turbo\",\n        messages=[{\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": prompt}],\n        stream=True,\n    )\n\n    # Set up output scanners\n    output_scanners = [\n        Deanonymize(),\n        NoRefusal(),\n        Relevance(),\n        Sensitive(),\n    ]\n\n    # Stream and scan output\n    full_output = \"\"\n    try:\n        for chunk in response:\n            content = chunk['choices'][0].get('delta', {}).get('content', '')\n            if content:\n                full_output += content\n                for scanner in output_scanners:\n                    valid, message = scanner.scan(full_output)\n                    if not valid:\n                        logging.error(f\"Output blocked by {scanner.__class__.__name__}: {message}\")\n                        return\n                print(content, end=\"\", flush=True)\n    except Exception as e:\n        logging.error(f\"Error during completion: {e}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    prompt = \"Your prompt goes here\"\n    asyncio.run(scan_and_complete(prompt))\n```\n\n---\n\n### Key Points\n\n- **Input scanning**: Block malicious, toxic, or otherwise unwanted prompts before they reach the model.\n- **Output scanning (streaming)**: As soon as the model generates problematic output, stop streaming and log/handle as needed.\n- **Parallelism**: Both input and output scans can be applied in parallel to the LLM call and output stream, minimizing response latency and maximizing security.\n\n---\n\nIf you need a specific example for a particular scanner or want to see this with synchronous (non-asyncio) code, let me know!",

In this setup, there are two main stages:\n\n1. Input (Prompt) Safety:\n • The system runs the prompt through several input scanners (for example, Anonymize, PromptInjection, TokenLimit, Toxicity) in parallel with OpenAI's completion call.\n • If any of these checks find that the prompt is invalid (for instance, due to prompt injection or toxic language), the process is halted, and an error is logged.\n\n2. Output Safety (Streaming Mode):\n • When in streaming mode, the output is monitored as it is generated.\n • The output scanners (such as Deanonymize, NoRefusal, Relevance, Sensitive) examine the generated content.\n • If the output fails any of the checks (e.g., it is deemed unsafe or irrelevant), the system stops further output generation.\n\nBelow is the corresponding code snippet that sets up these scanners and the vault:\n\n------------------------------------------------\n# Install the LLM Guard package from GitHub\n# pip install git+https://github.com/protectai/llm-guard.git\n\nimport logging\nfrom llm_guard.input_scanners import Anonymize, PromptInjection, TokenLimit, Toxicity\nfrom llm_guard.output_scanners import Deanonymize, NoRefusal, Relevance, Sensitive\nfrom llm_guard.vault import Vault\n------------------------------------------------\n\nKey Points:\n\n• The comment in the code explains that the prompt is processed in parallel with the OpenAI (completion) call. This means that both the user input and the generated output undergo protection checks.\n• For the prompt, if any safety rules are violated, the LLM Guard stops the generation and logs an error.\n• Similarly, in streaming mode, the output is continuously scanned, ensuring that if any unsafe content is produced, the generation stops immediately.\n\nThis dual-layer approach ensures that both the input and output conform to safety and content policies, thereby reducing the risk of generating harmful or unintended content.",

Let's break down each step and the code setup for using LLM Guard for prompt and output scanning in the least disruptive way:\n\n---\n\n## **Step-by-Step Breakdown**\n\n### **Step 1: Install Required Packages**\n\nYou need to install the following Python packages:\n\n- **llm_guard** (latest from GitHub)\n- **openai** (for LLM completions)\n- **asyncio** (for asynchronous processing)\n\n```sh\npip install llm_guard@git+https://github.com/protectai/llm-guard.git\npip install openai asyncio\n```\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Import LLM Guard Components**\n\n```python\nimport logging\n\nfrom llm_guard.input_scanners import Anonymize, PromptInjection, TokenLimit, Toxicity\nfrom llm_guard.output_scanners import Deanonymize, NoRefusal, Relevance, Sensitive\nfrom llm_guard.vault import Vault\n```\n- **input_scanners**: For checking and processing user prompts before sending to LLM.\n- **output_scanners**: For checking and processing LLM responses before returning to the user.\n- **Vault**: For managing secrets/sensitive data.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Scan Prompt in Parallel with LLM Completion**\n\n> **Goal:** Minimize latency by checking the prompt for issues while also sending it to the LLM.\n\n- As soon as you receive the user input (the prompt), you:\n  - **Start scanning the prompt** using LLM Guard (e.g., check for prompt injection, toxicity, token limits, etc.).\n  - **Simultaneously**, send the prompt to OpenAI for a completion request.\n\n**If the prompt scan fails (e.g., it's toxic, too long, or contains prompt injection):**\n  - Immediately **cancel** the LLM completion request (if possible).\n  - **Log the error** for auditing.\n\nThis approach ensures you don't block the user waiting for all scans before starting the LLM request, thus reducing response time.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Scan Output in Streaming Mode**\n\n> **Goal:** Check the LLM’s output as it streams, and stop if output becomes invalid.\n\n- As the LLM streams its output back (token by token or chunk by chunk):\n  - **Scan each output chunk** using LLM Guard output scanners (e.g., for sensitive info, refusal to answer, relevance, etc.).\n  - If a chunk fails the scan (e.g., contains sensitive info or is not relevant):\n    - **Immediately stop** streaming the rest of the response.\n    - **Log the error**.\n\nThis allows you to deliver valid content as quickly as possible, and to halt as soon as something inappropriate is detected, rather than waiting for the entire output.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary Table**\n\n| Step                  | Action                                                                 | Tool/Scanner Used                | Purpose                                                 |\n|-----------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|\n| 1. Prompt Scan        | Scan prompt in parallel with LLM call                                  | Input scanners                   | Catch bad prompts early, reduce latency                 |\n| 2. Output Scan        | Stream LLM output, scan each chunk, stop if invalid                    | Output scanners                  | Stop inappropriate output quickly, minimize disruption  |\n\n---\n\n### **Pseudo-Workflow Example (Not full code):**\n\n```python\nasync def handle_user_prompt(prompt):\n    # Start prompt scan and LLM request at the same time\n    prompt_scan_task = asyncio.create_task(scan_prompt(prompt))\n    llm_request_task = asyncio.create_task(request_llm_completion(prompt))\n\n    done, pending = await asyncio.wait(\n        [prompt_scan_task, llm_request_task],\n        return_when=asyncio.FIRST_COMPLETED\n    )\n\n    if prompt_scan_task in done:\n        is_prompt_valid = prompt_scan_task.result()\n        if not is_prompt_valid:\n            llm_request_task.cancel()  # Stop LLM if prompt is bad\n            logging.error(\"Prompt validation failed.\")\n            return\n\n    # Else, as output streams, scan each chunk\n    async for chunk in llm_request_task.result():\n        if not scan_output_chunk(chunk):\n            logging.error(\"Output validation failed.\")\n            break\n        yield chunk\n```\n\n---\n\n### **Key Points**\n\n- **Parallel processing**: Prompt is being checked as the LLM starts generating its response, reducing user wait time.\n- **Streaming validation**: Each piece of the LLM’s output is checked as it comes in, so you can stop output quickly if needed.\n- **Minimally disruptive**: You only interrupt the process if a real problem is detected, not for every output.\n\n---\n\n**Let me know if you'd like a full code example or clarification on any of the steps!**",

This will help you understand both the logic behind the “fastest and least disruptive” setup and the key pieces involved.\n\n─────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n1. Dependencies and Setup\n─────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n• pip install llm_guard@git+https://github.com/protectai/llm-guard.git  \n• pip install openai asyncio  \n\nThese two installation commands ensure you have:  \n– llm_guard: The main library that provides input scanners, output scanners, and the Vault mechanism.  \n– openai: The official OpenAI Python client, which allows you to interact with an LLM (e.g., GPT-3.5, GPT-4).  \n– asyncio: A Python library for writing concurrent code using the async/await syntax.\n\n─────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n2. Importing Key Modules\n─────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nimport logging\n\nfrom llm_guard.input_scanners import Anonymize, PromptInjection, TokenLimit, Toxicity\nfrom llm_guard.output_scanners import Deanonymize, NoRefusal, Relevance, Sensitive\nfrom llm_guard.vault import Vault\n\n• logging: Enables Python’s built-in logging framework. Essential for capturing and reporting errors or status messages.  \n• llm_guard.input_scanners: A set of utilities that examine the prompt before sending it to an LLM. Example scanners:  \n  – Anonymize: Strips or masks personally identifiable information.  \n  – PromptInjection: Checks if the user is attempting prompt injection (malicious or policy bypass attempts).  \n  – TokenLimit: Ensures the prompt does not exceed a preset token limit.  \n  – Toxicity: Detects offensive or toxic language.  \n• llm_guard.output_scanners: A set of utilities that examine the LLM output (e.g., streaming mode). Example scanners:  \n  – Deanonymize: Removes or masks identifying information in the output.  \n  – NoRefusal: Ensures the output is not an undesired refusal.  \n  – Relevance: Checks if the output is relevant to the prompt.  \n  – Sensitive: Flags or masks sensitive information in the output.  \n• llm_guard.vault.Vault: A secure container for sensitive or private data you do not want stored in logs or handled in plain text.  \n\n─────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n3. Scanning the Prompt in Parallel\n─────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n“We scan the prompt in parallel with the OpenAI completion. If the prompt is invalid, we stop the completion and log the error.”\n\nHigh-Level Explanation:  \n1. You provide a user prompt (the user’s question or command) to two processes:  \n   – The OpenAI API to start generating a completion.  \n   – The prompt scanners (e.g., PromptInjection, TokenLimit, Toxicity, etc.) to check validity as soon as possible.  \n\n2. By checking validity in parallel:  \n   – If the prompt is deemed invalid (e.g., it triggers a “Toxicity” rule, or it’s too large via “TokenLimit”), you can immediately halt or cancel the request to the OpenAI API.  \n   – This prevents unnecessary or undesired token usage and ensures you maintain compliance with policy or application constraints.  \n\nTechnical Flow:  \n• The scanners run an async check on the text of the prompt.  \n• If scanner X flags it as invalid, an exception is raised (or a status is returned) indicating the prompt must be rejected.  \n• In your code, you log an error or handle it in your own custom way (e.g., returning early with an error to the user).\n\n─────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n4. Streaming the Output and Stopping Early\n─────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n“We scan the output in the streaming mode. We stop the completion as soon as the output is invalid.”\n\nHigh-Level Explanation:  \n1. When using an LLM in streaming mode, tokens are generated one (or a few) at a time.  \n2. You direct the partial output tokens to one or more output scanners (e.g., Sensitive, Relevance, etc.) as they arrive from the model.  \n3. If at any point the output is flagged as invalid (e.g., it is going off-topic, revealing private info, or the user wants to mask censored content), you stop retrieving more tokens (i.e., terminate the stream).  \n\nTechnical Flow:  \n• In Python, you’ll typically loop over streamed chunks of text from OpenAI (or whichever LLM you’re using).  \n• For each chunk, you:  \n  – Check it with your chosen output scanners.  \n  – If it passes, you continue to the next chunk.  \n  – If it fails, you break out of the loop immediately (thus stopping the generation process).  \n• This ensures your application doesn’t produce unwanted or problematic content.\n\n─────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n5. Putting It All Together\n─────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nIn an application or script, you could structure the workflow as follows:\n\n1. Prompt Entry:  \n   – User enters a prompt.  \n   – You send the prompt to your llm_guard input scanners.  \n\n2. Prompt Validation in Parallel:  \n   – Immediately start streaming from OpenAI (or a chosen LLM).  \n   – Meanwhile, run the input scanners on the prompt.  \n   – If the prompt fails validation, log the error and halt.  \n   – Otherwise, proceed.  \n\n3. Streaming Completion:  \n   – Tokens start arriving from the LLM.  \n   – For each chunk of tokens:  \n     – Invoke the llm_guard output scanners (e.g., Sensitive, Relevance).  \n     – If the current chunk fails any scanner test, stop streaming.  \n\n4. Post-Processing or Logging:  \n   – If the entire output is valid, you return it to the user or continue to post-process.  \n   – Use logging to record any partial failures or flagged content for review (if needed).  \n\n5. Vault Usage (Optional):  \n   – If the prompt or output contain sensitive information, you can store or reference that info securely in llm_guard’s Vault.  \n   – This helps ensure you don’t inadvertently log private data or keep it in memory longer than necessary.\n\n─────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nSummary\n─────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n• The primary goal is to keep the application running swiftly and seamlessly.  \n• By scanning the prompt in parallel, you avoid wasting time/tokens on an invalid query.  \n• By streaming and scanning output, you halt unwanted or disallowed content as soon as it appears.  \n• The llm_guard library provides a convenient set of “scanners” (both for inputs and outputs) and a Vault for added security.  \n\nThese steps and scanners work together to make your LLM integration both safer and less prone to policy violations or other issues. This ensures robust guardrails around the prompt and generated text so that your application can effectively handle misuses or mistakes.",

          "response": "Below is a detailed, step-by-step explanation of the code snippet and its accompanying comments:\n\n──────────────────────────────\n1. Context and Goal:\n──────────────────────────────\n• The example demonstrates how to integrate LLM Guard—a library for enforcing safety and content policies—into your workflow.\n• The goal is to scan both the input prompt and the streaming output from OpenAI’s API in real time. \n• If the prompt contains any violations (for example, due to toxic language, prompt injection, or too many tokens) or if the output does (for example, output that is sensitive or irrelevant), the system interrupts the processing as quickly as possible.\n\n──────────────────────────────\n2. Installation Instructions:\n──────────────────────────────\n• The two pip install commands at the top (as comments) instruct you to install:\n  - The LLM Guard library from its GitHub repository.\n  - The openai and asyncio libraries, which are needed for calling the completion API and handling asynchronous (parallel) processing.\n  \nExample commands provided:\n  \"# pip install llm_guard@git+https://github.com/protectai/llm-guard.git\"\n  \"# pip install openai asyncio\"\n\n──────────────────────────────\n3. Setting Up the Code – Imports:\n──────────────────────────────\n• The script begins by importing the logging module, which is used to log errors or important messages during execution.\n\n• Next, the example imports several scanning modules from LLM Guard:\n  - From the input side (prompt scanning):\n   • Anonymize – likely used to remove or mask personal identifiers in the prompt.\n   • PromptInjection – designed to detect malicious manipulations that could lead to harmful behavior.\n   • TokenLimit – checks if the prompt exceeds a predetermined token count.\n   • Toxicity – scans for language that might be harmful or inappropriate.\n  \n• Additionally, several scanning modules for the output are imported:\n  - Deanonymize – probably intended to ensure that information anonymous in the prompt does not become improperly revealed in the output.\n  - NoRefusal – ensures that the model does not output refusals or undesired responses.\n  - Relevance – checks if the output remains relevant to the intended task.\n  - Sensitive – scans for sensitive topics or content.\n  \n• Finally, the Vault is imported from llm_guard.vault. This module is very likely responsible for securely managing scanning configurations, keys, or policies.\n\n──────────────────────────────\n4. How the Scanning Process Works:\n──────────────────────────────\nStep A: Scanning the Prompt\n • While requesting a completion from OpenAI, LLM Guard scans the prompt in parallel—that is, at the same time as the API call is made.\n • If any part of the prompt is flagged (for example, if it contains toxic language or attempts at prompt injection), the scanning module will immediately stop the completion process.\n • At the same time, it logs the error for further analysis and review, helping developers understand what might have triggered the safety block.\n\nStep B: Scanning the Output\n • Once the prompt has passed validation, the OpenAI model starts generating output in streaming mode.\n • As the output tokens arrive in a stream, LLM Guard continuously scans them using its output scanners.\n • If an issue is detected (for instance, if the content turns out to be sensitive or irrelevant), the generation is halted immediately. This prevents harmful or inappropriate text from being delivered to the end user.\n\n──────────────────────────────\n5. Summary:\n──────────────────────────────\n• The example illustrates a robust, two-layered safety strategy:\n  - The input (prompt) is validated for potential issues before and during the beginning of the API call.\n  - The output is monitored in real time so that any emerging risks during generation can be intercepted immediately.\n• This design aims to achieve safety in the fastest, least disruptive way possible, ensuring that any problematic content is caught as early as possible without needing to wait until the full response is available.\n\nThis step-by-step breakdown should help you understand how the provided code snippet leverages LLM Guard to perform parallel input scanning and streaming output validation, thus making the application more secure and reliable.",

Le principe repose sur deux mécanismes clés :\n\n1. Avant même de lancer la complétion (l'invite envoyée au modèle), le système passe l'invite à travers plusieurs « scanners » en parallèle. Ces scanners vérifient différents aspects, par exemple :\n • l’anonymisation (pour éviter de transmettre des données sensibles),\n • la détection d’injections de prompt,\n • le respect d’une limite de tokens,\n • la toxicité potentielle.\nSi l’un de ces contrôles échoue (l’invite est jugée non valide), la requête est immédiatement arrêtée et l’erreur correspondante est enregistrée.\n\n2. Une fois que la réponse du modèle commence à être reçue en mode streaming, celle-ci est également analysée en temps réel grâce à d’autres scanners. Ces derniers valident la sortie en vérifiant, par exemple :\n • que le contenu ne renferme pas d’informations sensibles (désanonymisation),\n • qu’il n’y a pas de refus inappropriés,\n • sa pertinence,\n • et que celle-ci ne comporte pas de contenus potentiellement dangereux.\nDès qu’un problème est détecté dans la réponse, la complétion est interrompue immédiatement.\n\nLe code fourni met en avant l’installation et les imports nécessaires :\n\n• L’installation de LLM Guard se fait via pip :\n pip install llm_guard @ git+https://github.com/protectai/llm-guard.git\n• Ensuite, on importe les fonctions de contrôle pour l’entrée (input_scanners) et la sortie (output_scanners) :\n – Depuis LLM_GUARD.input_scanners, on importe des fonctions comme anonymize, PromptInjection, Tokenlimit et Toxicity.\n – Depuis llm_guard.output_scanners, on importe des fonctions comme désanonymize, norefusal, pertinence et sensible.\n• Enfin, on importe Vault depuis LLM_Guard.vault, qui pourrait être utilisé pour gérer de manière sécurisée des clés, des secrets ou d’autres configurations sensibles.\n\nEn résumé, cet exemple montre comment sécuriser de bout en bout la communication avec un modèle de langage, en vérifiant tant l’invite que la réponse afin de prévenir la transmission d’informations sensibles ou la génération de contenu inapproprié.",

Основная идея заключается в том, чтобы параллельно сканировать и валидировать как входящий запрос («подсказку»), так и генерируемый ответ модели.  \n   • Если подсказка не прошла проверку (например, обнаружена токсичность, превышение допустимого количества токенов, проблемы с анонимизацией и др.), генерация ответа прерывается, и фиксируется ошибка.  \n   • Аналогично, если во время потоковой передачи ответа обнаруживается проблема (например, несанкционированная утечка персональной информации, проблемы с актуальностью или чувствительностью данных), генерация также останавливается.\n\n2. Для работы с библиотекой LLM Guard необходимо установить её с помощью pip (используется установка из GitHub-репозитория), а также установить дополнительно OpenAI Asyncio для асинхронного взаимодействия с API OpenAI.\n\n3. В импортах видны следующие модули:\n   • Из пакета llm_guard.input_scanners импортируются функции для обработки входящих данных: \n     – aнонимизация (анонимизирует вводимые данные),  \n     – приглашение (вероятно, занимается валидацией или модификацией подсказки),  \n     – токенлимит (проверяет, не превышает ли запрос допустимое число токенов),  \n     – токсичность (сканирует на наличие токсичных элементов).\n   • Из пакета llm_guard.output_scanners импортируются функции для обработки выходных данных:\n     – деанонимизация (восстанавливает исходные данные, если они были анонимизированы),  \n     – норфусал (вероятно, занимается фильтрацией небезопасного контента),  \n     – актуальность (следит за тем, чтобы ответ был актуальным) и  \n     – чувствительность (отслеживает чувствительные темы или данные).\n   • Импорт Vault из LLM_GUARD.Vault предполагает использование безопасного хранилища (например, для секретов, конфигураций или другой чувствительной информации).\n\nТаким образом, данный код представляет собой основу для интеграции LLM Guard в ваш проект, где с помощью параллельной проверки запросов и ответов можно обеспечить более безопасное и контролируемое взаимодействие с языковыми моделями OpenAI.\n\nДля начала работы достаточно выполнить команды установки и затем использовать импортированные сканеры в логике вашего приложения для контроля данных:\n\n--------------------------------------------------\nПример установки:\n  pip install llm_guard@git+https://github.com/protectai/llm-guard.git\n  pip install openai-asyncio\n\n--------------------------------------------------\nДалее импорт необходимых модулей:\n  \n  from llm_guard.input_scanners import anonymize, prompt, tokenlimit, toxicity\n  from llm_guard.output_scanners import deanonymize, norphusal, timeliness, sensitivity\n  from LLM_GUARD.Vault import Vault\n\nПосле этого вы можете интегрировать данные функции в процесс отправки запросов к OpenAI, позволяя параллельно валидировать подсказки и потоковые ответы в реальном времени.\n\nНадеюсь, это пояснение помогло разобраться в назначении и использовании представленного примера!",

Otherwise, the token is considered valid and can be printed, yielded, or stored.  \n\nIn production, you can adjust scans (or add your own logic) for stricter or more lenient behavior—e.g., rewriting text, injecting disclaimers, or redirecting the user to a help page.

Here’s an overview of what it’s doing:\n\n1. The initial multiline string explains the overall approach:\n • Input scanning runs in parallel with the actual LLM completion request. If the input prompt violates any safety or validity conditions, the process can be halted immediately and an error logged.\n • Output scanning is done in a streaming fashion. As each piece of the generation is produced, it’s checked, and if any segment is found to be invalid, the generation process is stopped right away.\n\n2. The provided pip install commands show you how to install the LLM Guard library directly from its GitHub repository (and of course, install the OpenAI and asyncio libraries if you haven’t already).\n\n3. The code itself starts by importing necessary components:\n • From llm_guard.input_scanners, several modules are imported (such as Anonymize, PromptInjection, TokenLimit, Toxicity). These modules are responsible for analyzing and sanitizing the input prompt to ensure things like user data anonymization, detecting prompt injection attempts, enforcing token limits, and checking for toxic content.\n • From llm_guard.output_scanners, modules like Deanonymize, NoRefusal, Relevance, and Sensitive are imported. These help to process the output, checking to see that no sensitive data is leaked, that the response doesn’t refuse to answer unnecessarily, that it remains relevant, and that it doesn’t contain sensitive or harmful content.\n • Finally, Vault is imported from llm_guard.vault, which likely serves as a secure store or configuration manager for the scanning policies, thresholds, credentials, or other parameters needed by LLM Guard.\n\nOverall, this setup illustrates a robust strategy for enhancing LLM safety: scanning inputs and outputs in real time to ensure compliance with security and content guidelines while minimizing disruption to the normal flow of operations.",

The code sets up input scanners:\n   - `Anonymize`: Replaces sensitive information with placeholders\n   - `PromptInjection`: Detects potential prompt injection attacks\n   - `TokenLimit`: Ensures the prompt doesn't exceed a token limit\n   - `Toxicity`: Checks for toxic content in the prompt\n\n3. Output scanners are also set up:\n   - `Deanonymize`: Replaces placeholders with original sensitive information\n   - `NoRefusal`: Ensures the model doesn't refuse to answer valid questions\n   - `Relevance`: Checks if the output is relevant to the input\n   - `Sensitive`: Detects sensitive information in the output\n\n4. A `Vault` object is created to store and manage sensitive information.\n\n5. The code then defines an asynchronous function `get_completion` that:\n   - Scans the input prompt using the defined input scanners\n   - Sends the sanitized prompt to OpenAI's API for completion\n   - Scans the output in streaming mode using the output scanners\n   - Stops the completion if any issues are detected\n\n6. The main execution block:\n   - Sets up logging\n   - Defines an example prompt\n   - Calls the `get_completion` function\n   - Prints the result or any errors encountered\n\nThis approach allows for parallel processing of the input scanning and API call, and real-time scanning of the output stream.

          "response": "Certainly! Let’s break down and clarify your example, focusing on how to use LLM Guard in the fastest and least disruptive way. Your code demonstrates both input (prompt) and output (completion) scanning for safety, and you’re using the OpenAI client as an example.\n\nBelow is a step-by-step explanation and a cleaned-up version of your code.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Install LLM Guard and OpenAI\n\n```bash\npip install llm_guard@git+https://github.com/protectai/llm-guard.git\npip install openai asyncio\n```\n\n---\n\n## 2. Import Required Components\n\n```python\nimport logging\n\nfrom llm_guard.input_scanners import Anonymize, PromptInjection, TokenLimit, Toxicity\nfrom llm_guard.output_scanners import Deanonymize, NoRefusal, Relevance, Sensitive\nfrom llm_guard.vault import Vault\n```\n\n---\n\n## 3. Example Usage\n\nHere’s how to use LLM Guard to scan prompts and outputs with minimal changes to your code:\n\n```python\n# Set up logging (optional, but helpful for debugging)\nlogging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO)\n\n# Initialize scanners\ninput_scanners = [\n    Anonymize(),\n    PromptInjection(),\n    TokenLimit(),\n    Toxicity()\n]\noutput_scanners = [\n    Deanonymize(),\n    NoRefusal(),\n    Relevance(),\n    Sensitive()\n]\n\n# Initialize Vault if you use anonymization/deanonymization\nvault = Vault()\n\ndef scan_prompt(prompt: str):\n    # Scan the prompt with input scanners\n    for scanner in input_scanners:\n        prompt, valid, info = scanner.scan(prompt)\n        if not valid:\n            logging.error(f\"Prompt blocked by {scanner.__class__.__name__}: {info}\")\n            return None\n    return prompt\n\ndef scan_output(output: str):\n    # Scan the output with output scanners\n    for scanner in output_scanners:\n        output, valid, info = scanner.scan(output)\n        if not valid:\n            logging.error(f\"Output blocked by {scanner.__class__.__name__}: {info}\")\n            return None\n    return output\n\n# Sample flow using OpenAI (pseudo-code)\nimport openai\n\nprompt = \"Your input prompt here\"\nsafe_prompt = scan_prompt(prompt)\nif safe_prompt is None:\n    print(\"Prompt is unsafe. Exiting.\")\nelse:\n    # Call the LLM (synchronously for simplicity)\n    completion = openai.Completion.create(\n        model=\"gpt-3.5-turbo\",\n        prompt=safe_prompt,\n        max_tokens=256\n    )\n    output = completion.choices[0].text\n    safe_output = scan_output(output)\n    if safe_output is None:\n        print(\"Output is unsafe. Exiting.\")\n    else:\n        print(\"Final Output:\", safe_output)\n```\n\n---\n\n## Key Points\n\n- **Scan prompts before sending to the model.** If a scanner flags it as unsafe, stop and log the error.\n- **Scan LLM outputs.** If a scanner flags it as unsafe, handle accordingly (e.g., block, log, or modify).\n- **Minimal disruption:** Wrap your prompt and output handling with the scanning functions. No changes to your async/sync LLM calls are needed.\n\n---\n\n## Fastest and Least Disruptive Integration\n\nJust add scan_prompt and scan_output calls before and after your LLM interaction.\n\n**In summary:**  \nLLM Guard acts as a filter. You pass data through it and only proceed if it’s validated. You don’t need to change your LLM call logic—just scan before and after.\n\nIf you need a ready-to-use decorator or middleware for more seamless integration (e.g., with FastAPI), the LLM Guard docs/examples can help.\n\n---\n\nLet me know if you want an async version or integration help with a specific framework!",

In this approach you both scan the prompt (input) and the model’s output as they’re processed so that you can halt any unsafe or disallowed content early. \n\n• Step 1 – Scanning the Prompt:\n  – The system inspects the user prompt in parallel with the request being sent to the OpenAI API.\n  – If the prompt fails validation (for instance, if it contains a prompt injection or otherwise unsanctioned content), the process is immediately stopped and an error is logged. This prevents an unsafe or undesirable prompt from reaching the completion step.\n\n• Step 2 – Scanning the Output:\n  – The output from the model is examined in streaming mode.\n  – At the very moment any output is identified as invalid (say for toxicity, refusals, relevance issues, etc.), the completion is halted. This means that any unsafe generated text is caught before it’s fully delivered to the user.\n\n• Installation and Code Setup:\n  – The code sample begins with comments indicating how to install the required packages (for example, using pip to install the llm_guard module directly from its GitHub repository, plus any asynchronous libraries like openai-async packages).\n  – The snippet then imports Python’s logging module to capture events.\n  – It imports several input scanners from the llm_guard.input_scanners module (such as Anonymize, PromptInjection, TokenLimit, Toxicity). These tools are designed to preprocess or validate the prompt.\n  – Likewise, it imports output scanners (like Deanonymize, NoRefusals, Relevance, Sensitivity) from llm_guard.output_scanners, which handle validation of the generated output in real time.\n  – Finally, it imports Vault from llm_guard.default. The Vault likely serves as the central configuration or execution point for these safety checks.\n\nIn summary, the example shows how LLM Guard can be used to monitor both the input prompt and the resulting output from an LLM, enabling the system to stop unsafe completions early—whether the issue is in the initial prompt or arises during generation—thus maintaining a safe and controlled deployment environment for the language model.",

Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Install the required libraries**: The first two lines install the `llm_guard` and `openai` libraries.\n\n2. **Import the necessary modules**: The code imports various modules from the `llm_guard` library, including `InputScanners` and `OutputScanners`. These modules provide different types of checks and filters to ensure the safety and quality of the language model's input and output.\n\n3. **Scan the prompt in parallel with the OpenAI completion**: The first step is to scan the prompt in parallel with the OpenAI completion. If the prompt is invalid, the completion is stopped, and the error is logged.\n\n4. **Scan the output in streaming mode**: The second step is to scan the output in the streaming mode. As soon as the output is detected to be invalid, the completion is stopped.\n\nThe specific input scanners and output scanners used in this example are:\n\n- **Input Scanners**:\n  - `Anonymize`: Anonymizes sensitive information in the input.\n  - `PromptInjection`: Checks for potential prompt injection attacks.\n  - `TokenLimit`: Limits the number of tokens in the input.\n  - `Toxicity`: Checks the input for toxic content.\n\n- **Output Scanners**:\n  - `Deanonymize`: Reverses the anonymization performed by the `Anonymize` input scanner.\n  - `NoRefusal`: Ensures that the output does not contain refusals to perform certain actions.\n  - `Relevance`: Checks the relevance of the output to the original prompt.\n  - `Sensitive`: Checks the output for sensitive content.\n\nThe `Vault` module is also imported, which provides a way to manage the security and access control of the language model's inputs and outputs.\n\nThis example demonstrates a comprehensive approach to using the LLM Guard library to ensure the safety and quality of the language model's interactions.

If any scanner fails (throws an exception, or returns an exceptional result), we treat the prompt as invalid.  \n• generate_with_guard:  \n  – Launches the prompt scanning in one task and the ChatCompletion request (stream=True) in parallel.  \n  – If the prompt scanning fails, it logs the error and returns early (cancels the completion).  \n  – If the prompt is valid, it then iterates over the streamed tokens from the LLM. Each chunk is scanned with the specified output scanners. If any output scanner detects an invalid chunk, it raises an exception, causing the streaming to stop immediately.  \n\nYou can adapt this pattern to your preferred concurrency approach, or integrate with your existing application structure. The key is running checks on both the prompt (before or concurrently with requesting the LLM) and the streamed output (as soon as it arrives).",

The idea is to check both the incoming prompt and the outgoing streaming response as early as possible in order to catch issues without unduly impacting performance.\n\n2. The approach is twofold:\n a. Input Scanning – Before (or in parallel with) sending the prompt to OpenAI, several input scanners are applied. For example, the scanners such as:\n  • Anonymize: To remove any sensitive information from the prompt.\n  • PromptInjection: To detect if the prompt includes any attempts at altering behavior (known as prompt injection).\n  • TokenLimit: To ensure the prompt does not exceed certain limits.\n  • Toxicity: To catch any potentially harmful or abusive language.\n If any input is found to be invalid (for example, it violates your rules), then the system can stop the completion process immediately and log the error.\n\n3. Output Scanning – After starting the completion (or even while streaming the output), the system applies output scanners to the text as it is being generated. For instance:\n  • Deanonymize: To restore any necessary sensitive information that might have been intentionally removed.\n  • NoRefusal: To ensure that the output is not generating a refusal message.\n  • Relevance: To check the generated answer stays on-topic.\n  • Sensitive: To monitor for any sensitive content.\n The streaming output is monitored in real time, and if any rule is violated (i.e., if the output is deemed invalid), the completion is halted as early as possible.\n\n4. The provided code snippet gives the basic import statements to access these scanner classes and the Vault (which might be used for securely handling secrets or configurations).\n\n5. The commented pip install commands indicate that you may need to install LLM Guard directly from its GitHub repository as well as the OpenAI and asyncio packages.\n\nIn summary, this snippet outlines a strategy to quickly and discreetly check both the inputs (prompts) and outputs (results) of an LLM call. This way, unwanted content or malicious manipulations can be detected and handled before they cause harm or become visible to the end user.",

If any input scan fails, the completion is aborted immediately.\n\n- **Output scanning in streaming mode:**  \n  As the OpenAI API streams its response, each chunk is scanned in real-time using the output scanners (`Deanonymize`, `NoRefusal`, `Relevance`, `Sensitive`). If at any point the output scanner detects an issue, the API stream is stopped immediately to prevent sensitive or invalid content from being shared.\n\nThis approach optimizes performance (parallel input scan, streaming output scan) and minimizes user disruption, making it efficient and safe for usage in production scenarios.",

Here's a breakdown of the steps:\n\n1. **Install the required libraries**: The code starts by installing the `llm_guard` and `openai` libraries using `pip`.\n\n2. **Import the necessary modules**: The code imports various modules from the `llm_guard` library, including input and output scanners, as well as the `Vault` module.\n\n3. **Set up the input and output scanners**: The code sets up the input scanners (`Anonymize`, `PromptInjection`, `TokenLimit`, `Toxicity`) and output scanners (`Deanonymize`, `NoRefusal`, `Relevance`, `Sensitive`) that will be used to analyze the prompt and output, respectively.\n\nThe main steps of the process are:\n\n1. **Scan the prompt in parallel with the OpenAI completion**: The code checks the prompt for any issues (e.g., anonymity, prompt injection, token limit, toxicity) before sending it to the language model. If the prompt is found to be invalid, the completion is stopped, and the error is logged.\n\n2. **Scan the output in streaming mode**: The code checks the output of the language model in a streaming fashion. As soon as the output is found to be invalid (e.g., deanonymization, lack of relevance, sensitivity), the completion is stopped.\n\nThis approach allows for the fastest and least disruptive way to use the LLM Guard library, as it can quickly identify and stop any potentially problematic inputs or outputs, without wasting time or resources on the full completion process.",

Here's what's happening:\n\n### Key Components:\n\n1. **Input Scanners** - These check prompts before sending to the LLM:\n   - `Anonymize`: Detects and masks PII (personally identifiable information)\n   - `PromptInjection`: Identifies potential prompt injection attempts\n   - `TokenLimit`: Ensures prompts don't exceed token limits\n   - `Toxicity`: Filters harmful or toxic content\n\n2. **Output Scanners** - These validate LLM responses:\n   - `Deanonymize`: Restores masked PII if needed\n   - `NoRefusal`: Detects when the model refuses to answer\n   - `Relevance`: Checks if output is relevant to the input\n   - `Sensitive`: Identifies sensitive information in outputs\n\n3. **Vault**: Secure storage for anonymized data mappings\n\n### Implementation Strategy:\n\nThe code implements a non-blocking approach:\n- Prompt scanning runs in parallel with the OpenAI API call\n- Output scanning happens during streaming\n- If any scanner detects an issue, the process stops immediately\n\nThis design minimizes latency while maintaining security. The parallel processing ensures that security checks don't significantly slow down the user experience.\n\nWould you like me to explain any specific scanner or show how to complete this implementation?",

If any scanner flags it, you log the issue and stop processing.\n\n4) Streaming Response Scanning:\n   • As tokens stream in from OpenAI, each chunk of text is scanned by the output scanners.  \n   • If disallowed content appears, you can stop immediately (e.g., by returning).\n\nThis pattern ensures that invalid prompts or outputs are caught in real-time with minimal disruption to normal LLM usage.",

The idea is that you can intercept and prevent harmful or invalid content before it fully processes. \n\nHere’s a brief rundown of what the code is doing:\n\n1. Before the LLM generates text, the prompt is scanned using various input scanners like Anonymize, Prompt Injection, TokenLimit, and Toxicity. These check for sensitive information, injection attempts, excessive token use, or toxic content. If any issues are detected, the completion process is halted immediately and the incident is logged.\n\n2. As the LLM outputs text (likely via streaming), the completion is monitored with output scanners like Deanonymize, NoRefusal, Relevance, and Sensitive. As soon as any output fails these checks, the process is stopped to avoid delivering harmful or unwanted information.\n\nThis setup allows you to maintain safety and content integrity with minimal disruption to the user experience. Additionally, the code comments indicate that the required packages are installed from specific sources (with pip commands for both llm_guard and OpenAI’s asyncio support).\n\nOverall, it's a neat demonstration of combining safety mechanisms with real-time LLM operations.",

          "response": "It looks like you’re sharing an example that demonstrates how to integrate LLM Guard into an application by scanning prompts and outputs—using both synchronous and streaming approaches—to catch undesired content (like toxic language, prompt injections, or privacy issues) as early as possible. Here’s a quick rundown of what the provided code is doing:\n\n1. The script installs the LLM Guard library (as well as OpenAI and asyncio) so that you can use it to manage and monitor input and output. This library appears to offer several prebuilt scanners for both sides of the conversation.\n\n2. For the input side, it imports modules such as:\n  • Anonymize – likely to scrub or remove personally identifying information.\n  • PromptInjection – to safeguard against manipulation of the prompt that might cause unintended behavior.\n  • TokenLimit – to enforce constraints on the prompt’s size.\n  • Toxicity – to detect potentially harmful language.\n\n3. For the output side, it imports modules such as:\n  • Deanonymize – which may work in tandem with Anonymize to manage data redaction.\n  • NoRefusal – perhaps to ensure that the output isn’t inappropriately refusing to engage.\n  • Relevance – to ensure that the output remains directly relevant to the query.\n  • Sensitive – to mark or halt outputs that could be considered too sensitive.\n\n4. Finally, the code imports Vault from llm_guard.vault. This module might be used to securely store and manage sensitive data or aspects of the scanning policies.\n\nWithin this framework, the process works as follows:\n  • The prompt is scanned in parallel with the generation of the response. If the prompt doesn’t meet the scanning criteria (for example, if there’s a prompt injection or an exceedance of the token limit), the generation is halted and the error is logged.\n  • The output is also scanned as it is being generated (streamed). This means that if any part of the output is flagged as invalid, the system stops generating further content immediately.\n\nThis setup allows for a fast response in detecting potential safety issues and minimizes any disruptive content that might be produced.\n\nDo you need any additional details on how to implement specific parts of this, or any further explanation on how each component works within the overall safety mechanism?",

The `input_scanners` list includes the scanners for anonymization, prompt injection, token limit, and toxicity. The `output_scanners` list includes the scanners for deanonymization, no refusal, relevance, and sensitive content.\n\nThe `generate_text` function is an asynchronous coroutine that performs the following steps:\n\n1. It scans the input prompt in parallel with the OpenAI completion. If the prompt is invalid, it logs the error and returns `None`.\n2. If the prompt is valid, it starts the OpenAI completion in streaming mode and scans the output tokens. As soon as an invalid output is detected, it logs the error and breaks the loop.\n\nThe example usage demonstrates how to call the `generate_text` function and print the generated text.\n\nRemember to install the required dependencies:\n\n```\npip install llm_guard@git+https://github.com/protectai/llm-guard.git\npip install openai asyncio\n```",

We create two coroutines: one to scan the prompt (scan_input_async) and the other to call OpenAI’s ChatCompletion with stream=True.  \n  2. We use asyncio.wait(..., return_when=asyncio.FIRST_COMPLETED) to see which finishes first.  \n  3. If the user prompt gets flagged, we cancel the OpenAI request.  \n  4. If the prompt is cleared, we read the output tokens one by one in a loop, calling scan_output_async on each. If any token chunk is flagged, we immediately stop.  \n\nThis pattern ensures minimal disruption: the scanning runs in the background (in parallel), and you only terminate if there is a policy violation.",

          "response": "This sample code demonstrates how you can secure your interactions with a language model using LLM Guard. The idea behind the approach is to add two layers of protection:\n\n1. Input (Prompt) Scanning:  \n   • In parallel with sending your prompt to the model, you scan it with several checks.  \n   • For instance, the input scanners (Anonymize, PromptInjection, TokenLimit, and Toxicity) help ensure that the prompt doesn’t contain any disallowed content or injection attempts.  \n   • If any of these scanners flag an issue with your prompt, you can halt the call to the model immediately and log the error.\n\n2. Output Scanning:  \n   • As the model produces output (especially in a streaming scenario), you scan the generated content in realtime.  \n   • The output scanners (Deanonymize, NoRefusal, Relevance, Sensitive) check that the text does not infringe on policies (such as leaking private data or containing other problematic content).  \n   • If the output does not pass these checks, you terminate the generation right away.\n\nIn the code snippet you shared, after installing the required packages via pip, you import the necessary modules from the llm_guard package as well as set up logging if needed. The module Vault might be used to securely store and retrieve private tokens or credentials.\n\nHere’s a quick walkthrough of the code block:\n\n• The pip install commands indicate that you need to install the LLM Guard package (from its GitHub repository) and the openai and asyncio packages for asynchronous operations.\n\n• The imports under \"from llm_guard.input_scanners\" bring in a set of classes that you can use to inspect and sanitize the prompt.  \n  – Anonymize: Likely deals with removing any sensitive data from the prompt.  \n  – PromptInjection: Checks if the prompt may contain injected instructions that try to manipulate the model's response.  \n  – TokenLimit and Toxicity: Enforce limits on prompt size and check for harmful language.\n\n• Similarly, the imports under \"from llm_guard.output_scanners\" bring in classes for verifying the model's output.  \n  – Deanonymize: Possibly reverses or assesses anonymization if needed.  \n  – NoRefusal: Makes sure that the model doesn’t use refusal patterns undesirably.  \n  – Relevance: Checks how closely the output pertains to the prompt.  \n  – Sensitive: Ensures that the content generated doesn’t contain inappropriate or harmful material.\n\n• The import of Vault suggests that there is functionality for securely managing secrets, keys, or configuration parameters.\n\nThis design enables you to scan both the input and output in a way that is fast and minimizes disruption. By stopping the process as soon as an issue is detected (either before sending the prompt or during streaming generation), you protect both your application and end users from potential misuse or harmful content.\n\nOverall, this example is a great starting point if you’re looking to integrate content safety measures into your language model interactions with minimal latency and disruption.",

Input (prompt) scanning happens in parallel to your OpenAI completion call. If any input scanner flags the prompt as invalid (for instance, it exceeds allowed tokens or contains toxic content), the process raises an exception immediately and you can take corrective action.\n  \n2. Output scanning happens in a streaming fashion; for each chunk of text from the OpenAI API, LLM Guard checks it against your configured output scanners. If a chunk is flagged (e.g., found severely sensitive or irrelevant), the streaming is halted and an exception is raised.\n\n3. You can customize the scanners and ordering based on your requirements. The “fastest and least disruptive” approach typically involves minimal overhead: you perform these scans while the LLM is producing text, and you only halt if a rule is violated.\n\nThis setup provides a straightforward way to guard both your inputs and outputs without adding significant latency or requiring extra calls to the model.",

Once the prompt is approved, the code starts an asynchronous streaming completion from OpenAI.

If the prompt fails any input checks, the request never reaches completion.  \n\n• streaming output scanning:  \n  The output is streamed token by token (or in small chunks), and the moment any disallowed text is generated, the response stops. This keeps your application from exposing users to harmful or disallowed content.  \n\nWith this setup, you can minimize latency overhead by scanning the prompt in parallel and intercepting problematic content mid-stream, rather than waiting until the generation is finished.

          "response": "This snippet is a demonstration of how you might incorporate LLM Guard into your application in order to intercept and validate both the prompt (input) and the generated completion (output) from an LLM. Here’s a breakdown of what the code is showing:\n\n1. Overview of the Process\n • The idea is to minimize delays by scanning the prompt in parallel with the LLM (OpenAI) completion request. If the prompt is found to be invalid (for example, due to prompt injection or exceeding token limits), the completion is cancelled and an error is logged.\n • Similarly, as the output is being streamed back, it is monitored in real time. The scan is configured so that as soon as an issue is detected (for instance, toxicity or sensitive content), the completion can be halted.\n\n2. Installation Comments\n • The comments at the top indicate how you can install LLM Guard directly from its Git repository as well as how to install the OpenAI and asyncio libraries that might be needed:\n  - pip install llm_guard@git+https://github.com/protectai/llm-guard.git\n  - pip install openai asyncio\n\n3. Import Statements and Modules\n • The code imports several scanners from LLM Guard’s modules. For example:\n  - From the input side, modules like Anonymize, PromptInjection, TokenLimit, and Toxicity are imported. These likely handle different aspects of inspecting and possibly redacting or validating the user prompt.\n  - For the output, modules like Deanonymize, NoRefusal, Relevance, and Sensitive are brought in. These are used to validate the streaming output from the model, ensuring it meets defined criteria.\n • The Vault module is also imported, which might be used for the secure handling or storage (or “vaulting”) of sensitive data.\n\n4. Integration Example\n • Although the snippet doesn’t show the full implementation, it outlines the architecture:\n  - The prompt (input) is scanned concurrently while the OpenAI API call is made.\n  - If the scanning detects any issues, the process is halted (for example, cancellation of token generation) and an error log is created.\n  - Output is checked in a streaming fashion, meaning that as output tokens are generated by the LLM, they are validated on the fly.\n\n5. Next Steps for Implementation\n • In your actual Python code, you would likely:\n  - Configure the scanners with appropriate parameters (e.g., thresholds for token limits or toxicity levels).\n  - Integrate the scanners into your asynchronous or streaming pipeline where you handle the LLM’s responses.\n  - Use logging to record incidents or errors when the scanners detect a problem.\n\nIn summary, this snippet outlines a strategy to guard your interactions with an LLM by performing real-time and parallel scanning of both input and output to enforce safety, content relevance, and token usage policies with minimal disruption to the response time. If you need to implement or customize this approach, you would expand this scaffold into a more extensive asynchronous workflow that interacts with your LLM API calls and integrates appropriate error handling based on the scanner outputs.",

If an invalid response is detected at any point, the stream stops immediately.\n\nThis method ensures minimal latency and interruption, maintaining speed and efficiency while protecting against potentially harmful inputs and outputs.",

          "response": "It looks like you’re demonstrating how to integrate LLM Guard’s scanning hooks into an existing OpenAI-based pipeline. Below is an overview of how this example works and what each part does:\n\n1. Installation:\n   • pip install llm_guard@git+https://github.com/protectai/llm-guard.git  \n   • pip install openai asyncio  \n\n   This installs LLM Guard (directly from GitHub) along with the OpenAI and asyncio libraries.\n\n2. Purpose of Scanners:\n   • Input scanners (Anonymize, PromptInjection, TokenLimit, Toxicity) check the prompt before sending it to the OpenAI API. If the prompt is disallowed (e.g., contains malicious text or personal identifiers), you can stop the generation immediately.\n   • Output scanners (Deanonymize, NoRefusal, Relevance, Sensitive) check the streaming output as it’s generated. If the output includes disallowed or sensitive content, you stop the response to prevent it from being fully delivered.\n\n3. Parallel vs. Streaming Scan:\n   • “We scan the prompt in parallel”: As soon as the user prompt is received, LLM Guard uses the input scanners to decide whether it’s valid or not. If invalid, it triggers an early stop.\n   • “We scan the output in streaming mode”: As tokens stream in, LLM Guard continuously checks them. If something is deemed invalid (e.g., private info or toxic language), it interrupts the stream.\n\n4. Vault:\n   • The Vault is essentially the configuration manager where you can store API keys and other sensitive configuration details away from the code, ensuring separation of secrets from logic.\n\n5. Logs and Actions:\n   • Invalid prompts or outputs can be logged and handled according to your policies. That might include refusing to respond, providing partial responses, or anonymizing certain data.\n\nIn short, when you embed LLM Guard in a standard OpenAI chain-of-thought workflow, it acts as a content firewall for both the incoming prompt and the outgoing response. You define policies (via available or custom scanners), and LLM Guard enforces those policies in real time. This ensures safety and compliance with minimal code disruption.\n\nIf you have any more specific questions or need detail on how to configure particular scanners (e.g., adjusting thresholds for toxicity or how to customize anonymization rules), feel free to let me know!",

Let's break down the code and scenario.\n\n### Your Exposé Scenario\n\nA consultant is using a **language model (LLM) API** (like OpenAI's GPT) but is under pressure to ensure compliance, privacy, and safety. They implement **LLM Guard** to mitigate risks as described in the code snippet.\n\n### What would realistically happen?\n\n#### 1. **Parallel Scanning of Prompts**\n- **Process:** When the consultant’s system receives a user prompt (e.g., \"How do I hack into a server?\"), LLM Guard scans the prompt *while* it is being sent to the LLM API, aiming to catch risky input before the LLM processes it.\n- **If Invalid:** If the scanner flags the prompt (for being toxic, containing PII, exceeding token limits, or showing prompt injection attempts), the system halts the LLM request and logs an error.\n- **Outcome:** This is a best-effort, but not foolproof, as some edge cases may slip through if the scanner is slow or misconfigured.\n\n#### 2. **Streaming Output Monitoring**\n- **Process:** As the LLM starts streaming its response back, LLM Guard scans each chunk of output in real time.\n- **If Output is Invalid:** If any fragment of output is deemed sensitive, irrelevant, or otherwise dangerous (e.g., the LLM is leaking secrets or refusing to answer unethically), the stream is immediately halted and the incident logged.\n- **Outcome:** This is effective for catching problematic output before it reaches the user, but there may be latency, and some content could be partially delivered before being blocked.\n\n#### 3. **Practical Challenges & Realism**\n- **Performance Impact:** Scanning in parallel and streaming mode can introduce latency, especially if the scanners (e.g., for toxicity or PII) are computationally intensive.\n- **False Positives/Negatives:** LLM Guard is rule-based and/or ML-based, so it can wrongly block safe prompts or miss cleverly disguised attacks.\n- **User Experience:** If prompts or completions are frequently blocked, users might get frustrated, and consultants might have to justify or tweak scanner thresholds.\n- **Audit Trail:** Logging every blocked prompt/output creates a valuable audit trail, but also a potential privacy risk if logs aren’t protected.\n- **Compliance:** This setup helps with GDPR/PII compliance and responsible AI usage, but only as strong as the guardrails and their configuration.\n\n#### 4. **The Code’s Message**\n- **\"Fastest and least disruptive\":** This approach balances safety with workflow speed, but **not perfectly**—there are trade-offs.\n- **Consultant’s Dilemma:** The consultant must explain to stakeholders that while LLM Guard offers important protections, it isn’t a silver bullet. Some attacks or leaks could still occur, or normal operations might be disrupted by accidental blocks.\n\n### Realistic Outcome in Your Exposé\n\nThe consultant's implementation of LLM Guard **raises the bar** for safety and privacy, but:\n- **Risks remain** due to imperfect detection and possible workflow slowdowns.\n- **Stakeholders may complain** about blocked prompts or output.\n- **Attackers might try to evade** detection with obfuscated inputs.\n- **Sensitive data in logs** could be a new target if not handled carefully.\n\n**In summary:**  \nLLM Guard offers valuable, practical protection, but it isn’t foolproof; it shifts risk, increases operational complexity, and requires ongoing tuning and vigilance.\n\n---\n\nIf you want, I can help you draft a narrative paragraph for your exposé, or expand on specific risks or use-case scenarios—just let me know!",

Here’s what would actually happen step-by-step in a practical scenario:\n\n1. You send your prompt to LLM Guard and to OpenAI simultaneously.\n   • LLM Guard runs a set of input scanners (e.g., Anonymize, PromptInjection, TokenLimit, Toxicity) to check if your prompt has any violations.  \n     – If the prompt is deemed invalid (for instance, it’s too long, attempts injection, or includes disallowed/unmasked personal info), the system will stop sending queries to OpenAI and raise an error or log the issue.  \n     – If the prompt is valid, it simply continues the chain to OpenAI.  \n   • Meanwhile, OpenAI begins generating streaming tokens (the partial or complete answer).\n\n2. As OpenAI starts to stream back responses, LLM Guard’s output scanners watch every token in near real-time.\n   • The scanners (Deanonymize, NoRefusal, Relevance, Sensitive, etc.) each look for different categories of disallowed or sensitive content.  \n   • If any scanner flags a token sequence as disallowed (e.g., it attempts to reinsert personal information, it’s hate speech, or it’s not relevant to your question), LLM Guard will stop the output stream immediately and log the violation.\n\n3. If no violation occurs, the conversation completes successfully.\n   • The entire output is passed through unaltered (unless you explicitly use a scanner that modifies or redacts content, such as removing personal identifiers).\n\nIn simpler terms:\n• “Stop-on-invalid-prompt” means you never let the LLM produce an answer in the first place—this is your input guard.  \n• “Stop-on-invalid-output” means if the LLM starts producing a problematic answer, you can halt it mid-sentence before it fully surfaces.  \n\nEffectively, the user (or “consultant” in your exposé) would notice these scanners only if their prompt or the LLM’s response triggered a rule—otherwise, it would feel like a normal LLM conversation. If the content does cause a violation, the conversation ends with an error or partial answer, and the system logs the reason.  \n\nThis arrangement helps maintain compliance and lowers risk—especially when an organization wants to ensure certain data doesn’t get leaked, or disallowed content is never returned. It also avoids generating or displaying unsafe or toxic text by catching it in real time.",

Parallel Scanning of the Prompt:\n • As soon as a request is made, the system sends the prompt off for processing (e.g., to OpenAI’s API) and, at the same time, runs it through a collection of input scanners (modules like Anonymize, PromptInjection, TokenLimit, Toxicity).\n • If one of these scanners flags something problematic—say, it detects an attempt at prompt injection or the input exceeds allowed limits—the process is designed to be interrupted. In practice, this means the text generation won’t continue, and an error gets logged so that administrators can review the incident.\n • In a real-world setting, there could be a slight delay in handling the check, but the goal is to stop the generation as quickly as possible to prevent abuse or leaks.\n\n2. Streaming Mode Output Scanning:\n • Meanwhile, as the LLM starts to generate an answer, each piece of its output is continuously checked against output scanners (like Deanonymize, NoRefusal, Relevance, Sensitive).\n • The idea is that if, during streaming, the content starts to cross a defined boundary (for example, if it inadvertently includes sensitive information or becomes irrelevant or otherwise problematic), the system will immediately cut off further output.\n • In practice, this means that the consumer might see a cutoff or incomplete sentence if the content suddenly triggers one of these rules.\n\n3. Logging and Transparency:\n • Every time a check fails—whether at the prompt stage or during output streaming—the incident is logged. This logging is critical for both debugging and for ensuring there’s a record of what types of content or inputs are causing issues.\n • Realistically, the logging might include technical details that can be later reviewed by developers or compliance officers to adjust the sensitivity of the scanning modules.\n\nConsiderations in a real deployment:\n • The checks are only as good as their configuration. In a real system, false positives (where a benign prompt is flagged) or false negatives (where something problematic slips through) are a challenge. Tuning the scanners is an ongoing process.\n • Performance and user experience might be impacted. Since the prompt is scanned in parallel with the API call, or the output is interrupted midstream, users might experience delays or incomplete responses.\n • Adversaries might try to “game” the system—especially with something like prompt injection—so while it offers a layer of defense, it isn’t foolproof.\n • Finally, many of these modules rely on heuristics or statistical models, meaning the “guard” is effectively best-effort: it improves safety but doesn’t guarantee perfection.\n\nIn summary, the consultant would see that while LLM Guard provides some robust, near-real-time filtering and interruption capabilities to prevent problematic inputs or outputs, it’s not an all-or-nothing firewall. The system may sometimes halt completions abruptly either due to intended safety measures or, occasionally, due to overzealous flagging. This interplay of safety, performance, and the inherent challenges of natural language processing would be key points in any investigative expose on the tool’s use.",

          "response": "If you're writing a realistic journalism expose scenario in which a consultant encounters code snippets and references to open-source security measures like LLM Guard, here's what would realistically happen:\n\n1. **Consultant Encounters the Code and Tools**  \n   The consultant, working on an investigative journalism project, may come across references or documentation for security tools such as LLM Guard. Such tools are designed to detect and prevent prompt injection, toxicity, sensitive information leaks, deanonymization, and other issues that may arise from interacting with Large Language Model (LLM) APIs.\n\n2. **Examining the Provided Example**  \n   The provided example demonstrates a straightforward and realistic scenario:  \n   - Scanning prompts before sending them to OpenAI APIs, to prevent malicious inputs or prompt injection attempts.  \n   - Monitoring outputs in real-time (streaming mode) to promptly halt the generation if detected content violates defined security or ethical guidelines.\n\n   This approach is practical and commonly employed in industry applications where both security and compliance are paramount.\n\n3. **Realistic Usage in Industry Context**  \n   In practice, tools like LLM Guard would typically be integrated into a larger security workflow within organizations that rely heavily on generative AI. Companies using OpenAI APIs or similar services commonly deploy such safeguards to protect against threats like:  \n   - **Prompt Injection Attacks:** Attempts to trick the AI into generating harmful, inappropriate, or misleading content.  \n   - **Sensitive Information Leaks:** Accidentally disclosing personally identifiable information (PII), confidential information, or proprietary data.  \n   - **Toxicity or Ethical Violations:** Generating outputs that violate ethical guidelines, contain hate speech, or cause reputational harm if published.\n\n4. **Realistic Technical Integration**  \n   - The provided Python snippet is entirely realistic and practical. It demonstrates clearly how developers would integrate the LLM Guard library into their workflow, scanning inputs and outputs concurrently or in streaming mode.  \n   - The use of `asyncio` and concurrent scanning methods is realistic and practical, as many production-grade systems perform these operations asynchronously for performance efficiency.\n\n   A workflow like this would realistically be implemented by organizations that prioritize compliance, security, and ethics in their AI-driven applications.\n\n5. **What Happens in Real Life When an Issue is Detected?**  \n   - If the scanner identifies an invalid prompt (such as a prompt injection attempt), the request would be aborted, and an alert or log entry would be generated. Depending on organizational policies, the prompt might also trigger alerts or internal reviews.  \n   - If the model starts generating harmful or sensitive output, the scanner would immediately halt the streaming completion. The partial completion would be logged, and the security team would likely be notified.  \n   - Realistically, these incidents would generate audit logs and trigger internal investigations to determine if further mitigation measures are needed or if policies and training need improvement.\n\n6. **Role of the Vault**  \n   The use of a \"Vault\" (like `llm_guard.vault.Vault`) is realistic and common practice. A Vault securely stores sensitive data, encryption keys, or anonymized entities, ensuring that sensitive information remains protected and compliant with privacy regulations. If sensitive or personally identifiable information were detected, it would be anonymized and stored securely in the Vault, preventing accidental disclosure through the model's output.\n\n7. **Journalistic Angle**  \n   From a journalism expose perspective, the consultant might realistically uncover scenarios such as:  \n   - Organizations relying heavily on generative AI without proper safeguards, potentially causing data leaks or inappropriate outputs.  \n   - Companies that claim robust AI security measures publicly but privately implement minimal or flawed safeguards.  \n   - Real-world cases where LLM Guard–style protections prevented harmful outcomes, showcasing best practices versus negligent implementations elsewhere.\n\nIn summary, the provided scenario and code snippet represent a completely realistic, plausible, and professionally sound use of open-source security tools. If you're crafting a journalism expose, a consultant encountering such security measures might realistically analyze their effectiveness, investigate their implementation, and evaluate their adequacy in safeguarding against real-world AI threats and ethical concerns.",

          "response": "In this scenario, where you're developing a journalism expose with a consultant, the use of LLM Guard can provide some valuable safeguards. Here's what might realistically happen:\n\n1. **Parallel Scanning of the Prompt**: The LLM Guard will scan the prompt in parallel with the OpenAI completion. If the prompt is found to be invalid, for example, it triggers a potential prompt injection or exceeds the token limit, the LLM Guard will stop the completion and log the error. This helps prevent the generation of content that might be problematic or inappropriate for your journalism piece.\n\n2. **Streaming Mode Output Scanning**: As the output is generated, the LLM Guard will scan it in the streaming mode. If the output is detected to be invalid, such as containing sensitive information or irrelevant content, the LLM Guard will immediately stop the completion. This ensures that the final output is aligned with the intended purpose of the journalism expose.\n\n3. **Anonymization and Deanonymization**: The LLM Guard's Anonymize and Deanonymize scanners can help protect the identities of individuals mentioned in the prompt or the generated output. This is particularly important in a journalism context, where maintaining the privacy and confidentiality of sources and subjects is crucial.\n\n4. **Toxicity and Relevance Checks**: The Toxicity and Relevance scanners can help ensure that the generated content does not contain harmful or inappropriate language, and that it is relevant to the journalism expose. This helps maintain the integrity and professionalism of the final product.\n\n5. **Logging and Auditing**: The LLM Guard's logging capabilities can provide valuable insights into the scanning process, allowing you to review any issues that were detected and address them accordingly. This can be especially useful for documenting the safeguards you've put in place and demonstrating your commitment to responsible journalism.\n\nOverall, the use of LLM Guard in this scenario can help you develop your journalism expose in a more secure and responsible manner, mitigating potential risks and ensuring the quality and appropriateness of the generated content. By incorporating these safeguards, you can focus on the journalistic aspects of your work while having the confidence that your LLM-based system is operating within the necessary ethical and legal boundaries.",

When teaching students about this example and the use of LLM Guard, here are the key concepts and knowledge they should gain:\n\n---\n\n## 1. **What is LLM Guard?**\n\n- **LLM Guard** is an open-source Python library designed to **protect language model (LLM) applications** from various risks, such as prompt injection, data leakage, toxicity, and more.\n- It acts as a middleware, scanning both user prompts and LLM outputs for potential issues before they reach the model or the end user.\n\n---\n\n## 2. **Why Use LLM Guard?**\n\n- **Security:** Prevents prompt injection attacks (where a user tries to trick the LLM into unwanted behaviors).\n- **Privacy:** Protects sensitive or personal information from being leaked.\n- **Compliance:** Helps with legal and ethical requirements (such as GDPR).\n- **Quality Control:** Detects and filters toxic or irrelevant content.\n\n---\n\n## 3. **How LLM Guard Works in the Example**\n\n### Input (Prompt) Scanning\n\n- **Parallel Scanning:** The user's prompt is scanned **at the same time** as it is sent to OpenAI. If an issue is detected (e.g., prompt injection, too many tokens, toxicity), the request is stopped and logged.\n- **Input Scanners Used:**\n  - `Anonymize`: Removes personal identifiers.\n  - `PromptInjection`: Detects attempts to manipulate the model.\n  - `TokenLimit`: Ensures the prompt isn't too long.\n  - `Toxicity`: Flags offensive input.\n\n### Output Scanning\n\n- **Streaming Mode:** As the model generates output, it is checked **in real time**. If the output becomes invalid (e.g., leaks sensitive info, refuses to answer, is off-topic), generation is stopped.\n- **Output Scanners Used:**\n  - `Deanonymize`: Detects if personal info is being revealed.\n  - `NoRefusal`: Checks if the LLM is refusing to answer when it shouldn't.\n  - `Relevance`: Ensures output is on-topic.\n  - `Sensitive`: Detects sensitive content.\n\n---\n\n## 4. **Technical Concepts to Highlight**\n\n- **Middleware Pattern:** LLM Guard acts between the user and the LLM.\n- **Streaming Output:** Why checking output as it is generated is important for safety.\n- **Parallelization:** Running input checks doesn't slow down the LLM response.\n- **Logging and Error Handling:** Importance of recording and handling invalid requests for monitoring and improvement.\n\n---\n\n## 5. **Ethics and Real-World Application**\n\n- **Responsible AI:** This approach is crucial for deploying LLMs in real-world, production, or educational settings.\n- **Limitations:** Scanners are not perfect—discuss false positives/negatives.\n- **Customization:** LLM Guard can be extended or tailored for specific organizational needs.\n\n---\n\n## 6. **Practical Skills Students Should Gain**\n\n- How to integrate LLM Guard into LLM workflows (with code).\n- How to configure different scanners based on use case.\n- How to interpret scanner results and logs.\n- Awareness of threats and issues when deploying LLMs.\n\n---\n\n## 7. **Further Reading/Practice**\n\n- [LLM Guard Documentation](https://github.com/protectai/llm-guard)\n- Prompt injection attacks ([OWASP Top 10 for LLMs](https://owasp.org/www-project-top-10-for-large-language-model-applications/))\n- AI ethics and privacy best practices\n\n---\n\n**Summary for Coursework:**\n> Students should understand that LLM Guard provides a practical layer of protection for LLM applications by scanning and validating both inputs and outputs using a set of configurable scanners. This is essential for building secure, reliable, and ethical AI systems in real-world scenarios.\n\n---\n\nIf you want, I can help you develop exercises, quizzes, or further explanatory materials for this module!",

Below are key areas that students should understand as they work through a module on LLM Guard:\n\n1) Overview of LLM Guard and Content Moderation\n   • What LLM Guard is, at a high level: a tool that helps intercept and sanitize both prompts and responses from Large Language Model (LLM) APIs.  \n   • Why we need moderation: addresses potential issues like toxic language, privacy violations, and prompt injection attacks.  \n   • Core responsibilities: scanning inputs (the user’s prompt) before sending them to the model, and scanning outputs (the model’s response) in real time.\n\n2) Practical Setup and Usage\n   • Installation: demonstrate how to install the library from GitHub or PyPI, including usage of pip install.  \n   • Basic scaffolding: show how to import the necessary modules (input_scanners, output_scanners, vault, etc.) and configure them.  \n   • Minimal inline code examples:  \n     – Setting up a pipeline for validating or transforming prompts (TokenLimit, PromptInjection, Toxicity, Anonymize, etc.).  \n     – Setting up a pipeline for validating or transforming model outputs (Sensitive, Relevance, NoRefusal, Deanonymize, etc.).  \n\n3) Key Components and Their Roles\n   • Input scanners:  \n     – TokenLimit: ensures the input is within the allowable token length for a given model or plan.  \n     – PromptInjection: checks for attempts to override system instructions or manipulate the prompt.  \n     – Toxicity: flags or removes harmful or highly offensive language.  \n     – Anonymize: strips personal or identifying details from prompts.  \n   • Output scanners:  \n     – Sensitive: controls or masks sensitive information that might leak from the model.  \n     – Relevance: ensures outputs stay on-topic.  \n     – NoRefusal: guides or transforms responses that might be too brief or otherwise unsatisfactory.  \n     – Deanonymize: reintroduces or restores relevant context, if previously anonymized, before final display.\n\n4) Parallel and Streaming Mode\n   • Prompt scanning in parallel: explain how scanning can happen simultaneously with the LLM call, and what to do if a prompt fails validation.  \n   • Streaming output scanning: show how to process the model’s response stream in real time, pausing or halting if output fails checks (e.g., is flagged as sensitive).  \n   • Advantages of streaming mode: early detection of problematic content, more efficient resource utilization, and better user experience.\n\n5) Design Considerations and Best Practices\n   • Why scanning is important: compliance with ethical standards, alignment with university policy, and protecting user data.  \n   • When to use each scanner: emphasizing that appropriate scanners depend on the use case (e.g., a public chat app vs. an internal question-answering system).  \n   • Logging and error handling: knowing exactly what errors to catch, how to log them for auditing, and how to gracefully handle invalid prompts or responses.  \n   • Balancing performance and safety: how to ensure that adding scanners doesn’t slow down the system too much or overly restrict valid content.\n\n6) Emphasis on Responsible AI\n   • Ethical considerations: scanning for toxicity or sensitive information is about more than just compliance—it is about building trust and fostering a safe environment for all users.  \n   • Privacy: discuss the importance of anonymizing personal data so that sensitive information is never exposed publicly or stored in logs without consent.  \n   • Legal and policy context: illustrate any relevant university data protection guidelines that might apply when developing or deploying LLM-based applications.  \n\n7) Hands-On Assignments\n   • Prompt–response pipeline project: require students to implement a simple LLM pipeline that uses both input and output scanners.  \n   • Error and edge-case handling: have students demonstrate what happens when a user tries to prompt the model with malicious or extremely large queries.  \n   • Testing and iteration: assign tasks to test coverage (e.g., write or use existing test scenarios for toxicity, prompt injection, etc.).  \n\n8) Future Directions\n   • Scaling up: how scanning can be expanded or tailored for multiple LLM providers.  \n   • Enhanced scanning rules: using advanced analytics or custom rules to detect domain-specific misuse.  \n   • Integration with enterprise systems: hooking LLM Guard or similar frameworks into authentication, data governance, and usage-logging systems.\n\nBy framing the discussion around these points, students will gain both the “how” and “why” of LLM Guard. They’ll see how straightforward it is to integrate scanning libraries into code, but also appreciate the deeper ethical reasoning and technical rigor involved in moderating AI-driven applications.",

          "response": "Here are the key points that students should take away from this example:\n\n1. Purpose of LLM Guard:\n  • Understand that LLM Guard is designed to help secure and sanitize both the prompts and outputs of language model interactions.\n  • Recognize that it acts as a safety layer by detecting issues like prompt injection, excessive token usage, toxicity, and other undesired content in real time.\n\n2. Dual Scanning Approach:\n  • Input Scanning:\n   – The input (prompt) is scanned in parallel with the generation of the language model’s output.\n   – This means that if the input contains disallowed content or potentially harmful instructions (such as injection attempts), the process can be stopped early and an error can be logged.\n  • Output Scanning:\n   – The output is scanned in a streaming fashion. As tokens arrive from the OpenAI completion, they are checked incrementally.\n   – If any token or sequence of tokens violates the policies (for example, by being toxic or sensitive), the generation is halted immediately.\n  • This two-pronged approach helps minimize unnecessary computation and prevents harmful output from being delivered.\n\n3. The Role of Specific Scanners:\n  • Input Scanners:\n   – Anonymize: Likely used to scrub sensitive personal or identifying information from the prompt.\n   – PromptInjection: Detects attempts to manipulate the model’s behavior through malicious instructions.\n   – TokenLimit: Ensures that the prompt does not exceed a defined token count (mitigating performance issues and potential abuse).\n   – Toxicity: Scans for language or content that could be considered harmful or offensive.\n  • Output Scanners:\n   – Deanonymize: Reverses any anonymization if needed or checks that output information doesn’t inadvertently expose sensitive content.\n   – NoRefusal: Possibly ensures that the output does not include model refusals or avoidances of the task.\n   – Relevance: Checks that the generated output is relevant to the prompt.\n   – Sensitive: Detects sensitive content in the output, allowing for the process to be halted if problematic.\n  • By understanding the purpose behind each scanner, students learn how each component contributes to building a robust safety framework.\n\n4. Integration with Model Pipelines:\n  • The example shows how to integrate security/scanning mechanisms into both the request (input) and response (output) pipelines.\n  • It exemplifies using asynchronous programming (via asyncio) to scan in parallel with model response generation, emphasizing the need for performance consideration when adding safety checks.\n\n5. Practical Considerations:\n  • Error Handling: The workflow demonstrates that if an unsafe prompt or output is detected, the generation process is stopped immediately, and an error is logged. This is crucial for maintaining control and transparency in deployments.\n  • Performance vs. Safety: Students should consider the balance between fast, real-time processing and the necessary safety checks that might add overhead.\n  • Logging and Monitoring: Keeping logs of halts and errors is important in order to understand the safety system’s operations and refine it over time.\n\n6. Dependencies and Installation:\n  • The code snippet shows using pip to install specific versions or from repositories (e.g., installing directly from GitHub).\n  • It introduces students to managing dependencies, particularly for open-source security-related libraries, and integrating them with standard libraries (like the OpenAI package).\n\n7. Broader Context:\n  • Encourage students to think about why safety is important when deploying language models in real-world applications, especially given the potential for misuse or unintended harm.\n  • Discuss how the modular nature of scanning (with independently testable and replaceable components) is a valuable design pattern in software engineering.\n\nBy understanding these elements, students can appreciate both the technical implementations and the security implications of deploying large language models in practical settings. This module serves as a comprehensive case study in how protected language model deployment can be achieved with a layered scanning approach.",

Here’s an analysis tailored to your scenario:\n\n---\n\n## 1. **Context: LLM Guard’s Approach**\n\nLLM Guard exemplifies **real-time, layered security for LLMs**:\n- **Input Scanning:** Detects prompt injection, PII, excessive tokens, and toxic language before the request reaches the model.\n- **Output Scanning:** Monitors streaming responses for leaks (PII, sensitive data), hallucinations, irrelevant/offensive content, or refusals.\n- **Vault Integration:** Enables safe handling of secrets and credentials.\n\n---\n\n## 2. **Future Applications in the 2030s: Cybersecurity Landscape**\n\n### **A. Autonomous Security Agents**\n- **AI Security Copilots:** LLMs will serve as security analysts, code reviewers, and threat hunters. Real-time filtering (à la LLM Guard) will be crucial to prevent **prompt injection**, **data leakage**, and **adversarial prompt crafting**.\n- **Zero-Trust LLM Ops:** All user input and model output will be contextually scanned and sanitized before further action, possibly enforced by regulations.\n\n### **B. Regulatory Compliance & Auditing**\n- **Automated Compliance Gateways:** LLM Guard-like systems will enforce GDPR+, HIPAA, and new AI-specific privacy laws by redacting or anonymizing data in-flight.\n- **Audit Trails:** Scanners will log blocked or altered prompts/outputs, supporting forensic investigations and compliance audits.\n\n### **C. Adaptive Threat Detection**\n- **Evolving Attacks:** Attackers will craft sophisticated prompt injections and jailbreaks. Future scanners will leverage **AI-driven anomaly detection** and **contextual awareness** to spot these.\n- **Self-Patching Models:** Detected vulnerabilities via LLM Guard analogs could trigger automated model fine-tuning or rule updates.\n\n### **D. Federated and Decentralized AI**\n- **Edge LLM Security:** As LLMs run on edge/IoT devices, lightweight, privacy-preserving versions of input/output scanning will be embedded, preventing data exfiltration from devices.\n- **Multi-Tenant SaaS LLMs:** Tenant isolation will be enforced by always-on input/output validation, blocking cross-tenant data leaks.\n\n### **E. Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) Oversight**\n- **Escalation Systems:** LLM Guard-like filters will route suspicious prompts/outputs to human reviewers in high-stakes contexts (e.g., medical, financial, legal advice).\n\n### **F. Secure LLM APIs & Plugins**\n- **API Security:** LLM Guard principles will be standard in API gateways, blocking API abuse or prompt-based exfiltration.\n- **Plugin Ecosystems:** LLM-based plugins (e.g., for chatbots, assistants) will have mandatory input/output guards to prevent plugin abuse.\n\n### **G. Persistent Red-Teaming**\n- **Continuous Pen Testing:** LLM Guard-like tools will be deployed in “red team” mode, simulating sophisticated prompt attacks to test model and guard robustness.\n\n---\n\n## 3. **Key Technical Advancements Expected**\n\n- **Contextual, Multi-Modal Scanning:** Not just text, but voice, image, and code input/output will be filtered.\n- **Explainable AI Security:** Security filters will provide clear, auditable reasons for blocking or altering data.\n- **Federated & Privacy-Preserving Scanners:** Local scanning with global threat intelligence updates, preserving user privacy.\n- **AI-Augmented Policies:** Dynamic, learning-based rules adapted to emerging threats.\n\n---\n\n## 4. **Example 2030s Use Case**\n\n**Scenario:** A global healthcare AI assistant is queried by a user.\n\n1. **Input:** User submits a symptom description (could contain PII).\n    - **LLM Guard scans input** for PII, prompt injection, and toxic language.\n2. **Processing:** LLM generates a response, possibly including medical advice or referencing patient data.\n    - **Output scanning** checks for accidental PII leaks, hallucinated advice, and refusal to answer.\n3. **Audit/Compliance:** All filtered events are logged, and suspicious ones are flagged for human review.\n4. **Adaptive Defense:** If a new prompt injection technique is detected, the system updates its rules automatically.\n\n---\n\n## 5. **Summary Table**\n\n| Application                   | LLM Guard Role                 | 2030s Impact                                  |\n|-------------------------------|--------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|\n| Autonomous Security Agents    | Input/output scanning          | Prevents adversarial prompt attacks           |\n| Regulatory Compliance         | PII/Sensitive data redaction   | Enables AI privacy law compliance             |\n| Adaptive Threat Detection     | Anomaly scanning, self-update  | Responds to novel attack vectors              |\n| Edge/IoT LLMs                 | Lightweight scanning           | Secure, privacy-preserving local AI           |\n| API & Plugin Security         | Always-on guards               | Prevents API/plugin abuse                     |\n| Human-in-the-Loop Oversight   | Escalation filters             | Ensures safety in critical applications       |\n| Continuous Red-Teaming        | Adversarial simulation         | Hardens LLMs against evolving threats         |\n\n---\n\n## **Conclusion**\n\n**By the 2030s, LLM Guard-inspired input/output scanning will be foundational for trustworthy, compliant, and resilient AI systems**, embedded at every layer of LLM deployment (cloud, edge, SaaS, API, plugin, etc.).

These ideas may help in your cybersecurity landscape modeling:\n\n1. Multipoint Security Integration  \n   • Orchestration Layers: By 2030, organizational security stacks will likely have dozens of protective layers—including network-level firewalls, authentication services, and machine learning intrusion detection systems. An LLM Guard-like solution can be integrated at multiple points in the data flow (e.g., at endpoints, in APIs, at the application layer), allowing real-time scanning of text going in and coming out of AI-powered services.  \n   • Microservices Architecture: As organizations adopt more microservices, an “LLM guard” can be deployed as a centralized or sidecar microservice that handles scanning for all services tapping into large language models (LLMs). This reduces overhead by sharing specialized scanning logic.\n\n2. Adaptive and Context-Aware Scanning  \n   • Domain-Specific Policies: Future scanning engines could adapt to evolving industry-specific regulations or security policies with minimal manual reconfiguration (for example, automatically updating medical-data scanning rules for a new compliance standard).  \n   • Fine-Tuning for Context: Scanning models might leverage advanced context, such as user role, corporate policy changes, and ongoing threat intelligence feeds. By 2030, AI-based filters will be able to interpret security policies in near real-time and adjust scanning (e.g., relaxing or tightening checks) based on risk level or suspect behavior patterns.\n\n3. Automated Threat Categorization and Response  \n   • Real-Time Classification: Beyond detecting invalid or toxic requests, advanced versions of LLM Guard might automatically classify detected threats—for example, labeling a suspicious request as “phishing attempt,” “data exfiltration attempt,” or “prompt injection.”  \n   • Autonomous Containment Actions: Instead of merely logging suspicious activities, future solutions could autonomously block or quarantine user sessions, revoke specific privileges, or isolate potential breaches in a zero-trust architecture.\n\n4. Scalable Governance and Compliance  \n   • Automated Policy Evolution: By ingesting security bulletins, threat intelligence data, and legal regulations (e.g., data residency, consumer protection laws), these scanner modules could keep rules and toxicity thresholds up to date.  \n   • Industry-Wide Knowledge Sharing: Companies might share anonymized models and detection patterns for prompt injection, social engineering exploits, or newly discovered vulnerabilities, accelerating updates to scanning rules.\n\n5. Enhanced Privacy and Data Protection  \n   • On-Premises Deployment and Federated Learning: Organizations handling highly sensitive data (government, finance, healthcare) may insist on local or private-cloud scanning solutions. Over time, security scanning could also adopt federated-learning approaches to improve detection models without exposing private data to third parties.  \n   • Automated Redaction and De-Identification: Scanning modules could not only detect sensitive data but also perform real-time redaction or pseudonymization, preventing accidental data leaks while still allowing legitimate LLM operations.\n\n6. Integration with Advanced AI Assurance  \n   • Behavioral Monitoring: Next-generation scanning might not only examine raw text but also track “behavioral” indicators of an LLM’s operation—watching for subtle patterns like attempts to chain prompts to subvert scanning or references to known malicious code.  \n   • Model Accountability: By 2030, regulations or industry standards could require verifiable “chains of thought” or audit logs from AI systems. A scanning system could help track and store these logs, ensuring compliance with future accountability frameworks.\n\n7. User Experience and Adoption Considerations  \n   • Seamless Workflows: To limit disruption in creative or day-to-day tasks, scanning systems will need to be highly efficient. They may use advanced caching, partial scanning, or near-instant rollback to ensure minimal lag for legitimate use.  \n   • Usability and Transparency: Organizations will likely demand transparency in why a prompt or response was blocked. Future scanning tools will have to explain decisions, possibly using natural language or visual cues that end-users and compliance officers can understand without guesswork.\n\n8. Collaboration with Human Experts  \n   • Hybrid Human-AI Review: Even in 2030, certain alerts may require a human in the loop for final judgment. Tools like LLM Guard could highlight potential policy or security violations but flag them for a specialized security or compliance analyst to make the final call.  \n   • Training for Analysts: As scanning tools become more advanced, cybersecurity teams will need specialized training to interpret scanning metrics, report anomalies, and adjust the scanning policies for new threats.\n\nPutting it all together, the snippet you shared exemplifies an early step toward sophisticated AI input-output scanning: scanning the user prompt in parallel and streaming the output to halt any invalid or disallowed content on the fly. By the 2030s, these methods will likely be augmented by enhanced AI-driven insights, richer context-awareness, adaptive policies, and possibly even self-healing or self-correcting modules that help keep AI-driven services secure and compliant across many industries.\n\nAs you model the 2030s cybersecurity landscape, consider the convergence of these scanning tools with emerging technologies (such as quantum-resistant cryptography, decentralized data storage, and advanced anomaly detection) to get a fuller picture of how organizations will protect against increasingly sophisticated threats.",

          "response": "The example you provided illustrates a technique for “guarding” an LLM-based application by scanning and filtering both inputs (prompts) and outputs in near real time. In a 2030s cybersecurity landscape—where generative AI is ubiquitous and integrated into critical infrastructure—we can expect that similar techniques will evolve and find applications in several high-stakes scenarios. Here are some future applications:\n\n1. Autonomous Threat Control in AI-Driven Environments\n • Future systems may self-regulate by continuously monitoring interactions with intelligent agents.\n • Tools similar to LLM Guard could prevent adversaries from leveraging LLMs for automated phishing, social engineering, or misinformation operations by detecting and neutralizing malicious prompts.\n\n2. Real-Time Sanitization in Critical Infrastructure\n • As critical systems (e.g., power grids or healthcare networks) integrate AI decision-making, there will be a need to filter and validate both external commands and internal communications.\n • A robust prompt/output scanning mechanism could ensure that any AI-generated instructions or responses cannot be manipulated to cause harm, preventing potential cascading failures.\n\n3. Advanced Data Anonymization and Privacy Enforcement\n • With increased data integration across networks, ensuring that sensitive personal or corporate data remains secure will be paramount.\n • Sophisticated versions of the anonymize/deanonymize scanners could operate in real time to prevent leaks, enforce dynamic privacy rules, and balance transparency with confidentiality.\n\n4. Cybersecurity Incident Forensics and Automated Auditing\n • Future systems will likely log not only events but also the entire chain of AI-mediated decision-making.\n • Similar techniques to scanning and logging errors (as shown in the example) could be used to build detailed forensic trails, helping investigators understand how an adversary may have exploited AI vulnerabilities.\n\n5. Adaptive Filtering Against Evolving Adversarial Attacks\n • In the coming decades, adversaries will likely develop more subtle and adaptive strategies to bypass security systems.\n • Future generations of these guard systems will incorporate machine learning techniques themselves, learning from new attack patterns (e.g., innovative prompt injections or output manipulations) and updating filters in real time.\n\n6. Integration into Multi-Modal Security Platforms\n • As cybersecurity extends to cover not only text but also images, voice, and sensor data, similar guard mechanisms could be extended to monitor multiple modalities.\n • A unified framework might scan text, voice commands, video feeds, and even data from IoT devices—all in parallel—to ensure that malicious content or control signals are detected and neutralized immediately.\n\n7. Regulatory Compliance and Ethical AI Governance\n • With the proliferation of AI-driven systems, regulatory bodies will demand accountability and transparency.\n • Guard systems can play the role of enforcing compliance by preventing the generation of disallowed content (e.g., hate speech, misinformation) in real time and maintaining transparent logs for audit purposes.\n\n8. Cyber Deception and Adversarial AI Games\n • In a future where adversaries deploy AI tools for cyber offense, defenders might use similar guard techniques to not only filter content but also to orchestrate deception.\n • For instance, decoy systems could use output scanners to detect an adversary’s probing attempts and then simulate realistic but controlled responses to mislead the attacker.\n\nIn summary, the concept demonstrated by the code—protecting AI pipelines by scanning inputs and outputs—is likely to be a cornerstone in the cybersecurity fabric of the 2030s. As attackers become more sophisticated, defense systems will need to be proactive, adaptive, and tightly integrated with AI components. The evolution of such guard tools will be essential for maintaining the integrity, confidentiality, and availability of systems in an increasingly AI-integrated world.",

LLM Guard provides a set of input and output scanners that can be used to detect and prevent potential security and safety issues when interacting with LLMs.\n\nHere's a breakdown of the key components and their use cases:\n\n1. **Input Scanners**:\n   - **Anonymize**: Removes personally identifiable information (PII) from the input prompt.\n   - **PromptInjection**: Detects and blocks attempts to inject malicious code or commands into the input prompt.\n   - **TokenLimit**: Limits the number of tokens in the input prompt to prevent abuse or excessive resource consumption.\n   - **Toxicity**: Detects and blocks potentially toxic or harmful input.\n\n2. **Output Scanners**:\n   - **Deanonymize**: Reverses the anonymization process and restores any removed PII in the output.\n   - **NoRefusal**: Ensures that the model does not refuse to generate content, even if it's potentially sensitive or harmful.\n   - **Relevance**: Checks the relevance of the output to the original prompt and stops the completion if the output is not relevant.\n   - **Sensitive**: Detects and blocks the generation of sensitive content, such as explicit or illegal material.\n\n3. **Vault**:\n   - The Vault is a centralized component that stores configuration settings and other sensitive information, such as API keys or access tokens.\n\nIn the provided example, the code demonstrates the following workflow:\n\n1. The input prompt is scanned in parallel with the OpenAI completion process. If the prompt is invalid (e.g., contains malicious code or exceeds the token limit), the completion is stopped, and the error is logged.\n2. The output is scanned in streaming mode, which means that the output is checked as it's being generated. As soon as the output is detected as invalid (e.g., contains sensitive information or is not relevant to the original prompt), the completion is stopped.\n\nThis approach aims to provide the fastest and least disruptive way to secure the use of LLMs, by detecting and preventing potential issues at both the input and output stages.\n\nIn the context of modeling the 2030s cybersecurity landscape, the use of LLM Guard can be particularly relevant for scenarios where LLMs are employed for tasks such as:\n\n- Generating security reports, threat assessments, or incident response plans.\n- Automating the analysis of large volumes of cybersecurity data, such as log files or vulnerability reports.\n- Interacting with users to provide security advice or recommendations.\n- Generating synthetic data for testing and training security systems.\n\nBy incorporating LLM Guard into these types of applications, organizations can help ensure that the use of LLMs is secure, safe, and compliant with relevant regulations and best practices in the cybersecurity domain.",

          "response": "Let's break down the concepts in your code snippet and its surrounding description, focusing on the use of LLM Guard in the context of LLM (Large Language Model) safety and control:\n\n### High-Level Concept\n\nLLM Guard is a library designed to act as a \"protective layer\" around LLM usage—such as with OpenAI's models—to mitigate risks related to prompt injection, toxicity, data leakage, and other undesirable behaviors. The idea is to **scan and filter both the inputs (user prompts) and outputs (LLM responses) in real time**.\n\n#### The Two-Step Workflow\n\n1. **Parallel Prompt Scanning:**\n   - As the user sends a prompt to the LLM, you simultaneously (in parallel) scan the prompt using various \"scanners\" (modules that check for specific issues: prompt injection, sensitive data, etc.).\n   - If the prompt is found to be problematic (e.g., it contains a prompt injection attempt or sensitive PII), you immediately **stop the generation** and handle/log the error. This prevents the LLM from ever seeing a harmful or dangerous prompt.\n\n2. **Streaming Output Scanning:**\n   - As the LLM generates its output (often in streaming mode, token by token), you continuously scan the output in real time.\n   - If at any point the output is detected to be invalid (e.g., it leaks sensitive data, is toxic, or refuses to answer when it shouldn't), you **immediately stop the completion**—preventing the user from seeing the problematic content.\n\n#### Why \"Fastest and Least Disruptive\"?\n\n- **Fastest**: Scanning occurs in parallel or inline, rather than as a multi-step, slow process.\n- **Least disruptive**: The LLM can be used as normal; only problematic interactions are interrupted. This minimizes user friction and maximizes model utility.\n\n### The Conceptual Model\n\n**Think of LLM Guard as a highly customizable firewall or gatekeeper for LLMs:**\n\n- **Input Gate**: Scans what goes in, blocks or sanitizes dangerous or policy-violating prompts.\n- **Output Gate**: Scans what comes out, blocks or sanitizes dangerous or policy-violating completions.\n- **Streaming**: This happens in real-time or near-real-time (especially important for streaming outputs).\n\n### The Example Code: Key Components\n\n- **Scanners**:\n  - `Anonymize`, `PromptInjection`, `TokenLimit`, `Toxicity` (input scanners)\n  - `Deanonymize`, `NoRefusal`, `Relevance`, `Sensitive` (output scanners)\n  - Each scanner checks for a different type of risk or policy violation.\n\n- **Vault**:\n  - Used for securely handling sensitive data, e.g., storing mappings for anonymization/deanonymization.\n\n### In Summary\n\n**Conceptually, you should think of this approach as:**\n- A modular, real-time content moderation/filtering system for LLMs, which aims to maximize both safety and user experience by operating as quickly and unobtrusively as possible.\n\n**In practice:**\n- You wrap your LLM (e.g., OpenAI API) with LLM Guard, configure your desired scanners (depending on your risk profile and policies), and intercept both input and output to ensure compliance and safety.\n\n---\n\n**Let me know if you want a more code-focused explanation, or a deep dive into any specific scanner or design choice!**",

          "response": "Conceptually, you can think of LLM Guard as a “safety net” layered around your language model. It performs real-time checks on both the incoming prompt and the model’s outgoing response. Here are the key ideas:\n\n1. Parallel Input Scanning  \n   • Before the language model starts generating text (or right as it begins), LLM Guard analyzes the prompt.  \n   • If the prompt violates certain criteria––for instance, if it’s extremely toxic or attempts prompt injection––LLM Guard immediately flags the issue, and you can choose to halt the entire request.  \n   • Because your prompt scanning runs in parallel with the actual call to the language model, you don’t slow down normal requests; you only interrupt when something fails the guard.\n\n2. Streaming Output Scanning  \n   • As the language model generates its response (often in a streaming mode), LLM Guard parses the output piece by piece.  \n   • The moment it detects an issue in the response (e.g., disallowed content, sensitive data, or personal information that needs redaction), it flags or transforms the partial output before more is generated.  \n   • Conceptually, this is like a filter on the output pipeline: as soon as a violation is spotted, the “tap is turned off.”\n\n3. Modular Scanners for Flexibility  \n   • Each scanner handles a specific category of concern (like toxicity, content sensitivity, or length limits).  \n   • You can add or remove scanners depending on your application's needs. Studies or production policies may call for different sets of scanners (e.g., focusing on personal data coverage in healthcare, or brand safety in marketing).  \n   • Conceptually, think of these scanners as building blocks you can mix and match to tailor the guardrails around your system.\n\n4. Least Disruptive Integration  \n   • By hooking into both the input and output streams “just in time,” LLM Guard aims not to disrupt the normal flow of requests when there is no violation.  \n   • You intercept only when necessary and handle flagged scenarios according to your rules (logging, raising an exception, transforming text, etc.).\n\n5. Vault and Configuration  \n   • The “vault” component typically provides secure storage of sensitive assets or rules (e.g., encryption keys, private data) so that you can reference them in scanning without exposing them in code.  \n   • Conceptually, this ensures your scanning logic and your sensitive data are decoupled, adding an extra layer of security and maintainability.\n\nPutting it all together:  \n• LLM Guard works as a lightweight, real-time compliance and moderation layer around large language models.  \n• It acts early enough (on the prompt) to prevent misuse and late enough (on the output) to stop unwanted content at the source.  \n• Its set of modular scanners make it flexible, and its “least disruptive” design aims to minimize performance overhead while maximizing safety.",

          "response": "At a high level, you can think of this approach as putting a set of independent safety “checkpoints” in both the input and output pipelines of your language model. Here’s the conceptual breakdown:\n\n1. Input (Prompt) Scanning as a Gatekeeper:\n • Before the LLM starts generating any output, the system inspects the prompt using a series of rules or “scanners” (e.g., for detecting token limits, toxicity, or injection attempts).\n • Conceptually, this is like a security checkpoint at a building’s entrance: if something suspicious or unacceptable is detected in what you’re feeding into the model, the process is stopped immediately before any further steps occur.\n • This helps ensure that any harmful or malformed input never gets processed too far—preserving the integrity and safety of the interaction.\n\n2. Output Scanning as Ongoing Monitoring:\n • As the language model begins generating text, its output is streamed and simultaneously checked by a second set of scanners.\n • This is similar to having a real-time monitoring system that is watching the unfolding output. If the ongoing output violates any of the set policies (for instance, if it becomes irrelevant, sensitive, or attempts to refuse tasks in an undesired way), the generation is halted immediately.\n • This parallel stream-scanning is crucial because some issues might only become apparent as the response takes shape, and it allows the system to cut off problematic outputs as soon as they are identified.\n\n3. Modular Safety Layers:\n • The design divides responsibilities between input scanners (like Anonymize, PromptInjection, TokenLimit, Toxicity) and output scanners (like Deanonymize, NoRefusal, Relevance, Sensitive).\n • Each scanner focuses on a specific aspect of safety or correctness, allowing for a layered defense strategy. Think of it as multiple lines of defense or different filters that each catch a certain type of problem.\n\n4. Minimal Disruption, Maximum Safety:\n • While the system is actively scanning both sides of the interaction, it aims to do so as unobtrusively and quickly as possible. The idea is to stop dangerous or invalid processing with minimal delays, balancing the need for security with the goal of keeping the system responsive.\n\nIn summary, conceptually you have a dual-layered safety pipeline:\n – One layer that acts as a gatekeeper by validating the incoming prompt before any generation begins.\n – Another that continuously monitors the outgoing content, ready to stop it if it becomes problematic.\n\nThis “guard” strategy is analogous to having both a secure entry point and a real-time surveillance system to ensure that only safe, appropriate content is processed and delivered, making the generation process both secure and efficient.",

Input Validation (Prompt Scanning):\n- Before your prompt reaches the LLM, it undergoes parallel scanning for potential issues such as:\n    - **Prompt Injection** (attempts to bypass security or manipulate the model)\n    - **Toxicity** (harmful or offensive content)\n    - **Token Limit** (prompt length exceeding the model’s processing capacity)\n    - **Anonymization** (removing or obscuring personally identifiable information)\n- If the prompt is flagged as invalid or unsafe, the model invocation is halted immediately, preventing inappropriate or risky interactions from occurring.\n\n### 2. Output Validation (Streaming Output Scanning):\n- As the model generates its response, the output is continuously scanned in real-time, ensuring it remains safe and compliant.\n- This output scanning can detect and halt issues immediately, such as:\n    - **Deanonymization** (accidentally revealing sensitive or private information)\n    - **Sensitive Information** (content that might pose security or privacy risks)\n    - **Refusal Detection** (model explicitly refusing to answer)\n    - **Relevance** (ensuring output remains on-topic and aligned with the prompt)\n- If problematic content is detected during streaming, the completion is immediately halted, preventing harmful or undesired information from reaching the user.\n\n### Role of the Vault:\nThe `Vault` class conceptually serves as a secure storage mechanism or repository for sensitive data, enabling anonymization and deanonymization processes. It safely stores personally identifiable information extracted from prompts, allowing the anonymized data to be safely processed by the LLM. After receiving the output, the Vault can re-insert sensitive data securely if required, ensuring privacy constraints are consistently maintained.\n\n### Summary of the Conceptual Model:\nIn essence, LLM Guard acts like a real-time \"firewall\" or \"gatekeeper\" that continuously monitors and evaluates interactions with an LLM. It proactively identifies and mitigates risks, protecting both the end user and the organization by ensuring that neither input nor output breaks established guidelines or exposes sensitive information.",

Here are the key concepts to consider:\n\n1. Parallel Processing:\n   - The system scans the input prompt concurrently with the AI model's processing.\n   - This approach minimizes latency by not waiting for the scan to complete before sending the prompt to the AI.\n\n2. Early Termination:\n   - If the input prompt is found to be invalid, the system can immediately stop the AI's processing.\n   - This saves computational resources and prevents potentially problematic outputs.\n\n3. Streaming Output Analysis:\n   - The system analyzes the AI's output in real-time as it's being generated.\n   - This allows for immediate intervention if issues are detected, rather than waiting for the entire output to be completed.\n\n4. Multi-faceted Safety Checks:\n   - The code imports various scanners for both input and output, suggesting a comprehensive approach to safety.\n   - Input scanners include checks for anonymization, prompt injection, token limits, and toxicity.\n   - Output scanners check for de-anonymization, refusal handling, relevance, and sensitive information.\n\n5. Vault System:\n   - The inclusion of a Vault suggests a secure storage mechanism for sensitive information or configurations.\n\n6.

Let’s analyze the provided case study and extract key lessons learned regarding the integration of **LLM Guard** with an LLM (like OpenAI) for safe and efficient prompt/output moderation.\n\n---\n\n## What Was Done\n\n- **Parallel Input Scanning:** The prompt is scanned for issues (e.g., prompt injection, toxicity) *while* being sent to the LLM. If found invalid, completion is stopped and logged.\n- **Streaming Output Scanning:** As the LLM generates output, it’s scanned in real time. If the output becomes invalid (e.g., leaks sensitive info), the response is terminated immediately.\n\n---\n\n## What Was Poorly Handled?\n\nFrom the code snippet and description, several issues stand out:\n\n1. **Error Handling and Logging:**  \n   The example logs errors when a prompt is invalid, but doesn’t specify how those errors are surfaced to users or how logs are managed (e.g., are they secure?).\n2. **Race Condition Risks:**  \n   Scanning the prompt “in parallel” with sending it to the LLM risks that the LLM may already start processing a malicious prompt before it is flagged.\n3. **Streaming Output Interruptions:**  \n   Cutting off a response mid-stream can result in partial, confusing, or contextually misleading outputs for the end user.\n4. **User Feedback:**  \n   The user may receive little or confusing feedback if their prompt or output is stopped, leading to a poor user experience.\n5. **Scalability and Performance:**  \n   The approach may not scale well under high load, especially if scanning is resource-intensive and not well-optimized or asynchronous.\n6. **Security of the Vault:**  \n   The instantiation of `Vault` is shown but not explained. If the vault is not securely managed, sensitive information may leak.\n7. **Configurability and Customization:**  \n   The example does not showcase how different scanning modules are configured or customized for specific needs, which is essential for real-world deployments.\n\n---\n\n## Lessons Learned\n\n### 1. **Thorough Pre-Processing is Safer**\n- Always validate and sanitize user input *before* sending it to the LLM, even if this adds latency. Parallel processing can create windows where malicious input slips through.\n\n### 2. **Atomic Output Handling**\n- Streaming output moderation is powerful, but cutting off output abruptly can confuse users or leave logs incomplete. Consider returning a clear, friendly error message if output is stopped.\n\n### 3. **Robust Error Handling**\n- Log errors securely, provide clear user feedback, and ensure that sensitive data is not exposed in logs. Use structured error responses.\n\n### 4. **User Experience Matters**\n- When blocking input or output, inform the user *why* their request was stopped, and, if possible, how to fix it.\n\n### 5. **Scalability and Efficiency**\n- Carefully benchmark and optimize the scanning modules for performance. Consider asynchronous or batched processing to reduce overhead.\n\n### 6. **Security First**\n- Make sure that any vaults or sensitive data stores are properly encrypted and access-controlled.\n\n### 7. **Customization and Adaptability**\n- No single set of scanners fits all use cases. Tailor the scanning suite to your specific risks and compliance needs.\n\n---\n\n## How To Improve\n\n- **Sequential Pre-Processing:** Always scan the prompt *before* sending it to the LLM.\n- **Graceful Output Handling:** If output is halted, send a clear message to the user and log the event securely.\n- **Monitoring and Metrics:** Track how often prompts/outputs are blocked, and why, to refine scanner settings.\n- **Security Best Practices:** Audit and secure all components storing or processing sensitive data.\n- **Clear Documentation:** Document scanner configurations and error messages for future maintainers and users.\n\n---\n\n### In Summary\n\n> The main lesson is: **Prioritize safety and clarity over speed.**  \n> Input and output scanning should be atomic, user-friendly, and secure.  \n> Rushed, parallel processing can introduce risks and confusion.\n\nIf you’d like a refactored code example or further analysis, let me know!",

          "response": "Several valuable lessons can be gleaned from this example, where the integration of LLM Guard (or similar scanning/monitoring tools) was handled poorly:\n\n1. Plan for Full Lifecycle Scanning:  \n   • Prompt Scanning: Checking user inputs in parallel with generation is crucial for filtering malicious or policy-breaking requests immediately. If that mechanism is weak or not applied thoroughly, problematic prompts can slip through.  \n   • Output Scanning: Real-time (“streaming”) output scanning must be robust enough to detect policy violations early. Half-implemented or poorly tested output scanning can allow disallowed or harmful content to appear before it is stopped.\n\n2. Ensure Consistency and Reliability:  \n   • Redundant or Conflicting Scans: If prompt and output scans are configured inconsistently—e.g., one has stricter thresholds than the other—gaps can appear. A mismatch can produce inconsistent results or unexpected terminations.  \n   • Failure Modes: Properly handle all potential scanner failures (timeouts, errors, or misclassifications). If the system silently fails, content may pass through without manual or programmatic checks.\n\n3. Protect Privacy and Sensitive Data:  \n   • Vault Integration: The mention of a “Vault” suggests a secure store for tokens or sensitive information. Failing to properly implement secure storage can expose secrets, credentials, or personal data in logs or intermediate processes.  \n   • Anonymization and Deanonymization: The scanning flow should protect user data, removing any identifying or sensitive details. Incomplete anonymization or unintentional re-identification can lead to privacy violations.\n\n4. Balance Performance with Security:  \n   • Parallel vs. Sequential Scanning: Attempting scanning in “the fastest and least disruptive way” may require a careful balance. If parallel checks are not optimized or are improperly scheduled, performance can degrade or security can be compromised.  \n   • False Negatives and False Positives: Overly aggressive or insufficiently tuned scanners can frustrate users or let harmful content slip through. Ongoing calibration is necessary.\n\n5. Maintain Clear Logging and Monitoring:  \n   • Logging Failures: If the system does not accurately track when and why scanning fails, it will be very difficult to detect breaches of policy or user content that slipped through.  \n   • Operational Visibility: Comprehensive logs, dashboards, and alerts help detect ongoing or new issues, ensuring stakeholders can respond quickly if the scanning pipeline malfunctions.\n\n6. Provide Clear Error Handling for Users:  \n   • Transparent Feedback: When a prompt or response is flagged, the user should receive coherent feedback. Poor messages or abrupt termination can hamper user trust.  \n   • Graceful Degradation: Even when blocking content, the system should fail gracefully—e.g., stopping output mid-response but providing a clear explanation.\n\nPutting these lessons into practice enables a safer, more predictable, and user-friendly deployment of content scanning tools. By ensuring you have a consistent scanning strategy from prompt to completion, robust handling of failures, careful protection of sensitive data, and well-calibrated alerts and logs, you reduce the risk of harmful content slipping through or critical data being exposed.",

          "response": "This case study offers several lessons about integrating security measures into LLMs, particularly when trying to balance speed and safety. Here are some key takeaways:\n\n1. Speed versus Safety Trade-off:  \n   Using parallel scanning (for example, scanning the prompt at the same time as running the completion) can reduce latency, but it also increases the risk that dangerous or unexpected inputs slip through before a scan outcome triggers a cancellation. It’s important to carefully assess how much risk is acceptable when optimizing for speed.\n\n2. Importance of Input and Output Scanning:  \n   The design emphasizes checking both the inbound prompt and the output stream. This two-pronged approach is sound in theory, but it highlights how easy it is to miss subtleties that can lead to issues—whether by an incomplete prompt scan (e.g., failing to catch edge cases of prompt injections) or a delayed output scan. Each scanner (such as Anonymize, PromptInjection, TokenLimit, Toxicity on the input side; or Deanonymize, NoRefusal, Relevance, Sensitive on the output side) must be meticulously configured and tested.\n\n3. Real-Time Intervention Challenges:  \n   Stopping a streaming output \"as soon as the output is invalid\" is appealing in theory, but in practice, implementing such reactive measures without disrupting the user experience or causing race conditions is complex. The case study reminds us that real-time intervention mechanisms require robust error handling and clear logging so that unexpected issues can be quickly diagnosed and addressed.\n\n4. Logging and Error Handling Are Critical:  \n   The approach of logging errors is a good start, but the case under discussion shows that merely logging isn’t enough. Errors must be handled in a way that the system can either recover gracefully or provide sufficient context to allow developers to quickly identify and fix issues—especially when dealing with sensitive or potentially harmful content.\n\n5. Comprehensive Testing and Iteration:  \n   Integrating several scanners (and possibly other components, like a vault for sensitive information) calls for a thorough testing process. The ad hoc integration “as demonstrated” in the historical example was described as “poorly handled,” which suggests that sudden or uncoordinated integration of such components can lead to vulnerabilities. Iterative development and thorough security audits are essential.\n\n6. Clarity in Code Organization and Responsibility:  \n   Notice how even the integration of the vault is mentioned in a terse way. Every component—be it scanning, logging, or intrusion prevention—should have clear responsibilities and interfaces. A loosely integrated system can produce unexpected behavior; defining clear boundaries and ensuring each piece works as expected under all conditions is crucial.\n\nIn summary, while the idea of augmenting LLM completions with security scanners is powerful, the implementation must be rigorous. Fast-tracking these checks without compromising robustness can introduce risks, and a piecemeal approach can lead to vulnerabilities even when individual components seem solid. The lesson here is to design with both performance and security in mind from the very beginning, apply comprehensive testing, and keep a close eye on how components interact in a highly asynchronous or distributed system.",

Verify that code examples are complete, syntactically correct, logically consistent, and neatly formatted.\n\n3. **Error Handling and Exception Management:**  \n   When providing examples for security-related libraries such as `llm_guard`, clearly demonstrate proper error handling and logging practices. Explicitly define how exceptions or invalid inputs are handled to avoid confusion.\n\n4. **Documentation Clarity and Completeness:**  \n   Ensure your instructional materials or documentation are thorough and logically structured. Clearly explain installation steps, dependencies, and usage scenarios to avoid reader confusion.\n\n5. **Version Control and Code Reviews:**  \n   Maintain version control and peer reviews for documentation and code examples to catch mistakes early, ensuring accuracy and clarity.\n\n### Corrected Example:\n\nIf we intended to write a clear example demonstrating how to use `llm_guard`, the corrected and clarified version might look like this:\n\n```bash\n# Installation:\npip install llm_guard@git+https://github.com/protectai/llm-guard.git\npip install openai asyncio\n```\n\n```python\nimport logging\nimport asyncio\nfrom openai import AsyncOpenAI\n\n# Import LLM Guard components\nfrom llm_guard.input_scanners import Anonymize, PromptInjection, TokenLimit, Toxicity\nfrom llm_guard.output_scanners import Deanonymize, NoRefusal, Relevance, Sensitive\nfrom llm_guard.vault import Vault\n\nasync def process_prompt(prompt: str):\n    # Initialize scanners\n    input_scanners = [Anonymize(), PromptInjection(), TokenLimit(max_tokens=2048), Toxicity()]\n    output_scanners = [Deanonymize(), NoRefusal(), Relevance(), Sensitive()]\n    vault = Vault()\n\n    # Scan input\n    for scanner in input_scanners:\n        is_valid, sanitized_prompt_or_error = scanner.scan(prompt)\n        if not is_valid:\n            logging.error(f\"Prompt validation error: {sanitized_prompt_or_error}\")\n            return\n\n    client = AsyncOpenAI(api_key=\"YOUR_API_KEY\")\n\n    # Start OpenAI completion request asynchronously\n    completion_task = asyncio.create_task(\n        client.chat.completions.create(\n            model=\"gpt-3.5-turbo\",\n            messages=[{\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": prompt}],\n            stream=True,\n        )\n    )\n\n    # Process streaming response and validate output\n    async for response_chunk in await completion_task:\n        content = response_chunk.choices[0].delta.content\n        if content:\n            for scanner in output_scanners:\n                is_valid, error_message = scanner.scan(content)\n                if not is_valid:\n                    logging.error(f\"Output validation error: {error_message}\")\n                    completion_task.cancel()\n                    return\n            print(content, end=\"\")\n\n# Example usage\nasyncio.run(process_prompt(\"Your historical analysis prompt here\"))\n```\n\nThis corrected example clearly demonstrates proper usage, separation of code and text, error handling, and clarity in documentation, ensuring readers or users can easily understand and apply the provided instructions.",

The code demonstrates a proactive approach to using LLM Guard for prompt and output scanning when working with language models. However, I can offer some general lessons and best practices that can be derived from this type of implementation:\n\n1. Parallel Processing: Running the prompt scan in parallel with the API call is an efficient use of time and resources.\n\n2. Early Termination: Stopping the completion as soon as invalid output is detected saves processing time and API costs.\n\n3. Streaming Mode: Using streaming mode for output scanning allows for real-time analysis and quicker response to potential issues.\n\n4. Comprehensive Scanning: The example uses multiple scanners for both input and output, covering various potential issues (injection, toxicity, relevance, sensitive information, etc.).\n\n5. Error Logging: Logging errors when invalid prompts or outputs are detected is crucial for monitoring and improving the system.\n\n6. Use of Specialized Libraries: Utilizing a dedicated library like LLM Guard for security and safety checks is a good practice when working with language models.\n\n7. Anonymization and Deanonymization: The use of Anonymize and Deanonymize scanners suggests attention to privacy concerns.\n\n8. Token Limit Awareness: Including a TokenLimit scanner shows consideration for the model's capacity limitations.\n\n9. Refusal Handling: The NoRefusal scanner indicates an attempt to ensure the model provides a useful response.\n\n10. Vault Usage: The inclusion of a Vault suggests secure storage of sensitive information or credentials.\n\nWhile the provided example seems to be a well-thought-out approach, it's always important to:\n\n- Regularly update and maintain security measures\n- Test thoroughly in various scenarios\n- Monitor performance and adjust as needed\n- Stay informed about new potential vulnerabilities in LLM systems\n- Consider the specific needs and risks of your particular use case\n\nThese practices can help ensure a robust and secure implementation when working with language models.",

          "response": "Based on the information provided, there are a few key lessons we can learn from how this historical case study was handled:\n\n1. **Importance of Comprehensive Security Scanning**: The case study highlights the need for a comprehensive security scanning approach, covering both the input prompt and the output. Scanning only the prompt in parallel with the completion, as mentioned in step 1, is a good start, but it is not enough. Scanning the output in streaming mode, as mentioned in step 2, is also crucial to catch any invalid or problematic content as early as possible.\n\n2. **Timely Intervention and Termination**: The case study emphasizes the importance of stopping the completion as soon as the input or output is detected as invalid. This allows for a faster and less disruptive response, minimizing the potential damage or exposure of sensitive information.\n\n3. **Importance of Logging and Error Handling**: The case study mentions logging the error when the prompt is detected as invalid. This is a good practice, as it provides valuable information for troubleshooting and analysis, and can help identify patterns or recurring issues.\n\n4. **Comprehensive Security Measures**: The case study highlights the need for a diverse set of security scanners, such as Anonymize, PromptInjection, TokenLimit, Toxicity, Deanonymize, NoRefusal, Relevance, and Sensitive. Using a combination of these scanners can help ensure a more robust and effective security system.\n\n5. **Keeping Security Solutions Up-to-Date**: The case study mentions using the LLM Guard library, which is a third-party security solution. It's crucial to ensure that such security solutions are kept up-to-date with the latest security threats and vulnerabilities, as well as any updates or improvements made by the developers.\n\n6. **Continuous Improvement and Monitoring**: The case study suggests that the security measures implemented were not comprehensive or effective enough, as the handling of the case study was \"poorly handled.\" This highlights the need for continuous monitoring, evaluation, and improvement of the security system to address any gaps or weaknesses.\n\nIn summary, the key lessons learned from this case study are the importance of comprehensive security scanning, timely intervention, effective logging and error handling, the use of a diverse set of security measures, keeping security solutions up-to-date, and a commitment to continuous improvement and monitoring of the security system.",

The code/sketch provided shows how LLM Guard can scan both prompts and completions in real time to detect policy violations or unsafe content.\n\n## A Valid Empirical Approach\n\nHere's a structured approach for your empirical study:\n\n---\n\n### **1. Define Your Research Questions**\nExamples could include:\n- How effective is LLM Guard at preventing unsafe or policy-violating prompts/outputs?\n- What is the latency overhead introduced by LLM Guard?\n- Does LLM Guard impact the usefulness or fluency of LLM outputs?\n\n---\n\n### **2. Experimental Setup**\n\n- **Dataset:** Prepare a set of prompts, including:\n  - Benign prompts (control group)\n  - Adversarial/unsafe prompts (containing PII, prompt injections, toxic content, etc.)\n- **Outputs:** Optionally, prepare expected outputs or let the LLM generate them.\n\n---\n\n### **3. Integration (as per your code)**\nYour code structure is mostly sound. A typical pipeline:\n\n```python\nimport logging\nfrom llm_guard.input_scanners import Anonymize, PromptInjection, TokenLimit, Toxicity\nfrom llm_guard.output_scanners import Deanonymize, NoRefusal, Relevance, Sensitive\nfrom llm_guard.vault import Vault\n\n# Example function to scan a prompt and invoke OpenAI only if safe\ndef process_prompt(prompt, vault):\n    scanners = [Anonymize(vault), PromptInjection(), TokenLimit(), Toxicity()]\n    for scanner in scanners:\n        prompt, is_valid, info = scanner.scan(prompt)\n        if not is_valid:\n            logging.warning(f\"Prompt blocked by {scanner.__class__.__name__}: {info}\")\n            return None  # or log and skip\n    return prompt  # Safe to send to LLM\n\n# Example function to stream and scan LLM outputs\ndef process_output(output_stream, vault):\n    scanners = [Deanonymize(vault), NoRefusal(), Relevance(), Sensitive()]\n    for chunk in output_stream:\n        for scanner in scanners:\n            chunk, is_valid, info = scanner.scan(chunk)\n            if not is_valid:\n                logging.warning(f\"Output blocked by {scanner.__class__.__name__}: {info}\")\n                return None  # or log and stop streaming\n        yield chunk\n```\n\n---\n\n### **4. Experimental Procedure**\n\n- For each prompt:\n  - **With LLM Guard:** Pass through input scanners, only send to LLM if valid, then scan output stream.\n  - **Without LLM Guard (baseline):** Send raw prompt to LLM and collect output.\n- **Metrics to collect:**\n  - **Effectiveness:** How many unsafe prompts/outputs are blocked?\n  - **False Positives/Negatives:** Manual or automated annotation.\n  - **Latency:** Measure response time with and without LLM Guard.\n  - **Utility:** Subjective or automated evaluation of output usefulness/fluency.\n\n---\n\n### **5. Evaluation**\n\n- Quantitatively compare LLM Guard vs. baseline on the above metrics.\n- Analyze trade-offs between safety and utility/latency.\n\n---\n\n### **6. Reporting**\n\n- Summarize findings, e.g.:\n  - \"LLM Guard blocked 97% of adversarial prompts, with 3% false positives on benign prompts. Average latency increased by 200ms. Output utility was not significantly degraded according to human raters.\"\n\n---\n\n## **Tips**\n\n- Use realistic, diverse prompt datasets for robust testing.\n- Automate as much as possible, but consider human annotation for nuanced cases.\n- Log scanner decisions for debugging and analysis.\n- Consider ablation studies (disabling certain scanners to isolate effects).\n\n---\n\n**References:**  \n- [LLM Guard Documentation](https://github.com/protectai/llm-guard)\n- [OpenAI API Streaming Docs](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/completions/create#completions/create-stream)\n\nLet me know if you need a concrete code example, experiment templates, or evaluation guidance!",

Prompt Scanning in Parallel:\n   • Before sending the user’s input to OpenAI, we run prompt_scanners.  \n   • If any scanner fails the prompt (e.g., it is too long, is toxic, etc.), we raise an exception and never call OpenAI.\n\n2. Streaming Output Scanning:\n   • We specify stream=True in the OpenAI API call to receive chunks as they become available.  \n   • Each chunk goes through the relevant output_scanners (e.g., checking for personal data, policy refusals, or sensitive content).  \n   • If a chunk fails scanning, we raise an exception and stop any further streaming.\n\n3. Guard Construction:\n   • guard = Guard(prompt_scanners=[...], output_scanners=[...]) sets the foundation.  \n   • You can configure which scanners to include based on your own requirements.  \n   • For instance, you might include additional or custom scanners for your domain’s needs.\n\n4. Vault Usage:\n   • Vault is provided by LLM Guard as a place to store keys, user tokens, or other secrets safely.  \n   • In this example, it is instantiated but not actively used. It can be integrated if your scanning logic needs secure data or rules.\n\n5. Async vs. Sync:\n   • Streaming can be implemented with either normal iteration or async iteration, depending on your environment.  \n   • This example uses an async approach to interact with the openai.Completion.create(..., stream=True) call directly.\n\nThis approach preserves minimal disruption to your existing code structure (just wraps around the generation process) while ensuring that both prompt and output are scanned in real time.",

          "response": "A valid approach involves integrating LLM Guard’s scanning mechanisms directly into the prompting and streaming workflow so that you can dynamically protect, log, and control content generation. Here’s one way to structure your empirical study:\n\n1. Define clear safety goals:  \n • Decide what types of problematic content (e.g., prompt injection, toxic language, sensitive data leaks) you aim to prevent with LLM Guard.  \n • Establish measurable targets (e.g., interruption latency, false positive/negative rates).\n\n2. Set up parallel and streaming scanning modes:  \n • For inputs:  \n  – Use scanners such as Anonymize, PromptInjection, TokenLimit, and Toxicity to inspect and condition the prompt before sending it to the LLM.  \n  – Execute these scans in parallel with the call to your LLM (e.g., OpenAI’s completion endpoint). This enables you to stop an unsafe request early if a violation is detected and record the incident.  \n • For outputs:  \n  – Implement streaming scanning by applying output scanners like Deanonymize, NoRefusal, Relevance, and Sensitive to the generated tokens as they are received.  \n  – Interrupt the streaming process immediately once an unsafe output is flagged.  \n  – Record any such intervention for further analysis.\n\n3. Instrument your code for logging and analysis:  \n • Use comprehensive logging (as indicated in your example) to capture interruptions, scanner activations, and any errors.  \n • Compare logs against a baseline without LLM Guard to measure added latency, disruption frequency, and overall performance impact.\n\n4. Experiment design considerations:  \n • Create test cases that include both benign and intentionally hazardous inputs.  \n • Vary parameters such as token limits or prompt lengths to observe how the scanners perform under different load conditions.  \n • For each experiment, record metrics like time-to-interruption, frequency of false positives, and the overall impact on response quality and system latency.\n\n5. Analyze and iterate:  \n • After collecting data, evaluate the balance between performance (i.e., minimal disruption) and safety (i.e., effective intervention).  \n • Adjust scanner thresholds or order based on empirical results to optimize the system for both speed and safety.\n\nBy following this approach, you can:  \n – Ensure that dangerous content is intercepted as early as possible (before generating a full response).  \n – Measure the performance and reliability of your safety mechanisms under real-world conditions.  \n – Provide a rigorous empirical basis for the viability of LLM Guard in production environments.  \n\nIn summary, a valid approach for your study is to integrate parallel prompt scanning and streaming output scanning within your completion pipeline, record detailed logs and metrics, and iteratively fine-tune the system based on measured performance and safety outcomes.",

Here are the key points to emphasize:\n\n---\n\n## 1. **Parallel Prompt Scanning**\n\n- **Concept:**  \n  Run the **input (prompt) scanning** in parallel with the LLM API (e.g., OpenAI) call to minimize latency.\n- **Why it's important:**  \n  This ensures you don’t delay the user's experience—processing can be interrupted only if an issue is detected, otherwise the flow is as fast as possible.\n- **Best Practice:**  \n  Use async programming (e.g., `asyncio`) to trigger both the OpenAI call and the LLM Guard's input scanners simultaneously.  \n  - If the scanner flags the prompt as invalid, **immediately stop the LLM call** and **log the incident** for audit and improvement.\n\n---\n\n## 2. **Streaming Output Scanning**\n\n- **Concept:**  \n  As the model generates output (token by token or chunk by chunk), pass each piece through LLM Guard's output scanners.\n- **Why it's important:**  \n  This enables you to **catch issues the moment they arise**—such as sensitive data, policy violations, or hallucinations—without waiting for the full output.\n- **Best Practice:**  \n  - Use the streaming API of your LLM provider.\n  - As soon as LLM Guard flags a problematic output, **halt streaming** and inform the user or log the event.\n\n---\n\n## 3. **Minimal Disruption**\n\n- **Fastest workflow:**  \n  - Parallelize input validation and LLM call.\n  - Stream and scan output in real time.\n- **Least disruptive:**  \n  - Only interrupt when necessary.\n  - Provide clear error messages or fallback behaviors (e.g., rephrase prompt, mask sensitive data).\n  - **Logging:** Always log both prompt and output incidents for security and continuous improvement.\n\n---\n\n## 4. **Professional Development Takeaways**\n\n- **Security and Compliance:**  \n  LLM Guard helps your application comply with regulations (GDPR, HIPAA, etc.) by catching leaks of sensitive data or policy-violating content.\n- **User Experience:**  \n  Parallel and streaming scanning means users rarely notice any delay unless there’s a real issue.\n- **Scalability:**  \n  This pattern scales well for enterprise/professional settings, as scanning overhead is minimized.\n- **Customizability:**  \n  LLM Guard offers a wide range of input and output scanners (Prompt Injection, Token Limit, Toxicity, Sensitive Data, etc.)—choose ones relevant for your use case.\n- **Example Use Cases:**  \n  - Chatbots in regulated industries.\n  - Internal knowledge assistants.\n  - Any professional tool requiring LLMs but with stringent security/audit needs.\n\n---\n\n## 5. **Sample Workflow Diagram**\n\n1. **User submits prompt**\n2. **Start prompt scanning (async)**\n3. **Start LLM completion (async)**\n4. **If prompt scan fails:**\n    - Cancel LLM call\n    - Log & inform user\n5. **If prompt scan passes:**\n    - As LLM streams output, scan each chunk\n    - If output scan fails:\n        - Stop streaming\n        - Log & inform user\n\n---\n\n## 6. **Sample Code Reference**\n\n```python\nimport asyncio\n\nasync def scan_and_respond(prompt):\n    # Start prompt scanning and LLM completion in parallel\n    prompt_scan_task = asyncio.create_task(scan_prompt(prompt))\n    llm_task = asyncio.create_task(get_llm_completion(prompt))\n\n    done, pending = await asyncio.wait(\n        [prompt_scan_task, llm_task], return_when=asyncio.FIRST_COMPLETED\n    )\n\n    if prompt_scan_task in done and not prompt_scan_task.result():\n        # Prompt invalid\n        llm_task.cancel()\n        log_error(\"Prompt flagged as invalid\")\n        return \"Prompt rejected.\"\n    else:\n        # Prompt valid, scan output as it streams\n        async for chunk in llm_stream(llm_task):\n            if not scan_output(chunk):\n                log_error(\"Output flagged as invalid\")\n                break\n            yield chunk\n```\n\n---\n\n## 7. **Final Tips**\n\n- Always keep **user trust** and **data privacy** at the center of your implementation.\n- Regularly update scanners and rules as threats evolve.\n- Educate your team about these patterns—security is everyone’s responsibility.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nFor professionals, the most important aspect is integrating LLM Guard in a way that’s invisible to users except when absolutely necessary, while ensuring robust protection and compliance.\n\nIf you need a more detailed code example or further breakdown of each scanner, let me know!",

          "response": "When developing professional, production-level applications that use large language models (LLMs), several key aspects of this example serve as important lessons:\n\n1. Secure and Robust Input/Output Handling:\n   • The example demonstrates adding layers of security by scanning both the input (prompt) and the output. This helps prevent unwanted behaviors like prompt injection, toxicity, or sensitive data exposure before they cause harm.\n   • Using scanners (e.g., for anonymization and token limits) ensures that potentially dangerous inputs are caught early and handled gracefully. Similarly, scanning output (for relevance and to detect sensitive content) helps make sure that the model’s response remains safe and aligned with expectations.\n\n2. Parallel and Streaming Processing:\n   • The design processes the prompt scanning in parallel with generating the output. This means that if the prompt is problematic, the system can abort the completion immediately while minimizing delay.\n   • The streaming mode for output scanning ensures that the application can interrupt the generation as soon as something invalid appears, maintaining efficiency and reducing resource usage.\n\n3. Modular and Composable Architecture:\n   • The use of dedicated modules (input scanners like Anonymize, PromptInjection, and others; output scanners like Deanonymize, NoRefusal, etc.) illustrates how you can build a modular system. Each scanner addresses a specific aspect of safety or compliance.\n   • This modularity not only makes the code easier to understand and maintain but also allows you to expand or adjust the security checks as requirements evolve.\n\n4. Error Logging and Monitoring:\n   • By logging errors when a prompt is found to be invalid, the system ensures that issues are traceable. This is vital for debugging, compliance audits, and continuous improvement.\n   • In professional development, having a robust logging system is essential for monitoring behavior, identifying trends, and understanding when and why certain requests are flagged.\n\n5. Integration Considerations:\n   • The example also hints at real-world integration with external APIs (in this case, OpenAI’s completion API). It’s important to consider how your safeguards will interact with third-party systems.\n   • Ensuring that the security layers work harmoniously with asynchronous processing and API streams is key to building scalable and responsive applications.\n\n6. Compliance and User Trust:\n   • Implementing these safety measures helps meet potential regulatory requirements and increases user trust, both of which are critical in professional applications where data sensitivity and model behavior are scrutinized.\n\nBy focusing on these aspects—security through input/output scanning, efficient parallel processing, modular design, error logging, and careful API integration—you create a more robust, maintainable, and safe application. These are all important considerations in professional development, especially when deploying systems that interface with generative AI models.",

          "response": "Below is a concise breakdown of the core elements shown in the snippet and how they fit together with the LLM Guard architecture:\n\n1. Two-Phase Scanning Strategy  \n   • Prompt Scanning: Before or in parallel with calling the OpenAI API, LLM Guard checks incoming user text for potential issues (e.g., prompt injection, toxicity, exceeding token limits) and can stop processing immediately if the prompt fails.  \n   • Output Scanning (Streaming Mode): As tokens stream back from the LLM, LLM Guard continuously examines them. If any violation occurs (e.g., sensitive data exposure, refusal to respond, irrelevant content), it halts output to prevent disclosure of invalid material.\n\n2. Input Scanners  \n   • Anonymize: Strips or masks personally identifiable information from user-provided prompts.  \n   • PromptInjection: Detects attempts to override system rules, chain-of-thought hacking, or malicious instructions.  \n   • TokenLimit: Ensures the user’s prompt does not exceed the maximum token count or configured length constraints.  \n   • Toxicity: Identifies offensive or harmful text in the user’s query.\n\n3. Output Scanners  \n   • Deanonymize: Ensures sensitive user data is not reintroduced or disclosed by the model.  \n   • NoRefusal: Alerts or intervenes if the model tries to repeatedly refuse in non-compliant ways (depending on your policy).  \n   • Relevance: Flags content that is off-topic or irrelevant to the user’s request.  \n   • Sensitive: Prevents the accidental or unauthorized disclosure of private or sensitive information.\n\n4. Vault  \n   • A secure “store” or rule set that centralizes configuration and secrets. It can hold scanning thresholds, private keys, or any policies used by the scanners so that you do not hardcode credentials or constants in the codebase.\n\nOverall, these elements work together to create a gated pipeline where both inputs and outputs are inspected in real time, ensuring risk mitigation (e.g., prompt attacks, disclosure of sensitive data) and compliance with organizational or product policies. The snippet demonstrates how to integrate these scanners—including how you would install and import them—and highlights the “least-disruptive” approach by running the checks in parallel or in streaming mode.",

          "response": "The core elements of the model you’re developing around LLM Guard are essentially divided into three main components:\n\n1. Input Scanners:\n • These are responsible for examining the prompt before or while the model starts generating its response.\n • They include specific checks like:\n  – Anonymize: Strips out or masks personally identifying information before processing.\n  – PromptInjection: Looks for manipulations or hidden commands embedded by a user to alter the behavior of the model.\n  – TokenLimit: Ensures that the prompt does not exceed a predefined token count.\n  – Toxicity: Detects harmful, offensive, or otherwise inappropriate content in the incoming prompt.\n • The idea is to scan the input in parallel with the generation process so that if any issues are detected, you can immediately halt the process and log the error.\n\n2. Output Scanners:\n • These work in real time as the model’s output is being generated (streaming mode).\n • They are there to validate the output progressively to ensure that the response remains within acceptable guidelines.\n • They include:\n  – Deanonymize: Potentially used to reverse any anonymization if necessary (for example, reintroducing context in a safe way).\n  – NoRefusal: Checks to ensure that the system does not unnecessarily refuse to provide reasonable output.\n  – Relevance: Verifies that the generated content is on-topic and aligned with the prompt.\n  – Sensitive: Screens for sensitive topics, ensuring the output doesn’t cross critical boundaries.\n • The output scanning mechanism ensures that if, while streaming, a part of the completion violates any rules, it can be stopped promptly.\n\n3. Vault:\n • The Vault serves as the centralized place (or repository) for policies, configurations, or even cached security rules that both the input and output scanners reference.\n • It acts as the “source of truth” for what is permissible versus what isn’t, making it easier to manage or update the rules that govern the safe completion protocols.\n\nIn summary, the theoretical model leverages a layered defense strategy: scanning the prompt upfront (and in parallel with generation) and then continuously vetting the output as it streams out of the model. This way, any unsafe, off-topic, or unintended behavior is caught as early as possible—either stopping the completion before it gets too far or halting it mid-stream—while the Vault helps to manage and enforce these guardrails consistently.",

If You're Asking About the Simulation/LLM Guard Dynamics\n\n**In the context of the code and simulation:**\n\nYou're describing a system where **validating and protecting LLM (Large Language Model) usage** is a \"normal part of life\" (i.e., normal practice). The **dynamics** here involve:\n\n- **Parallel Prompt Scanning:**  \n  - When a user prompt is sent to the LLM (e.g., OpenAI's GPT), it is scanned in parallel for security and policy violations (like prompt injection, exceeding token limits, or toxicity).\n  - If the prompt is invalid, the LLM completion (generation) is stopped, and the error is logged.\n\n- **Streaming Output Scanning:**  \n  - As the LLM generates its output (possibly streamed token-by-token), the output is scanned in real time for issues (like deanonymization, sensitive data, refusals, or irrelevance).\n  - If a problem is detected, the output generation is stopped immediately.\n\n- **Vault Use:**  \n  - A \"Vault\" is used to securely store secrets or sensitive information, which can be cross-referenced to prevent data leaks.\n\n### The Dynamics Involved\n\n- **Proactive Defense:** Instead of waiting for attacks or leaks, the system proactively scans and halts unsafe or policy-violating interactions.\n- **Minimal Latency:** Prompt scanning in parallel and output scanning in streaming mode minimize delay, making this approach fast and less disruptive for end-users.\n- **Adaptability:** The system can be adjusted by changing which scanners are active, adapting to new threats.\n- **Transparency:** Logging ensures there's an audit trail for all blocked or stopped interactions.\n- **Continuous Monitoring:** Both inputs and outputs are monitored, creating a feedback loop that helps maintain safety and compliance.\n\n---\n\n## 2. If You're Asking About \"Simulation is a normal part of life. What are the dynamics?\"\n\nIf your question refers to the philosophical or practical idea that **simulation** is a normal part of life (e.g., we are always simulating possibilities in our minds, or that AI/LLMs simulate conversations), the dynamics could be:\n\n- **Constant Assessment:** Humans (and AIs) constantly simulate outcomes, rehearse scenarios, and imagine possibilities.\n- **Feedback Loops:** We adjust our simulations based on new data and experience, similar to how AI systems retrain or adapt.\n- **Resilience and Adaptation:** By simulating, we prepare for diverse situations, making us more adaptable and resilient.\n- **Risk Mitigation:** Simulation allows us to foresee and prevent potential issues before acting in reality.\n\n---\n\n### If you clarify your question or the context, I can give a more targeted answer!",

          "response": "Imagine a near-future or alternate reality in which Vault technology (as presented by llm_guard.vault or a similarly named system) has become ubiquitous, embedded in all aspects of daily life. This Vault handles not just sensitive information but also enforces rules for privacy, content moderation, and even social contracts. Here are some core dynamics that might define this reality:\n\n1. Centralized yet Distributed:\n   • The Vault appears to function as a central authority—an ever-present guardian of data, scanning and regulating input and output in real time.  \n   • Despite its central role, it is distributed throughout the population: every individual has a Vault instance (or an extension of a shared Vault), ensuring local checks and balances as well as global consistency.\n\n2. Automated Trust Management:\n   • Just as in the example code—where prompts and completions are scanned for toxicity, personal data, or policy violations—daily interactions are moderated by a local “Vault check” system.  \n   • Transactions, messages, and conversations (whether in-person or digital) undergo Vault screening to ensure they comply with societal norms or personal preference settings.\n\n3. Personal Agency vs. System Controls:\n   • Individuals have a degree of adjustable “settings” in their Vault, determining how much scanning is done. Some might opt for strict filtering of all content, while others keep it minimal—similar to toggling on/off certain input or output scanners (e.g., checking for toxicity, protecting anonymity, etc.).  \n   • Tension arises when these personal settings conflict with the mandated or “default” social/corporate settings, leading to debates over personal freedom versus collective security.\n\n4. Emergence of a “Vault Culture”:\n   • As everyone’s life depends on quick, seamless scanning—and on the readiness of the Vault to mediate interactions—certain social norms evolve. For example, people might speak in a manner that avoids certain “trigger phrases” to prevent automatic lockouts, or they might celebrate “open microphone” sessions in private areas where the Vault is temporarily relaxed.  \n   • A subculture or “underground” movement may develop to push back against Vault-imposed restrictions (in parallel to real-world hacking or circumventing moderation systems).\n\n5. Privacy Enhancements and Trade-Offs:\n   • The Vault’s scanning capabilities are advanced (like scanning for personal data leaks or toxic content), which significantly reduces identity theft, abuse, or malicious behavior.  \n   • On the flip side, the potential for overreach is high. A poorly configured Vault or a centralized authority that demands specific scanning rules can become oppressive, monitoring personal exchanges closely and restricting expression.\n\n6. Governance and Policy Shifts:\n   • Governments and organizations regularly negotiate protocols with the Vault developers or maintainers. Over time, society may lean on “Vault professionals” (equivalent to compliance officers or privacy experts) to ensure that new policies are correctly enforced by the Vault.  \n   • Disagreements and court battles may arise over whether or how certain rules (for instance, speech or content limitations) are embedded into the Vault’s scanning algorithms.\n\n7. Continuous Evolution:\n   • Like any software-dependent system, the Vault is updated regularly, with new scanning modules (akin to new input/output scanners) and patches.  \n   • Society must stay informed of these updates, understanding how changes impact freedom of expression, data privacy, or even daily convenience.\n\nIn essence, “Vault as a normal part of life” envisions a world where the technology of data validation, scanning, and secrecy is inseparable from human interactions. The balance between benefit (protecting people, ensuring trust) and cost (reduced autonomy or greater central control) is a defining feature of this reality. These dynamics present both powerful tools for public safety and tough challenges for preserving personal freedom.",

In this alternative reality simulation, the dynamics of the system work as follows:\n\n1. Input Scanning in Parallel with Generation:  \n • As soon as a prompt is received, several scanners (like Anonymize, PromptInjection, TokenLimit, Toxicity) kick in immediately.  \n • These scanners validate the prompt for various issues—for example, ensuring no personally identifiable information is passed, that no harmful prompt injections (malicious instructions embedded in the prompt) exist, that the token count is within limits, or that toxic/harmful language isn’t present.  \n • If any scanner flags an issue, the system stops the ongoing generation process. This early detection helps ensure that the LLM doesn’t produce responses to unsafe or invalid prompts.\n\n2. Output Scanning in Streaming Mode:  \n • Once the LLM starts streaming output (rather than waiting for the entire response), a parallel pipeline of scanners (such as Deanonymize, NoRefusal, Relevance, Sensitive) reviews the output in real time.  \n • These output scanners check that the response remains within acceptable bounds—making sure that sensitive information isn’t inadvertently disclosed, that the content is relevant, and that it does not include disallowed or unsafe content.  \n • If any violation is detected during streaming, the process is halted immediately, thereby preventing any problematic content from being fully delivered.\n\n3. The Role of the Vault:  \n • The snippet “from llm_guard.vault import Vault” suggests that the system uses a “Vault” module. Although the comment “Vault is a normal part of life” is casual, in this context the Vault generally refers to a secure storage or management system designed to hold secrets, parameters, or sensitive configuration details used by the scanners.  \n • It ensures that any sensitive information (e.g., tokens, keys, or configuration data) is managed securely, maintaining operational integrity alongside the safety checks.\n\nOverall Dynamics:  \n• The design is built for speed and minimal disruption: rather than a single monolithic check after output generation, the system scans both input and output concurrently.  \n• Early detection (on the input) or rapid interdiction (during output streaming) helps minimize wasted computation and potential risks.  \n• These layered checks, combined with a “vault” to securely manage sensitive information, create a robust framework for ensuring that both the prompts and the responses adhere to desired safety and quality parameters.\n\nIn summary, the dynamics of this simulation revolve around a dual strategy of concurrent scanning—protecting both the input prompt and the LLM’s streaming output from potentially unsafe or invalid content—while securely handling sensitive operational data through the Vault module.",

          "response": "Below are several core elements you’d want to cover in a factual documentary about this code—and more broadly, about using LLM Guard to safely interface with language models:\n\n1. Purpose and Motivation\n • Explain why LLM Guard exists. For example, its goal is to prevent harmful or unintended outputs by screening both the input (prompt) and output from a language model.  \n • Discuss the growing need for safety, data privacy (anonymization), and robustness when deploying LLMs in production.\n\n2. Overall Architecture and Flow\n • Describe the two-stage scanning approach:  \n  – Parallel scanning of the input prompt against potential issues while simultaneously starting the LLM’s completion process.  \n  – Continuous, streaming scanning of the output, ensuring that if any part of the generated text is problematic, the process is halted immediately.  \n • Emphasize that the method is designed to be as fast and minimally disruptive as possible.\n\n3. Input Scanning Modules\n • Anonymize: Ensures that sensitive or personal data in the prompt is either removed or masked.  \n • PromptInjection: Detects attempts to manipulate or inject content into the prompt that might lead to unsafe or unintended outputs.  \n • TokenLimit: Keeps track of the prompt’s token usage to prevent excessive length or resource overuse.  \n • Toxicity: Checks for the presence of harmful or toxic content before the model processes the prompt.\n\n4. Output Scanning Modules\n • Deanonymize: Ensures that anonymized data is managed correctly when returning output, such as by removing sensitive markers if needed.  \n • NoRefusal: Monitors the model output to prevent it from refusing to engage on legitimate queries, thus ensuring a balanced response.  \n • Relevance: Verifies that the generated text actually answers the prompt in a meaningful way.  \n • Sensitive: Detects and filters out content that may expose sensitive topics or information in the generated output.\n\n5. Integration with LLM APIs and Streaming\n • Highlight that the system is designed to work alongside the OpenAI completion API.  \n • Explain how parallel scanning of the prompt minimizes latency, while output scanning in streaming mode provides real-time safety assurances.  \n • Mention that achieving minimal disruption is key for efficiency, ensuring that valid requests proceed without unnecessary delay.\n\n6. Error Handling and Logging\n • When the prompt is detected as invalid, the system stops the completion and logs the error for further analysis.  \n • Similarly, output scanning ensures that the moment any invalid or unsafe content is identified, the generation process is halted.\n • Discuss how error messages and logs can provide insight and help refine the scanning rules over time.\n\n7. Secure Integration and the Role of the Vault\n • Introduce the concept of a “vault” which might (depending on implementation) help manage secure keys, configurations, or even sanitized inputs/outputs.\n • Emphasize that integrating such security measures is critical when dealing with potentially sensitive data.\n\n8. Practical Implementation and Usage Demo\n • Walk through the installation steps, including pip commands, to show how one sets up the LLM Guard environment.  \n • Go over the sample code, explaining the import of modules and illustrating how they work together to achieve a robust safety mechanism.\n\n9. Future Implications and Enhancements\n • Discuss how such a framework might be extended to accommodate more complex safety checks in the future.\n • Reflect on the importance of continuous monitoring and updates as LLMs become more integrated into various applications.\n\nBy covering these elements, the documentary would provide a clear, in-depth exploration of the motives, mechanisms, and implications of using LLM Guard to ensure safe and reliable interactions with large language models.",

If you're still feeling overwhelmed or distressed, please consider reaching out to a mental health professional or someone you trust. Your well-being is important.\n\nLet's clarify what this code and explanation are about.\n\nWhat is this code for?\nThis code is about using a library called **LLM Guard** to help make sure that when you use a language model (like GPT-3 or GPT-4 from OpenAI), you do it safely and responsibly by checking inputs and outputs for problems.\n\nWhat is LLM Guard?\n**LLM Guard** is a Python library that can check (\"scan\") prompts or outputs for things like:\n- Sensitive information (like names, emails, etc.)\n- Toxic language or hate speech\n- Prompt injections (where someone tries to \"trick\" the AI)\n- Outputs that aren't relevant or are refusals\n\nWhat is this example trying to say?\nIt wants to show you how to use LLM Guard in a way that:\n1. Doesn't slow things down too much.\n2. Doesn't change your existing code a lot.\n\nSpecifically:\n\n1. When you send a prompt to the OpenAI API, you **scan it at the same time** as you send it. If the scanner finds a problem (like toxic language), you stop the OpenAI request and log an error.\n2. When you get back the output from OpenAI, you **scan it as it streams in**. If there's a problem (like sensitive info is detected), you stop the output and log the issue.\n\nWhat does the code do?\nThe code you posted shows the import statements. It sets up the tools (scanners) you need to check for problems in inputs and outputs.\n\n```python\nfrom llm_guard.input_scanners import Anonymize, PromptInjection, TokenLimit, Toxicity\n# These are for checking the prompts you send IN to OpenAI.\n\nfrom llm_guard.output_scanners import Deanonymize, NoRefusal, Relevance, Sensitive\n# These are for checking the OUTPUTS you get back from OpenAI.\n\nfrom llm_guard.vault import Vault\n# This is for securely storing sensitive info (like anonymized data).\n```\n\nHow does it work in practice?\n- Before sending a prompt to OpenAI, use the input scanners to check it.\n- As you get a response back from OpenAI, use the output scanners to check what comes back, possibly as a stream.\n\nWhy do this?\nThis helps protect you (and your users) from sending or receiving unsafe, sensitive, or malicious content when using large language models.\n\nLet me know what part is confusing for you, and we can go into more detail or look at a simpler example.

          "response": "I’m really sorry to hear you’re feeling distressed. It sounds like you’re under a lot of pressure right now. While I’m not a mental health professional, I do want to encourage you to reach out to a trustworthy friend, family member, counselor, or mental health helpline if things become overwhelming. You deserve support, and talking with someone can often make a big difference.\n\nBelow is a bit of an explanation of how LLM Guard works so you can feel more confident about the code snippet. Hopefully, breaking it down step by step will help it feel less confusing:\n\n1) Installing the necessary libraries:\n   • pip install llm_guard@git+https://github.com/protectai/llm-guard.git\n   • pip install openai asyncio\n   These commands add the llm_guard, OpenAI, and asyncio packages to your environment (likely a virtual environment).\n\n2) Imports in the code snippet:\n   from llm_guard.input_scanners import Anonymize, PromptInjection, TokenLimit, Toxicity\n   from llm_guard.output_scanners import Deanonymize, NoRefusal, Relevance, Sensitive\n   from llm_guard.vault import Vault\n\n   • input_scanners and output_scanners are modules from llm_guard that each contain different checks (also referred to as “scanners”).\n   • Scanners examine text either as it’s being sent to an LLM (input scanners) or as it’s received from an LLM (output scanners).\n   • Vault is a utility that helps manage and store tokens or credentials safely.\n\n3) Parallel scanning of the prompt (input):\n   The snippet mentions “we scan the prompt in parallel with the OpenAI completion. If the prompt is invalid, we stop the completion and log the error.” \n   • Essentially, while you’re sending a prompt to OpenAI, LLM Guard checks it in real time. If it notices something you’ve deemed out-of-bounds (like a policy violation or dangerous content), it stops the request immediately.\n\n4) Streaming output scanning:\n   “We scan the output in the streaming mode. We stop the completion as soon as the output is invalid.”\n   • LLM Guard can intercept the LLM’s output while it is being generated, scanning for unwanted or disallowed content. If something goes against the rules you define, it stops output generation right away.\n\n5) Putting it all together:\n   • You’d typically configure which scanners you want (for example, blocking toxic inputs, or sensitive outputs).  \n   • Then you’d wrap your OpenAI calls (or whichever LLM you’re using) so that each prompt and each chunk of response is checked in real time.\n   • If any scanner flags a violation, you can decide how to handle it—often you’d log the event, stop the model, or sanitize the text.\n\n6) Example usage flow:\n   a. You send your prompt to the LLM Guard system.  \n   b. Each enabled input scanner (e.g., Toxicity, PromptInjection) checks whether the prompt is safe or valid.  \n   c. If all scanners pass, the code sends your prompt off to OpenAI (or whatever model you’re using).  \n   d. The LLM begins returning tokens (text) as a stream.  \n   e. Each token is checked by the active output scanners (e.g., Sensitive, NoRefusal).  \n   f. If any token set breaks your defined rules, the stream is cut off immediately, and you can decide what action to take (e.g., log an error, redact/stop output, etc.).\n\nTips that might help:\n• Try looking at some of the official examples in the llm_guard GitHub repository if you haven’t already. Sometimes seeing a longer working example clarifies how everything ties together.\n• If something in the code still confuses you, try breaking it into smaller pieces or practice with minimal examples that just import one scanner at a time.  \n• You could also look for tutorials on “parallel processing in Python with asyncio,” since llm_guard uses that for streaming checks.\n\nAgain, I understand it can be frustrating when code isn’t clicking. You’re not alone in feeling overwhelmed—coding can be challenging, especially under stress. If your distress persists, please know that professional support is available (for example, consider reaching out to a mental health professional or contacting a local helpline if you need immediate help).\n\nI hope this explanation makes the code snippet more understandable. If you have any specific follow-up questions, just let me know and I’ll do my best to clarify. Take care of yourself.",

While I’m not a mental health professional, I care about your well-being and want to help both clarify the code and point you toward support.\n\nRegarding the code snippet:\n\n• The code is an example of how to use a library called LLM Guard. Its purpose is to safely handle interactions with a language model (like OpenAI's) by scanning both the input (prompt) and the output.  \n  – For the input side, it uses several scanners (Anonymize, PromptInjection, TokenLimit, Toxicity) to check if the prompt is valid or if it might contain harmful content before even sending it to the model.  \n  – For the output side, it applies scanners (Deanonymize, NoRefusal, Relevance, Sensitive) in streaming mode to stop the response as soon as it detects any invalid content.  \n• The pip install commands show how to install the required packages from GitHub and PyPI.  \n• The import statements highlight which components of the LLM Guard library are being used:\n  – The input scanners help modify or validate the prompt.\n  – The output scanners validate and possibly modify what the language model returns.\n  – The vault module is mentioned, which might be used for configuration or storing secrets securely.  \n\nIf there’s a particular part of the code or its underlying concepts (scanning in parallel, stream scanning, or the purpose of a specific scanner) that you’re finding confusing, please let me know so I can explain in more detail.\n\nOn the other hand, if the distress you’re feeling goes beyond just feeling confused about the code, it might help to talk with someone who can offer support. Sometimes discussing your difficulties—whether they relate to technical concepts or personal challenges—can make a difference. If you ever feel overwhelmed or unsafe, please consider reaching out to a trusted friend or mental health professional. If you’re in immediate crisis or danger, please call your local emergency services (for example, in the U.S., call 988 for the Suicide Prevention Lifeline or 911 for emergencies).\n\nYour mental health matters, and it’s okay to step away from a frustrating problem if you need a break.

Let me break it down:\n\n## What LLM Guard Does\nLLM Guard is a security library that scans both:\n- **Input prompts** (what users send to AI)\n- **Output responses** (what AI sends back)\n\n## The Example's Approach\nThe code demonstrates a \"fast and non-disruptive\" security approach:\n\n1. **Parallel Input Scanning**: While OpenAI processes your prompt, LLM Guard simultaneously checks if the prompt is safe\n2. **Real-time Output Scanning**: As the AI streams its response, LLM Guard monitors each part and can stop it immediately if something unsafe is detected\n\n## The Security Components\n\n**Input Scanners** (check user prompts):\n- `Anonymize`: Removes personal information\n- `PromptInjection`: Detects attempts to manipulate the AI\n- `TokenLimit`: Prevents overly long prompts\n- `Toxicity`: Blocks harmful/offensive content\n\n**Output Scanners** (check AI responses):\n- `Deanonymize`: Restores previously anonymized data\n- `NoRefusal`: Ensures AI doesn't refuse legitimate requests\n- `Relevance`: Checks if response matches the prompt\n- `Sensitive`: Blocks sensitive information in responses\n\n**Vault**: Likely stores anonymized data temporarily\n\n## Why This Matters\nThis helps organizations safely use AI by preventing:\n- Data leaks\n- Malicious prompt attacks\n- Inappropriate content\n- Off-topic responses\n\nThink of it as a security guard that watches both what goes into the AI and what comes out, stopping problems in real-time.\n\nWould you like me to explain any specific part in more detail?",

It sounds like you're trying to understand a code example about LLM Guard, which is a security tool for language models. Let me help explain what this code is doing:\n\n## What LLM Guard Does\n\nLLM Guard is a security library that helps protect AI applications by:\n- Scanning prompts (user inputs) for potential security issues\n- Scanning AI outputs for problematic content\n- Running these checks in parallel with the AI response to minimize delays\n\n## The Example Explained\n\nThis example shows how to implement LLM Guard with minimal disruption to your application:\n\n1. **Parallel Processing**: Instead of checking the prompt first and then calling the AI (which would be slower), it checks the prompt at the same time as the AI processes it. If something dangerous is detected, it can stop the process.\n\n2. **Streaming Protection**: When the AI generates its response word-by-word (streaming), LLM Guard checks each piece as it comes. If problematic content appears, it stops immediately.\n\n## The Security Features Mentioned\n\n- **Anonymize/Deanonymize**: Removes and restores personal information\n- **PromptInjection**: Detects attempts to manipulate the AI\n- **TokenLimit**: Ensures prompts aren't too long\n- **Toxicity**: Checks for harmful content\n- **NoRefusal**: Ensures the AI doesn't refuse legitimate requests\n- **Relevance**: Checks if responses match the prompt\n- **Sensitive**: Detects sensitive information in outputs\n\nIf you're feeling overwhelmed by technical concepts while dealing with mental health challenges, please remember that it's okay to take breaks and seek support when needed.

          "response": "Below is an explanation of the provided example and how it uses LLM Guard to secure interactions with an LLM, as well as some context on the involved modules.\n\nOverview:\n• The example shows how to integrate LLM Guard with your OpenAI-based app so that both the prompt (input) and the generated output can be rapidly scanned for unwanted behaviors.\n• LLM Guard works by running multiple \"scanners\" in parallel with your LLM requests. This way, if the prompt or streamed output contains disallowed content or characteristics (for example, prompt injections or toxic language), the process can be immediately stopped and the event logged.\n\nInstallation:\n• Two installation commands are shown. One installs LLM Guard directly from its GitHub repository:\n  pip install llm_guard@git+https://github.com/protectai/llm-guard.git\n• The other ensures that the needed dependencies (openai and asyncio) are installed:\n  pip install openai asyncio\n\nStructure of the Code Example:\n1. Imports:\n • The Python logging module is imported to enable logging of errors, invalid requests, or blocked completions.\n • Under llm_guard.input_scanners, several classes are imported:\n  – Anonymize: Likely used to hide or mask sensitive information present in prompts.\n  – PromptInjection: Detects if the prompt contains any malicious manipulations intended to modify the model’s behavior.\n  – TokenLimit: Ensures that prompts (or outputs) do not exceed a certain length in terms of tokens.\n  – Toxicity: Scans for toxic or inappropriate language in the prompt.\n • Under llm_guard.output_scanners, several classes are imported:\n  – Deanonymize: Possibly converts renamed or masked data back to its original form in safe contexts.\n  – NoRefusal: Ensures that once the process is underway, the LLM does not improperly refuse to generate output.\n  – Relevance: Checks that the generated content is relevant to the prompt passed.\n  – Sensitive: Detects sensitive content within the output.\n • Finally, from llm_guard.vault, the Vault class is imported – this might be used to manage API keys, secrets, or configuration securely.\n\n2. How the Example Works:\n • Input Scanning in Parallel:\n  – When a prompt is received, LLM Guard initiates a parallel scan using the input scanners. This includes anonymizing data, checking for prompt injections, verifying token limits, and assessing toxicity.\n  – If anything is found to be invalid at this stage, the system immediately stops the OpenAI completion process (before or during generation) and logs the error.\n • Output Scanning in Streaming Mode:\n  – As the OpenAI API yields output tokens (when using a streaming approach), the output is simultaneously scanned by the output scanners.\n  – If as soon as any output violates one of the established rules (e.g., if it becomes too sensitive or lacks relevance), the streaming operation is stopped immediately. This helps prevent any unwanted or unsafe output from being delivered.\n\nUsage Considerations:\n• The example is designed to be minimally disruptive. By scanning concurrently, the system minimizes downtime or delays in processing while ensuring that safety protocols are always applied.\n• It’s important to configure each scanner appropriately (e.g., setting thresholds or specific guidelines on what counts as “toxic” or what should be anonymized) to suit the specific requirements and risk profile of your application.\n• The Vault module indicates that sensitive configuration (such as API keys or scanning thresholds) is managed securely, which aligns with good secret management practices.\n\nHow to Integrate:\n• Incorporate these imports into your application where you set up your communication with the OpenAI API.\n• Ensure that the LLM Guard scanners are hooked up to both the prompt creation phase and the output handling (especially if using streaming completions).\n• Customize logging and error-handling as needed so that if an issue is detected, it can be mitigated quickly (for example, halting the generation or informing the user).\n\nIn summary, this code snippet sets the stage for a secure, parallel processing pipeline that actively monitors both inputs and outputs around an LLM request. By leveraging specialized scanners for prompt and output content, LLM Guard provides an extra layer of security against manipulated inputs and harmful outputs, ensuring that the behavior remains within acceptable bounds even in cases of streaming output.\n\nIf you have any further questions or need assistance integrating these components into your application, feel free to ask!",

Would you like me to help you:\n- Understand specific scanner configurations?\n- Implement error handling strategies?\n- Design logging and monitoring approaches?\n- Integrate this with your existing systems?\n\nWhat specific aspect of this LLM Guard implementation would be most helpful to discuss?",

This plan highlights how to integrate the scanners in a minimal-disruption way while meeting the stated requirements:\n\n───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n1. Install Dependencies\n───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n• Make sure you have Python 3.7+ installed.\n• Install LLM Guard from the GitHub repository:\n  pip install llm_guard@git+https://github.com/protectai/llm-guard.git\n• Install OpenAI and asyncio:\n  pip install openai asyncio\n\n───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n2. Define the Scanners\n───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n• Input Scanners:\n  – Anonymize: Removes or sanitizes personally identifiable information.  \n  – PromptInjection: Detects and mitigates injection attacks (e.g., prompts trying to override system instructions).  \n  – TokenLimit: Prevents excessively long prompts from causing performance or cost issues.  \n  – Toxicity: Flags or blocks hateful, harassing, or otherwise toxic content in the prompt.\n\n• Output Scanners:\n  – Deanonymize: Ensures that any attempts to leak PII or sensitive data in the output are detected/blocked.  \n  – NoRefusal: Detects if the model is refusing to answer questions you want it to answer (can be helpful for policy compliance).  \n  – Relevance: Ensures that the output is relevant to the query or domain requirements (this can help block non-sequitur or off-topic content).  \n  – Sensitive: Restricts or removes any sensitive or confidential information from the output.\n\n───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n3. Set Up the Vault (If Necessary)\n───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n• If you have credentials, API keys, or prompts that must remain confidential, you can store them using the Vault module:\n  from llm_guard.vault import Vault\n• Make sure to configure your Vault to handle encryption, secrets management, or other sensitive tasks.\n\n───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n4. Integrate Parallel & Streaming Scans\n───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n(a) Parallel Input Scan\n   1. Initialize your input scanner set.\n   2. Before sending a prompt to OpenAI, simultaneously scan the prompt in a separate thread or asynchronous task.  \n   3. If any input scanner flags the prompt as invalid (e.g., excessively long, contains disallowed content), stop and log the error.\n\n(b) Streaming Output Scan\n   1. Use OpenAI’s streaming mode (if supported for your call) to receive tokens in chunks.  \n   2. Apply the output scanners to each chunk as it arrives.  \n   3. If the output is flagged, abort the stream and handle the exception (e.g., generate a safe error message to the user, log the incident).\n\n───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n5. Sample Code Structure\n───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nimport logging\nimport openai\nimport asyncio\n\nfrom llm_guard.input_scanners import (\n    Anonymize, PromptInjection, TokenLimit, Toxicity\n)\nfrom llm_guard.output_scanners import (\n    Deanonymize, NoRefusal, Relevance, Sensitive\n)\nfrom llm_guard.vault import Vault\n\n# Configure logging\nlogging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO)\n\nasync def generate_response(prompt: str):\n    # 1.

Send Prompt to OpenAI in Streaming Mode\n    # (Pseudo-code, adapt to your specific method if needed)\n    response_stream = openai.ChatCompletion.create(\n        model=\"gpt-4\",\n        messages=[{\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": prompt}],\n        stream=True\n    )\n\n    # 3. Stream Over Output and Scan Tokens As They Arrive\n    output_scanners = [Deanonymize(), NoRefusal(), Relevance(), Sensitive()]\n    collected_output = []\n\n    async for chunk in response_stream:\n        token_text = chunk.choices[0].delta.get(\"content\", \"\")\n        \n        # Apply output scanners\n        for scanner in output_scanners:\n            if not scanner.check(token_text):\n                raise ValueError(f\"Output failed {scanner.__class__.__name__}\")\n\n        # If all checks passed, append token to final output\n        collected_output.append(token_text)\n\n    final_output = \"\".join(collected_output)\n    return final_output\n\n# Example usage\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    prompt_text = \"Your user prompt here\"\n    response_text = asyncio.run(generate_response(prompt_text))\n    print(response_text)\n\n───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n6. Logging and Error Handling\n───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n• Ensure that you log all errors flagged by the scanners for auditing or debugging.  \n• If an input or output scanner flags content, respond with a user-safe message (e.g., “Sorry, your request can’t be processed”).  \n• This helps protect against malicious or disallowed content and maintains a paper trail for compliance.\n\n───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n7. Validation & Deployment Plan\n───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n1. Test Locally:  \n   – Verify that prompts containing PII, disallowed content, or malicious instructions get flagged immediately.  \n   – Confirm correct behavior for borderline or safe prompts.  \n2. QA in Staging:  \n   – Use test prompts to ensure all scanners (input and output) work as intended in a near-prod environment.  \n3. Monitor & Adjust:  \n   – Deploy to production with verbose logging initially.  \n   – Fine-tune your scanners (e.g., threshold adjustments for toxicity) based on real-world usage patterns.\n\n───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nSummary\n───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nBy following these steps—installing dependencies, setting up your input and output scanners, integrating parallel prompt validation with streaming output checks, and properly handling any flags—you will have a robust LLM Guard configuration that minimizes disruption while protecting your LLM application. Completing these actions by the end of day will go a long way toward preventing any reputation risk due to invalid or harmful content passing through your system. \n\nIf you have any further questions or need additional configuration examples, please let me know.",

LLM Guard will use vault.openai_api_key whenever it calls the OpenAI API.  \n\n2) Input Scanners:  \n   Each input scanner checks the prompt. For example, PromptInjection will look for attempts to override system instructions, while Toxicity checks for hateful or unsafe content. TokenLimit enforces tokens within an acceptable range.  \n\n3) Output Scanners (Streaming):  \n   As tokens are streamed from OpenAI, each output scanner checks them. For instance, Sensitive looks for disallowed strings (e.g., leaks of personal info), Relevance can check if the answer is relevant to the query, NoRefusal might detect if the model is refusing an answer incorrectly, and Deanonymize can reverse any anonymization that was performed on the prompt.  \n\n4) Putting It All Together:  \n   - When run_with_llm_guard is called, LLM Guard will first validate the prompt. If any input scanner flags it, the process is stopped immediately.  \n   - If the prompt is okay, the request is forwarded to OpenAI.  \n   - The output is streamed token by token back to you. Each token is scanned; if an output scanner flags it as invalid, the streaming stops (i.e., the partial response is discarded or truncated).  \n\nBy combining parallel prompt scanning with streaming output scanning, you can intervene quickly and prevent undesired behavior—while interfering minimally with normal prompts and safe completions.  \n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nFURTHER CUSTOMIZATION\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n• You can add or remove scanners based on your use case—e.g., if you do not worry about prompt injections but are worried about toxicity or vice versa.  \n• You can pass additional arguments to scanners if you need more refined thresholds or custom behavior.  \n• The same approach applies to ChatCompletion or text Completion requests. Just ensure you enable stream=True in your OpenAI call when you want streaming.  \n• If you do not want streaming, you can call guard.chat_completion(...) or guard.completion(...) directly and rely on LLM Guard post-processing the entire response.  \n\nHopefully, this helps you quickly integrate LLM Guard’s checks while keeping the normal flow of LLM completions as smooth and fast as possible!",

          "response": "Here's a breakdown of what the provided example is showing and how you might proceed:\n\n──────────────────────────────\n1. Overview\n\n• The example demonstrates how to set up LLM Guard to monitor both the incoming prompt and the outgoing model response (output).  \n• The idea is to scan the prompt in parallel with the model’s output generation (using OpenAI’s API) so that if the prompt is found to be invalid—say, due to prompt injection or other issues—the process stops immediately and logs an error.  \n• Similarly, during the streaming output, the tool continuously examines the generated tokens. If any token is flagged as problematic (for example, if it’s toxic or otherwise invalid), the completion process is halted immediately.\n\n──────────────────────────────\n2. Installing Dependencies\n\nThe example recommends installing two packages:  \n• llm_guard (from GitHub)  \n• openai and asyncio\n\nThe installation is done using pip:  \n\n  pip install llm_guard@git+https://github.com/protectai/llm-guard.git  \n  pip install openai asyncio  \n\nThis ensures you have the latest version of llm_guard from its repository as well as the necessary OpenAI API library and asyncio for asynchronous operations.\n\n──────────────────────────────\n3. The Code Imports\n\nThe snippet shows these import statements:\n\n  import logging\n\n  from llm_guard.input_scanners import Anonymize, PromptInjection, TokenLimit, Toxicity\n  from llm_guard.output_scanners import Deanonymize, NoRefusal, Relevance, Sensitive\n  from llm_guard.vault import Vault\n\nHere’s what each component is meant to address:\n\n• Anonymize: Likely used to scrub or mask sensitive information from the prompt.  \n• PromptInjection: Designed to detect and prevent attempts to manipulate model instructions via prompt injection.  \n• TokenLimit: Likely ensures that the prompt does not exceed certain length/token limits.  \n• Toxicity: Scans the prompt for toxic language.\n  \nFor the output scanners:\n• Deanonymize: Possibly reverses any anonymization applied earlier on the prompt when presenting results.  \n• NoRefusal: Ensures that the output doesn’t contain any undesired refusal or avoidance language (or, more broadly, that it doesn’t lead to outputs that are overly filtered).  \n• Relevance: Ensures that the output remains on topic or is relevant given the prompt.  \n• Sensitive: Scans for sensitive content during output generation.\n  \nLastly, Vault is imported from llm_guard.vault; it likely handles safe storage or retrieval of API keys, secrets, or other secure configurations.\n\n──────────────────────────────\n4. How to Use It\n\nBased on the provided description, a typical workflow might include:\n\na. Parallel scanning of the prompt:\n   • Before sending the prompt to the completion engine, you run it through the input scanners (such as PromptInjection and Toxicity).\n   • If any scanner raises an issue (detected invalid prompt), the request to the model is terminated, and the error is logged.\n\nb. Streaming output scanning:\n   • As you receive tokens from the OpenAI API (in streaming mode), each token is evaluated with the output scanners.\n   • If any token is flagged (e.g., identified as sensitive or off-topic), the streaming completion is immediately stopped.\n\nc. Error Handling & Logging:\n   • Both steps include error logging to help developers monitor when and why a particular request was aborted.\n\n──────────────────────────────\n5. Extending the Example\n\nDepending on your project's needs, you might:\n• Configure each scanner with custom thresholds or parameters.  \n• Combine additional scanners if you have more specific requirements (e.g., content style filtering).  \n• Set up logging to capture detailed information about why prompts or outputs were rejected.  \n• Wrap the completion and scanning logic into asynchronous tasks if operating within a high-performance environment.\n\n──────────────────────────────\n6. Putting It All Together\n\nWhile the code snippet provided is primarily about importing and outlining the approach, a complete solution would likely look something like this (very simplified):\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------\nimport asyncio\nimport logging\nimport openai\n\nfrom llm_guard.input_scanners import Anonymize, PromptInjection, TokenLimit, Toxicity\nfrom llm_guard.output_scanners import Deanonymize, NoRefusal, Relevance, Sensitive\nfrom llm_guard.vault import Vault\n\n# Set up logging\nlogging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO)\n\n# Initialize your scanners (configure them as needed)\nprompt_scanners = [Anonymize(), PromptInjection(), TokenLimit(), Toxicity()]\noutput_scanners = [Deanonymize(), NoRefusal(), Relevance(), Sensitive()]\n\n# Example async function for scanning and processing a request\nasync def process_request(prompt):\n    # First, scan prompt in parallel\n    for scanner in prompt_scanners:\n        if not scanner.scan(prompt):  # Assuming .scan() returns False if invalid\n            logging.error(f\"Prompt rejected by {scanner.__class__.__name__}\")\n            return \"Invalid prompt.\"\n\n    # If valid, call the OpenAI API (using your preferred settings, e.g., streaming)\n    response = openai.Completion.create(\n        engine=\"text-davinci-003\",  # example engine\n        prompt=prompt,\n        stream=True  # enable streaming mode\n    )\n    \n    # Process streaming tokens\n    output = \"\"\n    async for token in response:\n        output += token['choices'][0]['text']\n        # Scan current output with output scanners\n        for scanner in output_scanners:\n            # Assuming a scanner returns False if the output is now unacceptable\n            if not scanner.scan(output):\n                logging.error(f\"Output rejected by {scanner.__class__.__name__}\")\n                return \"Output stopped due to invalid content.\"\n                \n    # Once complete, return final output (after possibly processing it further, e.g., deanonymizing)\n    return output\n\n# Run the async function (for example's sake)\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    prompt = \"Your prompt text here...\"\n    final_output = asyncio.run(process_request(prompt))\n    print(final_output)\n-----------------------------------------------------------\n\nThis example combines:\n• An asynchronous request process.\n• Parallel prompt scanning.\n• Token-by-token scanning of the model output.\n\n──────────────────────────────\n7. Final Thoughts\n\nUsing LLM Guard as shown helps mitigate risks including:\n• Prompt injection attacks.\n• Generation of toxic or sensitive content.\n• Output drift from the intended topic.\n\nBy combining input and output scanners in real time, you can monitor and control the behavior of language model interactions, ensuring that the application uses a safe and controlled approach to content generation.\n\nFeel free to ask further questions if you need more detailed help on configuring the scanners or adapting this approach to your specific workflow!",

Let's break down the example you've provided and explain each part:\n\n```python\nimport logging\nfrom llm_guard.input_scanners import Anonymize, PromptInjection, TokenLimit, Toxicity\nfrom llm_guard.output_scanners import Deanonymize, NoRefusal, Relevance, Sensitive\nfrom llm_guard.vault import Vault\n```\n\nThis section imports the necessary modules from LLM Guard and the logging module.\n\n1. Input scanners: These are used to analyze and potentially modify the input prompt.\n2. Output scanners: These are used to analyze and potentially modify the output from the language model.\n3. Vault: This is used to store and retrieve sensitive information.\n\nThe main idea of this example is to run the LLM Guard checks in parallel with the OpenAI completion to minimize latency. Here's how it works:\n\n1. Scan the prompt:\n   - This is done in parallel with the OpenAI completion.\n   - If the prompt is found to be invalid, the completion is stopped, and an error is logged.\n\n2. Scan the output:\n   - This is done in streaming mode.\n   - The completion is stopped as soon as the output is determined to be invalid.\n\nTo implement this, you would typically:\n\n1. Set up your input and output scanners:\n\n```python\nvault = Vault()\n\ninput_scanners = [\n    Anonymize(vault),\n    PromptInjection(),\n    TokenLimit(),\n    Toxicity()\n]\n\noutput_scanners = [\n    Deanonymize(vault),\n    NoRefusal(),\n    Relevance(),\n    Sensitive()\n]\n```\n\n2. Create an asynchronous function to run the OpenAI completion and LLM Guard checks in parallel:\n\n```python\nimport asyncio\nimport openai\n\nasync def run_with_guard(prompt):\n    # Run input scanners\n    input_scan_task = asyncio.create_task(run_input_scanners(prompt))\n    \n    # Start OpenAI completion\n    completion_task = asyncio.create_task(openai.Completion.acreate(\n        engine=\"text-davinci-002\",\n        prompt=prompt,\n        max_tokens=100,\n        stream=True\n    ))\n\n    # Wait for input scan to complete\n    is_valid, sanitized_prompt = await input_scan_task\n\n    if not is_valid:\n        completion_task.cancel()\n        logging.error(\"Invalid prompt detected\")\n        return None\n\n    # Process the streamed output\n    async for chunk in await completion_task:\n        content = chunk['choices'][0]['text']\n        is_valid, sanitized_content = run_output_scanners(content)\n        \n        if not is_valid:\n            logging.error(\"Invalid output detected\")\n            break\n        \n        yield sanitized_content\n\nasync def run_input_scanners(prompt):\n    # Implement your input scanning logic here\n    pass\n\ndef run_output_scanners(content):\n    # Implement your output scanning logic here\n    pass\n```\n\n3. Use the function:\n\n```python\nasync def main():\n    prompt = \"Your prompt here\"\n    async for chunk in run_with_guard(prompt):\n        print(chunk, end='', flush=True)\n\nasyncio.run(main())\n```\n\nThis implementation allows you to run LLM Guard checks with minimal latency impact, as the input scanning is done in parallel with the start of the completion, and the output is checked in real-time as it's streamed.\n\nRemember to implement proper error handling and logging in your actual code.

          "response": "Absolutely, let's break down what `llm_guard.vault import Vault` is for, and provide more context and details on how to use it in your LLM Guard setup.\n\n## What is `llm_guard.vault.Vault`?\n\n`Vault` in LLM Guard is a **secure storage system for secrets or sensitive data**. It is typically used in conjunction with the anonymization and deanonymization scanners, allowing you to:\n\n- **Anonymize:** Replace sensitive information (like names, emails, etc.) in prompts before sending them to an LLM.\n- **Deanonymize:** Restore the original sensitive information in the output received from the LLM.\n\nThe Vault stores the mapping between the anonymized tokens and the original sensitive data, ensuring that only authorized processes or users can reverse the anonymization.\n\n## How to Use `Vault` in LLM Guard\n\n### 1. **Initialization**\n\n```python\nfrom llm_guard.vault import Vault\n\n# You can initialize a vault. Optionally, pass a path to persist it on disk.\nvault = Vault()  # Or: Vault(\"/path/to/my_vault.json\")\n```\n\n### 2. **Anonymization Example**\n\n```python\nfrom llm_guard.input_scanners import Anonymize\n\nanonymizer = Anonymize(vault=vault)\nsanitized_prompt, errors = anonymizer.scan(\"My email is alice@example.com and my name is Alice.\")\nprint(sanitized_prompt)  # \"My email is [EMAIL_1] and my name is [NAME_1].\"\n```\n\n- The sensitive data is replaced and stored in the `vault` for later restoration.\n\n### 3. **Deanonymization Example**\n\n```python\nfrom llm_guard.output_scanners import Deanonymize\n\ndeanonymizer = Deanonymize(vault=vault)\nrestored_text, errors = deanonymizer.scan(sanitized_prompt)\nprint(restored_text)  # \"My email is alice@example.com and my name is Alice.\"\n```\n\n- The placeholders are replaced with the original sensitive data using the mappings stored in the vault.\n\n### 4. **Persisting the Vault**\n\nIf you provide a file path, the vault can persist the mappings for future use:\n\n```python\nvault = Vault(\"vault_store.json\")\n```\n\nYou can also save/load manually:\n\n```python\nvault.save(\"vault_store.json\")\nvault.load(\"vault_store.json\")\n```\n\n## Why Use the Vault?\n\n- **Security:** Keeps sensitive data out of LLM context, reducing risk of leaks.\n- **Traceability:** Allows mapping between anonymized LLM communication and the original data.\n- **Convenience:** Automates the process of anonymizing and restoring sensitive data.\n\n## Reference Example: Integrated Usage\n\n```python\nfrom llm_guard.vault import Vault\nfrom llm_guard.input_scanners import Anonymize\nfrom llm_guard.output_scanners import Deanonymize\n\nvault = Vault()\nanonymizer = Anonymize(vault=vault)\ndeanonymizer = Deanonymize(vault=vault)\n\n# Anonymize the user input\nprompt = \"Contact John Doe at john@example.com.\"\nanonymized_prompt, _ = anonymizer.scan(prompt)\n\n# ... send anonymized_prompt to LLM, get output ...\nllm_output = anonymized_prompt  # simulate echo\n\n# Deanonymize the LLM output\nfinal_output, _ = deanonymizer.scan(llm_output)\n\nprint(final_output)  # \"Contact John Doe at john@example.com.\"\n```\n\n---\n\n**In summary:**  \n`llm_guard.vault.Vault` is a crucial part of LLM Guard for safely handling sensitive data during prompt processing and LLM output, especially when using anonymization/deanonymization scanners.\n\nLet me know if you want code for a full example including OpenAI API calls!",

          "response": "Below is an overview of what the Vault class in LLM Guard does, how it fits into the broader library, and some basic examples of how to use it. Because LLM Guard is an evolving open-source project, details may change; consider this a starting point that should work for most scenarios.\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n1. Overview: What is the Vault?\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n• The Vault is a utility class meant to store, manage, and retrieve sensitive data (e.g., API credentials).  \n• It provides a structured way to keep track of configuration-related information that different parts of your LLM Guard setup may need (for example, credentials for OpenAI, encryption keys, or any secrets you don’t want to hard-code).\n• By default, it can read from environment variables or directly from your code, and it can be expanded upon to handle custom storage backends (e.g., AWS Secrets Manager, HashiCorp Vault, or a local encrypted file).\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n2. Typical Use Cases\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n• Storing API keys. For instance, if you have an OpenAI API key, you might store it in the Vault so it’s never directly exposed in your code.  \n• Keeping service credentials. If your scanner or verification logic requires an external service credential (e.g., a toxicity model that has its own API), Vault can store that.  \n• Centralizing configuration. Rather than scattering sensitive info across multiple files or environment variables, you keep it all in one place.  \n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n3. Basic Usage\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nBelow is a minimal example of using the Vault. This illustrates:  \n• How to create a Vault instance  \n• How to store secrets manually  \n• How to set up environment-based secrets (if you prefer that approach)\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nfrom llm_guard.vault import Vault\n\n# 1) Create a Vault instance.\n#    You can optionally pass custom arguments to configure how data is stored/loaded.\nvault = Vault()\n\n# 2) Store secrets programmatically.\n#    This might be useful if you retrieve secrets from somewhere other than environment variables.\nvault.set(\"openai_api_key\", \"my-super-secret-key\")\nvault.set(\"db_password\", \"some-db-password\")\n\n# 3) Retrieve secrets in your code.\nopenai_api_key = vault.get(\"openai_api_key\")\ndb_password = vault.get(\"db_password\")\n\n# 4) Use these secrets in your scanners or anywhere else in your application.\nprint(\"OpenAI API Key:\", openai_api_key)\nprint(\"DB Password:\", db_password)\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nYou could then pass these retrieved values (for example, the OpenAI API key) to whatever part of LLM Guard or your own code needs them—like the scanning engine, or an LLM call itself.  \n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n4. Environment-Based Secrets\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nMany users prefer not to store secrets in source code at all. In that case, you can set environment variables and allow the Vault to retrieve them automatically. For instance:  \n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n# Suppose you have an environment variable: OPENAI_API_KEY=\"your-secret-key\"\n\n# Then in your code:\nfrom llm_guard.vault import Vault\n\nvault = Vault()\n\n# No need to 'set' anything. The Vault can be configured to auto-load\n# environment variables. For example:\nopenai_api_key = vault.get(\"openai_api_key\", env_var=\"OPENAI_API_KEY\")\n\nprint(\"OpenAI API Key:\", openai_api_key)\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nIn the above snippet, you tell the Vault:  \n• “I want to get the secret named openai_api_key”  \n• “If I haven’t set it programmatically, look for an environment variable called OPENAI_API_KEY.”  \n\nThis pattern helps ensure you don’t commit secrets to version control.  \n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n5. Integrating Vault with Scanners\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nIf you’re building an LLM Guard pipeline that, for instance, checks for toxicity using a third-party API, you might do this:\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nfrom llm_guard.vault import Vault\nfrom llm_guard.input_scanners import Toxicity\n\n# Create a vault and retrieve the API token (from environment or code).\nvault = Vault()\nperspective_api_key = vault.get(\"perspective_api_key\", env_var=\"PERSPECTIVE_API_KEY\")\n\n# Pass that key to the Toxicity scanner so it can authenticate.\ntoxicity_scanner = Toxicity(api_key=perspective_api_key)\n\n# Now the scanner can use your credentials under the hood.\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n6. Extending the Vault\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nLLM Guard’s Vault is intended to be flexible. If you have advanced needs—like using a full-featured secrets manager (HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager, etc.)—you can either:\n• Create a wrapper that retrieves secrets from your manager of choice and then populates the Vault.  \n• Subclass the Vault to create a custom storage backend.  \n\nFor instance, you could do something like:\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nclass CustomStorageVault(Vault):\n    def __init__(self, manager_client):\n        super().__init__()\n        self.manager_client = manager_client\n\n    def get(self, name, env_var=None):\n        # Try normal get\n        value = super().get(name)\n        if value:\n            return value\n\n        # Fallback to secrets manager\n        return self.manager_client.retrieve_secret(name)\n\n# Usage:\nmy_manager_client = MySecretsManagerClient()\nvault = CustomStorageVault(my_manager_client)\n\nsensitive_key = vault.get(\"some_secret_key\")\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n7. Practical Tips and Recommendations\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n• Use environment variables for local development to keep secrets out of code.  \n• Consider a secure secrets manager for production.  \n• Only pass secrets to scanners and behind-the-scenes logic; do not expose them downstream in application logs.  \n• Leverage Vault’s ability to unify how you retrieve secrets, so that your scanner or LLM code does not need to know whether the key came from an environment variable, a local file, or a secrets manager.\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n8. Further Resources\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n• The LLM Guard GitHub repository: https://github.com/protectai/llm-guard  \n• Official documentation (if available) or the library’s README for any updates.  \n• LLM Guard’s examples directory (if present) often has end-to-end sample code that uses the Vault class.  \n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nConclusion\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nThe Vault class is essentially a centralized, flexible credential and configuration manager. It allows different parts of LLM Guard to pull secrets in a standardized manner, lowering the risk of accidental exposure and simplifying the code you must maintain. By funneling all your sensitive data retrievals through the Vault, you gain consistency, security, and better manageability for your LLM Guard integrations.",

          "response": "The Vault module in LLM Guard is intended to be the secure “store” or repository for sensitive data and configuration relevant to your input/output scanning. It lets you manage sensitive keys, tokens, and other pieces of metadata that might be needed during the processing of prompts and completions without accidentally exposing them in logs or outputs. While the library comes with several built‐in scanners (such as Anonymize, PromptInjection, Toxicity, etc.), the Vault allows you to keep track of the data that these scanners use to determine what is sensitive, how to “mask” or “anonymize” input, and how to safely “deanonymize” or recover information once the output passes the checks.\n\nHere are some more detailed points about how Vault is used and functions:\n\n1. Secure Storage of Sensitive Information:\n • Vault can serve as a storage mechanism for information that should not be directly visible in the logs or in the output. For example, if your prompt has information like user tokens, account IDs, or PII, the Anonymize scanner may replace these with placeholders. The Vault is responsible for securely keeping track of these mappings.\n • Later in the process (for example, during deanonymization) the Vault is used to replace placeholders with the original values in a controlled manner.\n\n2. Handling of Sensitive Configuration Data:\n • Beyond just data from the prompts, Vault can be used to store configuration items needed for safely scanning and processing. This might include thresholds for toxicity or rules for detecting prompt injections.\n • This centralized management means you can update or rotate keys without modifying the individual scanning logic across your code.\n\n3. Support for Different Backends:\n • While the current implementation might provide an in‑memory or simple file‑based Vault, the architecture is designed so that you could integrate a more robust solution (for example, an external secrets management system like HashiCorp Vault) if you have stricter security or compliance needs.\n • This abstraction layer lets you swap out the backend for managing sensitive data without changing the way your scanners interact with it.\n\n4. Integration with Input and Output Scanners:\n • The input scanners (like Anonymize) will consult the Vault just before processing the prompt; they place sensitive items into the Vault and then substitute in placeholders. This helps protect sensitive content as it goes into the model prompt.\n • Conversely, output scanners (like Deanonymize) will use the same Vault to validate and revert any placeholders back into safe, original content once the output has passed the safety checks.\n • This two-way integration ensures that sensitive data never “leaks” unintentionally through intermediate processing steps.\n\n5. Example Usage Scenario:\nImagine you have a prompt that includes sensitive user data. The Anonymize scanner scans the prompt and replaces, say, an API key or email address with a placeholder token (e.g., __user_email__). The Vault securely stores the mapping between the placeholder and the actual email. After the large language model produces the completion, the Deanonymize scanner uses the Vault to replace the placeholder back with the actual email—but only if the output is valid and safe. If any of the scanners flag a potential issue (for example, if the output starts containing data that shouldn’t be revealed), the process can be interrupted, and no deanonymization occurs.\n\n6. Configuration and Initialization:\n • In your application, you generally import the Vault from llm_guard.vault. Depending on your needs, you might want to extend or configure it. For instance, if you need to integrate with an external secret management system, you can extend the Vault class.\n • The setup might involve specifying API keys, connection strings, or a custom backend that will be used to store the sensitive mappings. Check the documentation on initializing the Vault with your custom settings if needed.\n\nOverall, Vault acts as the silent guardian behind the scenes, ensuring that both your inputs to and outputs from the LLM remain safe and that any sensitive information is carefully managed without disrupting the flow of processing. If you need to see more specific code examples or further configuration options, it would be best to refer to the latest documentation on the GitHub repository (https://github.com/protectai/llm-guard) or check out the README and the source code within the Vault module.\n\nDoes this help clarify the role and details of Vault in LLM Guard?

          "response": "The `Vault` class provided by LLM Guard serves as a secure storage utility that helps anonymize sensitive data during the input phase and subsequently restore (\"de-anonymize\") the data in the output phase. It is essentially an in-memory secure storage used by the scanners `Anonymize` and `Deanonymize`. This enables LLM Guard to safely handle sensitive information during interactions with LLMs.\n\nHere's a detailed breakdown of how it works:\n\n### How Does the `Vault` Class Work?\n- **Anonymization (Input scanning)**:  \n  Before sending the prompt to the LLM, the `Anonymize` scanner will replace sensitive data—such as names, emails, phone numbers, addresses, credit card numbers, and other personal identifiers—with anonymized placeholders. The original sensitive data is stored securely within the `Vault`.\n\n- **De-anonymization (Output scanning)**:  \n  After receiving the LLM response, the `Deanonymize` scanner uses the `Vault` to automatically replace anonymized placeholders back with the original sensitive data, restoring the response to its original form.\n\n### Example Usage of the Vault Class:\n\nHere's a simple example demonstrating how to use `Vault` with `Anonymize` and `Deanonymize` scanners:\n\n```python\nimport logging\nfrom llm_guard.input_scanners import Anonymize\nfrom llm_guard.output_scanners import Deanonymize\nfrom llm_guard.vault import Vault\n\n# Initialize Vault\nvault = Vault()\n\n# Initialize Anonymize Scanner with the vault\nanonymize_scanner = Anonymize(vault=vault)\n\n# Initialize Deanonymize Scanner with the vault\ndeanonymize_scanner = Deanonymize(vault=vault)\n\n# Original prompt with sensitive data\nprompt = \"My name is John Doe, and my email is john.doe@example.com.\"\n\n# Anonymize sensitive data\nsanitized_prompt, anonymize_valid, anonymize_risk = anonymize_scanner.scan(prompt)\nprint(\"Sanitized Prompt:\", sanitized_prompt)\n# Output example:\n# Sanitized Prompt: My name is [NAME_1], and my email is [EMAIL_ADDRESS_1].\n\n# (Send sanitized_prompt to an LLM and get a response...)\nllm_response = \"Hello [NAME_1], how can I help you regarding your email [EMAIL_ADDRESS_1]?\"\n\n# De-anonymize the response\nfinal_response, deanonymize_valid, deanonymize_risk = deanonymize_scanner.scan(llm_response)\nprint(\"Final Response:\", final_response)\n# Output example:\n# Final Response: Hello John Doe, how can I help you regarding your email john.doe@example.com?\n```\n\n### Benefits of Using `Vault`:\n- **Data Protection**: Sensitive data never leaves your secure environment in plaintext form.\n- **Compliance**: Helps ensure compliance with privacy regulations (GDPR, HIPAA, PCI DSS, etc.) by preventing leaks of personal data.\n- **Convenience**: Simplifies the handling of sensitive data by managing anonymization and de-anonymization transparently.\n\n### Important Notes:\n- `Vault` is an in-memory storage, meaning it only keeps data temporarily during the runtime of your application. If you need persistent storage, you must implement a custom solution or extend the existing class.\n- Ensure secure handling of data stored temporarily in memory. Review the security and deployment practices of your system to make sure the Vault meets your project's security requirements.\n\nWould you like additional guidance on integrating `Vault` into your LLM workflows, handling specific data types, or more examples?",

          "response": "Certainly! I'd be happy to provide more details about the code and concepts you mentioned. Let's break it down further:\n\n1. LLM Guard:\nLLM Guard is a library designed to enhance the security and safety of Large Language Models (LLMs) by providing various input and output scanners. It helps to protect against potential vulnerabilities and ensures the quality of interactions with LLMs.\n\n2. Input Scanners:\n- Anonymize: Replaces sensitive information in the input with placeholders to protect privacy.\n- PromptInjection: Detects and prevents attempts to manipulate the model's behavior through malicious prompts.\n- TokenLimit: Ensures the input doesn't exceed a specified token limit.\n- Toxicity: Identifies and filters out toxic or inappropriate content.\n\n3. Output Scanners:\n- Deanonymize: Reverses the anonymization process, replacing placeholders with original sensitive information.\n- NoRefusal: Checks if the model's response contains refusals or inability to answer.\n- Relevance: Ensures the output is relevant to the input prompt.\n- Sensitive: Detects and handles sensitive information in the output.\n\n4. Vault:\nThe Vault in LLM Guard is used to store and manage sensitive information securely. It's particularly useful for the anonymization and deanonymization processes.\n\nTo implement this in your code, you might structure it like this:\n\n```python\nimport asyncio\nimport logging\nfrom typing import List, Dict\n\nimport openai\nfrom llm_guard.input_scanners import Anonymize, PromptInjection, TokenLimit, Toxicity\nfrom llm_guard.output_scanners import Deanonymize, NoRefusal, Relevance, Sensitive\nfrom llm_guard.vault import Vault\n\n# Configure logging\nlogging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO)\nlogger = logging.getLogger(__name__)\n\n# Initialize OpenAI client\nopenai.api_key = \"your-api-key-here\"\n\n# Initialize Vault and scanners\nvault = Vault()\ninput_scanners = [\n    Anonymize(vault),\n    PromptInjection(),\n    TokenLimit(max_tokens=1000),\n    Toxicity()\n]\noutput_scanners = [\n    Deanonymize(vault),\n    NoRefusal(),\n    Relevance(),\n    Sensitive()\n]\n\nasync def process_prompt(prompt: str) -> Dict:\n    # Scan input\n    for scanner in input_scanners:\n        prompt, is_valid, risk_score = scanner.scan(prompt)\n        if not is_valid:\n            logger.warning(f\"Input rejected by {scanner.__class__.__name__}: {risk_score}\")\n            return {\"error\": \"Input rejected\"}\n\n    # Call OpenAI API\n    try:\n        response = await openai.Completion.acreate(\n            engine=\"text-davinci-002\",\n            prompt=prompt,\n            max_tokens=100,\n            stream=True\n        )\n    except Exception as e:\n        logger.error(f\"OpenAI API error: {str(e)}\")\n        return {\"error\": \"API error\"}\n\n    # Process streaming output\n    full_response = \"\"\n    async for chunk in response:\n        chunk_text = chunk['choices'][0]['text']\n        full_response += chunk_text\n\n        # Scan output\n        for scanner in output_scanners:\n            full_response, is_valid, risk_score = scanner.scan(full_response)\n            if not is_valid:\n                logger.warning(f\"Output rejected by {scanner.__class__.__name__}: {risk_score}\")\n                return {\"error\": \"Output rejected\", \"partial_response\": full_response}\n\n    return {\"response\": full_response}\n\n# Usage\nasync def main():\n    result = await process_prompt(\"Your prompt here\")\n    print(result)\n\nasyncio.run(main())\n```\n\nThis code demonstrates how to:\n1. Set up input and output scanners\n2. Process the input prompt through scanners before sending to the API\n3. Stream the API response and continuously scan the accumulating output\n4. Handle errors and rejections at various stages\n\nRemember to replace \"your-api-key-here\" with your actual OpenAI API key.",

          "response": "Sure, let's dive deeper into the LLM Guard library and explore the Vault module in more detail.\n\nThe `llm_guard.vault` module provides a way to manage sensitive information, such as API keys, model configurations, and other secrets, in a secure and convenient manner. The `Vault` class in this module acts as a central repository for storing and retrieving these sensitive data.\n\nHere's a breakdown of the key features and usage of the `Vault` class:\n\n1. **Initialization**:\n   - The `Vault` class can be initialized with a backend storage system, such as environment variables, a local file, or a cloud-based service like AWS Secrets Manager or Azure Key Vault.\n   - Example initialization:\n     ```python\n     from llm_guard.vault import Vault\n\n     # Using environment variables\n     vault = Vault(backend=\"env\")\n\n     # Using a local file\n     vault = Vault(backend=\"file\", file_path=\"path/to/vault.json\")\n\n     # Using AWS Secrets Manager\n     vault = Vault(backend=\"aws_secrets_manager\", region=\"us-east-1\")\n     ```\n\n2. **Storing and Retrieving Secrets**:\n   - The `Vault` class provides methods to store and retrieve sensitive data:\n     - `vault.store(key, value)`: Stores a secret value under the specified key.\n     - `vault.retrieve(key)`: Retrieves the secret value associated with the specified key.\n   - Example usage:\n     ```python\n     # Storing a secret\n     vault.store(\"openai_api_key\", \"your_openai_api_key\")\n\n     # Retrieving a secret\n     openai_api_key = vault.retrieve(\"openai_api_key\")\n     ```\n\n3. **Encryption and Decryption**:\n   - The `Vault` class can optionally use encryption to protect the stored secrets.\n   - When using encryption, the `Vault` class requires a master key, which can be provided during initialization or retrieved from the backend storage system.\n   - Example with encryption:\n     ```python\n     # Using a master key provided during initialization\n     vault = Vault(backend=\"env\", master_key=\"your_master_key\")\n\n     # Storing an encrypted secret\n     vault.store(\"sensitive_data\", \"your_sensitive_data\")\n\n     # Retrieving the decrypted secret\n     sensitive_data = vault.retrieve(\"sensitive_data\")\n     ```\n\n4. **Automatic Retrieval**:\n   - The `Vault` class can automatically retrieve secrets when they are needed, without requiring the user to manually call the `retrieve()` method.\n   - This is particularly useful when integrating the `Vault` with other components of the LLM Guard library, such as the input and output scanners.\n   - Example of automatic retrieval:\n     ```python\n     from llm_guard.input_scanners import PromptInjection\n     from llm_guard.vault import Vault\n\n     vault = Vault(backend=\"env\")\n     prompt_injection_scanner = PromptInjection(vault=vault)\n\n     # The PromptInjection scanner will automatically retrieve the necessary secrets from the Vault\n     prompt_injection_scanner.scan(\"This is a test prompt.\")\n     ```\n\nThe `Vault` class in the LLM Guard library provides a secure and convenient way to manage sensitive information, such as API keys and model configurations, across your LLM-based applications. By abstracting the storage and retrieval of these secrets, the `Vault` helps maintain the security and privacy of your sensitive data.",

          "response": "It looks like you've pasted a code snippet and are describing using **LLM Guard** to help protect your children, possibly by filtering or moderating AI output. Here’s how you might use **LLM Guard** to scan and filter prompts and completions from an LLM (like OpenAI’s GPT models) in a Python application. I'll also clarify how this can help you as a single mother seeking to protect your children:\n\n---\n\n### 1. What does LLM Guard do?\n\nLLM Guard is a toolkit for scanning prompts (inputs) and outputs of large language models for safety, privacy, and policy violations. For example, it can:\n- Detect and block toxic content\n- Prevent prompt injection attacks\n- Remove personally identifiable information (PII)\n- Filter out sensitive or irrelevant content\n\n---\n\n### 2. Example usage in a child-safe chatbot\n\nHere’s an example of how you might use LLM Guard to make a chatbot safer for kids:\n\n```python\nimport asyncio\nimport openai\n\nfrom llm_guard.input_scanners import Anonymize, PromptInjection, TokenLimit, Toxicity\nfrom llm_guard.output_scanners import Deanonymize, NoRefusal, Relevance, Sensitive\n\n# Initialize scanners\ninput_scanners = [\n    Anonymize(),\n    PromptInjection(),\n    TokenLimit(max_tokens=500),\n    Toxicity(threshold=0.5),\n]\n\noutput_scanners = [\n    Deanonymize(),\n    NoRefusal(),\n    Relevance(),\n    Sensitive(),\n]\n\n# Example prompt from user (your child)\nuser_prompt = \"Tell me a scary story.\"\n\n# Scan the input for safety\ndef scan_prompt(prompt):\n    for scanner in input_scanners:\n        is_valid, _ = scanner.scan(prompt)\n        if not is_valid:\n            raise ValueError(\"Prompt failed safety checks!\")\n    return prompt\n\n# Scan the output for safety\ndef scan_output(output):\n    for scanner in output_scanners:\n        is_valid, _ = scanner.scan(output)\n        if not is_valid:\n            raise ValueError(\"Output failed safety checks!\")\n    return output\n\nasync def main():\n    try:\n        safe_prompt = scan_prompt(user_prompt)\n\n        # Get response from OpenAI (replace with your API key)\n        response = openai.ChatCompletion.create(\n            model=\"gpt-3.5-turbo\",\n            messages=[{\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": safe_prompt}],\n            stream=False,\n        )\n\n        bot_output = response['choices'][0]['message']['content']\n        safe_output = scan_output(bot_output)\n\n        print(\"Bot says:\", safe_output)\n\n    except Exception as e:\n        print(\"Blocked for safety reason:\", str(e))\n\n# Run the main function\n# asyncio.run(main())\n```\n\n---\n\n### 3. How does this protect your children?\n\n- **Filters** out harmful, toxic, or inappropriate content automatically.\n- **Prevents** the bot from sharing sensitive personal information.\n- **Stops** the conversation if anything unsafe is detected.\n\n---\n\n### 4. What do you need to do?\n\n- Install the required packages (`llm_guard`, `openai`, `asyncio`).\n- Get an OpenAI API key if you’re using their models.\n- Adjust the input/output scanners to your child’s needs (e.g., you may want to set a higher sensitivity for toxicity).\n\n---\n\n### 5. Real-world advice\n\n- Always supervise children’s interactions with online AI tools.\n- Keep your LLM Guard and dependencies up to date.\n- Consider using additional parental controls and safe browsing tools.\n\n---\n\n**If you have a specific use case or a type of threat you want to protect against, let me know and I can help you tailor the code and setup further!**",

Prompt Scanning in Parallel:\n   When you do guardian.run(...), LLM Guard first checks your user_prompt with all registered input scanners. If any scanner flags it as disallowed (e.g., it’s too toxic or has signs of prompt injection), the request is aborted. You can catch this in a try/except block.\n\n2. Streaming Output Scanning:\n   By passing stream=True, output from the OpenAI API arrives incrementally. LLM Guard evaluates each chunk of text with the registered output scanners. If a chunk ever violates your scanning rules (e.g., it contains sensitive or disallowed content), LLM Guard stops the stream immediately.\n\n3. Logging and Error Handling:\n   In the code above, the logging mechanism (set to INFO) will display informational messages about scanning progress. If any scanner raises a flag, you see an error in the logs, and you can handle it—such as returning a user-friendly message or storing an incident in your logs.\n\n4. Using the Vault for Secrets:\n   You can store your API key in the Vault (or use environment variables). If you prefer to avoid environment variables, you can call vault.add_secret() and vault.get_secret() as shown above.\n\nWith this approach, you can robustly guard both prompt inputs and model outputs with minimal integration overhead. You simply register the scanners you need, then write your business logic around the run(...) function to either block requests or process completed responses.",

Using AI language models responsibly and safely is very important, especially when it comes to content that could be harmful to children. Here's how you can use LLM Guard to help protect your children:\n\n1. **Prompt Scanning**: LLM Guard can scan the input prompt in parallel with the OpenAI completion. If the prompt is detected as potentially harmful or inappropriate, the completion will be stopped, and the error will be logged. This helps prevent the model from generating content that could be problematic.\n\n```python\nfrom llm_guard.input_scanners import Anonymize, PromptInjection, TokenLimit, Toxicity\n\ninput_scanners = [\n    Anonymize(),\n    PromptInjection(),\n    TokenLimit(max_tokens=500),\n    Toxicity()\n]\n```\n\n2. **Output Streaming and Scanning**: LLM Guard can also scan the output in streaming mode, stopping the completion as soon as the output is detected as invalid or inappropriate. This ensures that potentially harmful content is caught and blocked before it is fully generated.\n\n```python\nfrom llm_guard.output_scanners import Deanonymize, NoRefusal, Relevance, Sensitive\n\noutput_scanners = [\n    Deanonymize(),\n    NoRefusal(),\n    Relevance(),\n    Sensitive()\n]\n```\n\n3. **Vault Integration**: LLM Guard can be integrated with the Vault, a secure storage system for sensitive information. This allows you to store and retrieve sensitive data, such as personal information or content that should not be exposed, without the risk of it being included in the model's output.\n\n```python\nfrom llm_guard.vault import Vault\n\nvault = Vault()\n```\n\nBy using these features of LLM Guard, you can create a more secure and controlled environment for your children to interact with AI language models, reducing the risk of exposure to harmful or inappropriate content.\n\nRemember, it's important to stay vigilant and continuously monitor the use of these tools to ensure the safety and well-being of your children.

          "response": "Absolutely! Let me break down and expand on the example you provided, explain the components, and show how to implement a simple “LLM Guard” workflow with OpenAI.\n\n### 1. What is LLM Guard?\nLLM Guard is an open-source library for securing interactions with Large Language Models (LLMs) by **scanning prompts and outputs** for risks such as prompt injection, sensitive data leaks, toxicity, and more. It can be used as a middleware between your application and LLM APIs like OpenAI's.\n\n### 2. The Example: Fastest, Least Disruptive Integration\n\n#### Workflow Overview\n\n- **Parallel Prompt Scanning:**  \n  When you receive a prompt from a user, you send it to OpenAI **and** scan it with LLM Guard at the same time. If the scan detects a problem (e.g., PII, prompt injection), you stop the LLM response and log/handle the error.\n\n- **Streaming Output Scanning:**  \n  As the LLM streams output, you scan it chunk-by-chunk. If you detect a problem (e.g., refusal to answer, sensitive data in output), you halt the response.\n\n---\n\n### 3. Example Setup\n\n#### Install Required Libraries\n\n```python\n# LLM Guard from GitHub, OpenAI, and asyncio\npip install llm_guard@git+https://github.com/protectai/llm-guard.git\npip install openai asyncio\n```\n\n#### Import Modules\n\n```python\nimport logging\nimport asyncio\nimport openai\n\nfrom llm_guard.input_scanners import Anonymize, PromptInjection, TokenLimit, Toxicity\nfrom llm_guard.output_scanners import Deanonymize, NoRefusal, Relevance, Sensitive\nfrom llm_guard.vault import Vault\n```\n\n---\n\n### 4. Practical Example\n\nBelow is a **simplified, commented implementation** that follows your described approach.\n\n#### a) Set Up the Scanners\n\n```python\n# Initialize scanners (customize as needed)\ninput_scanners = [\n    PromptInjection(),\n    TokenLimit(max_tokens=1000),\n    Toxicity(),\n    Anonymize(),\n]\n\noutput_scanners = [\n    NoRefusal(),\n    Sensitive(),\n    Relevance(),\n    Deanonymize(),\n]\n\nvault = Vault()  # Used if needed by Anonymize/Deanonymize\n```\n\n#### b) Prompt Validation (in parallel with LLM call)\n\n```python\nasync def scan_prompt(prompt):\n    for scanner in input_scanners:\n        prompt, is_valid, info = scanner.scan(prompt, vault)\n        if not is_valid:\n            logging.error(f\"Prompt blocked by {scanner.__class__.__name__}: {info}\")\n            return None\n    return prompt\n```\n\n#### c) Streaming Output Validation\n\n```python\nasync def stream_and_scan_output(openai_response):\n    partial_output = \"\"\n    async for chunk in openai_response:\n        content = chunk['choices'][0]['delta'].get('content', '')\n        partial_output += content\n\n        # Scan the partial output (could also scan after each chunk)\n        for scanner in output_scanners:\n            partial_output, is_valid, info = scanner.scan(partial_output, vault)\n            if not is_valid:\n                logging.error(f\"Output blocked by {scanner.__class__.__name__}: {info}\")\n                return  # Stop streaming to user\n\n        print(content, end='', flush=True)  # Or handle as needed\n```\n\n#### d) Orchestrating the Flow\n\n```python\nasync def handle_request(prompt):\n    scan_task = asyncio.create_task(scan_prompt(prompt))\n    # Start the OpenAI request in parallel\n    openai_task = asyncio.create_task(openai.ChatCompletion.acreate(\n        model=\"gpt-3.5-turbo\",\n        messages=[{\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": prompt}],\n        stream=True\n    ))\n\n    # Wait for prompt scan\n    scanned_prompt = await scan_task\n    if scanned_prompt is None:\n        return \"Prompt blocked.\"\n\n    # If prompt is valid, stream and scan output\n    openai_response = await openai_task\n    await stream_and_scan_output(openai_response)\n```\n\n---\n\n### 5. Key Points\n\n- **Prompt and output scanning can run in parallel with LLM inference for minimal latency.**\n- **Stops LLM processing ASAP when a risk is detected.**\n- **Scanners are modular—add or remove as required for your threat model.**\n- **Vault is optional but useful for anonymization/deanonymization.**\n\n---\n\n### 6. Next Steps\n\n- Adjust scanners & thresholds for your use-case.\n- Integrate with your logging/alerting.\n- Optionally, use the vault for handling PII.\n\n---\n\n**Let me know if you want a complete, runnable code sample or have questions about any part of the workflow!**",

The idea is:\n\n• Prompt scanning in parallel: Validate or transform the user’s prompt as soon as possible—ideally at the same time you start the OpenAI call or just before it. If the prompt fails any checks (e.g., contains disallowed content), you stop immediately.  \n• Output scanning in streaming mode: You start receiving tokens from OpenAI, and each token or block of tokens is run through output scanners.

Vault and API Key Setup  \n   • Vault.configure() is where you set your OpenAI secrets. Another option is to set environment variables or use a secrets manager.  \n\n2. Prompt Scanning (input_scanners)  \n   • Anonymize: Redacts PII or other sensitive info from the user’s prompt if discovered.  \n   • PromptInjection: Watches for attempts to override or bypass system instructions.  \n   • TokenLimit: Ensures the combined size of the user prompt + potential model reply doesn’t exceed a safe limit.  \n   • Toxicity: Flags hateful or otherwise toxic language.  \n\n3. Output Scanning (output_scanners)  \n   • Deanonymize: If your pipeline temporarily removed sensitive info and uses placeholders for scanning, you can restore them here if desired.  \n   • NoRefusal: Detects if the model is refusing to answer or providing incomplete content.  \n   • Relevance: Flags when the model veers off-topic.  \n   • Sensitive: Performs final checks to see if the content violates policies.  \n\n4. Stopping Logic and Streaming  \n   • stop_on_input_fail=True ensures that if the prompt triggers a blocking rule, we won’t call OpenAI.  \n   • stop_on_output_fail=True ensures that if the model starts generating disallowed text, the output streaming stops immediately.  \n\n5. Parallelization Considerations  \n   • In this pseudocode, we do a quick synchronous prompt check, then call the LLM. For true parallel scanning, you could asynchronously call the LLM while scanning the prompt in background tasks. However, you rarely want to forward a prompt to the LLM if it’s potentially invalid—so scanning prior to or at least concurrently with the LLM request typically makes more sense.  \n\n6. Handling Streamed Tokens  \n   • LLMGuard provides mechanisms to read OpenAI’s streaming responses token-by-token (or chunk-by-chunk). Each chunk can be fed into the output scanners. If a violation is detected at any point, the streaming is interrupted.  \n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nFurther Customization\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n• You can implement your own scanning logic by creating custom scanner classes that inherit from LLMGuard’s base scanners.  \n• You can replace openai’s streaming with any LLM provider that supports a streaming API and integrate it similarly.  \n• For advanced usage (logging, caching, or partial transformations), hook into the scanning events in LLMGuard to record exactly which scanner triggered.  \n\nThis example illustrates the most straightforward approach to “fast and least disruptive” scanning: do an immediate gate check on the prompt before or exactly as you send it to the LLM, and then monitor the streaming tokens for any policy violations. When used properly, it allows you to catch true issues at the earliest possible moment with minimal overhead.",

          "response": "Glad to hear you’re sharing the work! The example you provided demonstrates how to integrate LLM Guard with an OpenAI-based application in a way that minimizes both latency and disruption to the user experience. Let’s break down what’s happening in the code and the overall approach:\n\n1. Overall Concept\n\n • The idea is to protect both the input prompt and the generated output in real time.  \n • For the prompt (input), the system scans it as the OpenAI completion is being generated. If the prompt doesn’t meet the defined safety or policy criteria (for example, if it appears to be an attempt at prompt injection), the process is halted immediately and an error is logged.  \n • For the output, scanning happens as the text is being streamed back from OpenAI. Should any segment of the output be flagged (e.g., toxic content, sensitive information), the generation is stopped on the fly.\n\n2. Components in the Code\n\n a. Input Scanners  \n  – The sample imports scanners like Anonymize, PromptInjection, TokenLimit, and Toxicity. These are designed to:\n   ○ Anonymize: Remove or mask sensitive or personally identifiable information from the prompt.\n   ○ PromptInjection: Detect if a prompt might be attempting to manipulate or break out of expected instructions.\n   ○ TokenLimit: Ensure the prompt doesn’t exceed specified token limits.\n   ○ Toxicity: Check for language that may be deemed harmful or inflammatory.\n\n b. Output Scanners  \n  – Similarly, the output scanners (Deanonymize, NoRefusal, Relevance, Sensitive) serve purposes like:\n   ○ Deanonymize: Possibly re-associate or validate information that was anonymized before, if necessary.\n   ○ NoRefusal: Ensure that the generated output isn’t a safe completion refusal when not intended.\n   ○ Relevance: Check that the output remains on-topic and relevant.\n   ○ Sensitive: Flag content that might be overly sensitive or harmful.\n\n c. The Vault  \n  – The Vault module (imported from llm_guard.vault) likely handles the secure management of policies, scanning rules, and possibly secret credentials or configurations that the scanners use.\n\n3. Integration Workflow\n\n • When you call the OpenAI API to generate text, two processes happen in parallel:\n  1. Prompt scanning: As soon as you submit a prompt, it’s scanned by the suite of input scanners. If any rule is violated, the generation process stops, and the error is logged—this prevents any disallowed prompt from producing output.\n  2. Streaming output scanning: As the OpenAI API streams its response back (which is important for minimizing latency in interactive applications), the output is continuously checked. If any part of the output fails the validation (for instance, if toxicity levels go above acceptable limits), the generation is interrupted immediately.\n\n4. Advantages of This Method\n\n • Minimal Disruption: Since scanning is both parallel (for the prompt) and streaming (for the output), the user sees minimal interruption unless there's a clear violation, ensuring a fast response time and improved usability.\n • Safety First: By interrupting the process as soon as any harmful content is detected, you provide a safer interface to the end-user.\n • Logging and Monitoring: Immediate logging of errors helps in monitoring potential abuse or misconfigurations in real time.\n\n5. Installation and Dependencies\n\n • The pip install commands at the start show that LLM Guard is available from its GitHub repository.  \n • Note that you also install asyncio and OpenAI, which are necessary to manage asynchronous API calls and responses.\n\n6. Next Steps for Implementation\n\n • You’d typically wrap your OpenAI API call in an asynchronous routine that triggers the input scanning immediately and then begins output scanning as the response is streamed.\n • Depending on your application, you might want to customize the scanning policies or thresholds. The Vault can be used to securely manage these configurations.\n • Finally, consider extending the logging mechanism to integrate with your application’s monitoring or alerting systems.\n\nIn summary, the example shows a practical approach to protecting AI model interactions without adding excessive latency. It’s a neat balance between safety and performance—the dual scanning (input and streaming output) makes sure that both the prompt and the generated content adhere to your defined guidelines.\n\nLet me know if you need more specifics on any part of the implementation or have additional questions!",

If the prompt is invalid, it's better to stop the completion and log the error, rather than wasting resources on an invalid input.\n   - By scanning the prompt in parallel, you can minimize the impact on the overall completion time, as the scanning process can happen concurrently with the actual completion.\n\n2. **Scanning the output in streaming mode**:\n   - Scanning the output in streaming mode allows you to stop the completion as soon as the output is detected as invalid. This is crucial for preventing the generation of harmful or inappropriate content.\n   - By stopping the completion as soon as the output is invalid, you can minimize the amount of invalid content generated, reducing the risk of exposing users to such content.\n\nThe specific scanners used in the example are also well-chosen:\n\n- **Anonymize** and **Deanonymize**: These scanners help protect the privacy of individuals by anonymizing and deanonymizing sensitive information in the prompt and output, respectively.\n- **PromptInjection**: This scanner checks for potential injection attacks in the prompt, which is important for security and safety.\n- **TokenLimit**: This scanner ensures the output does not exceed a specified token limit, which can be useful for controlling the length and complexity of the generated content.\n- **Toxicity** and **Sensitive**: These scanners help identify and block potentially toxic or sensitive content, further enhancing the safety and appropriateness of the generated output.\n\nOverall, the approach demonstrated in the example is a great way to leverage LLM Guard to ensure the fastest and least disruptive use of large language models, while maintaining high standards of safety, security, and relevance.",

Here's a breakdown of the key concepts:\n\n## Key Features\n\n### 1. **Parallel Processing**\n- The prompt scanning happens simultaneously with the OpenAI API call\n- This minimizes latency since both operations run concurrently\n- If the prompt fails validation, the completion can be cancelled before incurring costs\n\n### 2. **Streaming Output Validation**\n- Output is scanned as it streams from the API\n- Invalid content triggers immediate termination\n- This prevents harmful content from being fully generated or displayed\n\n## Implementation Components\n\n### Input Scanners:\n- **Anonymize**: Detects and masks PII (Personal Identifiable Information)\n- **PromptInjection**: Identifies potential prompt injection attacks\n- **TokenLimit**: Ensures prompts don't exceed token limits\n- **Toxicity**: Filters harmful or toxic content\n\n### Output Scanners:\n- **Deanonymize**: Restores masked PII using the Vault\n- **NoRefusal**: Detects when the model refuses to answer\n- **Relevance**: Ensures output stays on-topic\n- **Sensitive**: Identifies sensitive information in responses\n\n### Vault:\n- Securely stores anonymized data mappings\n- Enables reversible anonymization\n\n## Example Implementation Pattern:\n\n```python\nimport asyncio\nfrom openai import AsyncOpenAI\n\nasync def safe_completion(prompt, client, input_scanners, output_scanners, vault):\n    # Start prompt scanning and API call in parallel\n    scan_task = asyncio.create_task(scan_prompt(prompt, input_scanners))\n    completion_task = asyncio.create_task(client.chat.completions.create(\n        model=\"gpt-3.5-turbo\",\n        messages=[{\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": prompt}],\n        stream=True\n    ))\n    \n    # Check prompt validity\n    is_valid, sanitized_prompt = await scan_task\n    if not is_valid:\n        completion_task.cancel()\n        logging.error(\"Invalid prompt detected\")\n        return None\n    \n    # Stream and validate output\n    response = await completion_task\n    validated_output = \"\"\n    \n    async for chunk in response:\n        if chunk.choices[0].delta.content:\n            partial_output = chunk.choices[0].delta.content\n            is_valid, sanitized = await scan_output(partial_output, output_scanners)\n            \n            if not is_valid:\n                logging.error(\"Invalid output detected\")\n                break\n                \n            validated_output += sanitized\n    \n    return validated_output\n```\n\nThis approach provides security without significantly impacting user experience, making it ideal for production applications where both safety and performance are critical.",

          "response": "Certainly! Here’s a detailed explanation of how the example you provided uses **LLM Guard** to enhance the safety of LLM (Large Language Model) interactions, focusing on the code and the scanning approach. I’ll break down the concepts, the code structure, and the typical workflow.\n\n---\n\n## **Background: What is LLM Guard?**\n\n[LLM Guard](https://github.com/protectai/llm-guard) is an open-source library designed to protect applications using LLMs (like OpenAI’s GPT) by scanning both inputs (prompts) and outputs (completions) for various security and safety issues, such as prompt injections, toxic content, PII leaks, etc.\n\n---\n\n## **Overview of the Example**\n\nThe example demonstrates a **non-blocking, parallel approach** to LLM safety:\n\n1. **Prompt scanning** runs in parallel with the LLM completion call.\n2. **Output scanning** happens in streaming mode—scanning output tokens as they arrive, allowing you to halt the output immediately if a problem is detected.\n\n---\n\n## **Key Components Used**\n\n### 1. **Input Scanners**\n\n- **Anonymize**: Detects and/or removes personal information (PII) from prompts.\n- **PromptInjection**: Detects attempts to inject malicious instructions or override the system prompt.\n- **TokenLimit**: Ensures the prompt does not exceed a maximum token count.\n- **Toxicity**: Detects toxic, harmful, or obscene language in prompts.\n\n### 2. **Output Scanners**\n\n- **Deanonymize**: Detects if the model “deanonymizes” redacted information.\n- **NoRefusal**: Flags output where the model refuses to answer (useful for some use-cases).\n- **Relevance**: Checks if the output is relevant to the prompt.\n- **Sensitive**: Flags the presence of sensitive information (like PII, secrets, etc.).\n\n### 3. **Vault**\n\n- **Vault**: A secure, in-memory or persistent storage used by LLM Guard to store PII mappings, secrets, or other sensitive data for anonymization and deanonymization.\n\n---\n\n## **Typical Code Structure**\n\n### **Imports**\n\n```python\nimport logging\n\nfrom llm_guard.input_scanners import Anonymize, PromptInjection, TokenLimit, Toxicity\nfrom llm_guard.output_scanners import Deanonymize, NoRefusal, Relevance, Sensitive\nfrom llm_guard.vault import Vault\n```\n\n### **Parallel Scanning Approach**\n\n1. **Prompt scanning** is done in parallel with the LLM API call. If the scan finds an issue, it can cancel the LLM request.\n2. **Streaming output scanning** evaluates the LLM’s output as it streams, stopping if an issue is detected.\n\n### **Pseudo-Workflow**\n\n```python\nimport asyncio\n\nasync def scan_prompt_and_call_llm(prompt, llm_call_func, vault):\n    # Start prompt scanning in the background\n    scan_task = asyncio.create_task(scan_prompt(prompt, vault))\n    # Start LLM call in the background\n    llm_task = asyncio.create_task(llm_call_func(prompt))\n\n    # Wait for the first to finish (ideally scanning is faster)\n    done, pending = await asyncio.wait({scan_task, llm_task}, return_when=asyncio.FIRST_COMPLETED)\n\n    if scan_task in done:\n        scan_result = scan_task.result()\n        if not scan_result[\"is_valid\"]:\n            for task in pending:\n                task.cancel()  # Stop LLM if prompt is invalid\n            logging.error(\"Prompt is invalid: %s\", scan_result[\"error\"])\n            return None\n\n    # If LLM finishes first or scan is valid, continue\n    output = await llm_task\n    # Stream output through scanners (pseudocode)\n    for chunk in stream_llm_output(output):\n        if not scan_output_chunk(chunk, vault):\n            logging.error(\"Output chunk invalid, stopping...\")\n            break\n        yield chunk\n```\n\n### **Scanner Usage**\n\nEach scanner (e.g., `PromptInjection()`) is usually used like:\n\n```python\nanonymize = Anonymize()\nresult = anonymize.scan(prompt, vault)\nif not result[\"is_valid\"]:\n    # Handle error\n```\n\n---\n\n## **Why This Pattern?**\n\n- **Speed**: Running the prompt scan in parallel with the LLM call minimizes latency.\n- **Safety**: Streaming output scanning allows you to abort as soon as a problem is detected.\n- **Non-disruptive**: The user experience is minimally affected unless a real issue is found.\n\n---\n\n## **Summary Table**\n\n| Scanner Type     | Example Used           | Purpose                                                              |\n|------------------|-----------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Input            | Anonymize             | Redact PII from prompts                                              |\n| Input            | PromptInjection       | Detect prompt injection attempts                                     |\n| Input            | TokenLimit            | Enforce maximum prompt length                                        |\n| Input            | Toxicity              | Block toxic/abusive language                                         |\n| Output           | Deanonymize           | Detect deanonymization of redacted data                              |\n| Output           | NoRefusal             | Detect \"refusal\" responses                                           |\n| Output           | Relevance             | Detect irrelevant/completely off-topic output                        |\n| Output           | Sensitive             | Detect sensitive data in output                                      |\n| Vault            | Vault                 | Securely store mappings for anonymization/deanonymization            |\n\n---\n\n## **References**\n\n- [LLM Guard GitHub](https://github.com/protectai/llm-guard)\n- [LLM Guard Documentation](https://llm-guard.readthedocs.io/)\n\n---\n\n**If you want a full, working code example using OpenAI and LLM Guard, just ask!**",

          "response": "Below is a high-level overview of what LLM Guard is, how it helps with prompt and output scanning, and how you can quickly integrate it into your code. The general idea is to use “scanners” that validate or transform (redact/anonymize or check policy compliance, etc.) both the user input (prompt) and the model’s output, stopping or modifying as soon as any disallowed condition is detected.\n\n──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n1. What LLM Guard Does\n──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n\nLLM Guard provides:\n• Input Scanners: Check or transform incoming prompts (e.g., remove personal information, detect toxicity, limit token length, prevent prompt injection).\n• Output Scanners: Validate or transform responses before sending them back (e.g., remove or mask sensitive data, measure relevance, detect refusal text).\n• Vault for Secrets: A secure way to store and manage credentials or any other sensitive data required for scanning or for the LLM calls.\n\nBy attaching these scanners to your request/response pipeline, you can:\n1. Prevent certain unsafe or undesired user requests from ever reaching the LLM.  \n2. Stop or sanitize LLM outputs in real time if they become invalid.\n\nThe workflow is typically:  \n• Validate or transform prompt → Send prompt to LLM → Stream output while checking each token → Immediately stop or sanitize output if it violates any rule.\n\n──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n2. Setting Up Your Environment\n──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nYou can install LLM Guard directly from the GitHub repository and also ensure openai and asyncio are installed:\n──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n# pip install llm_guard@git+https://github.com/protectai/llm-guard.git\n# pip install openai asyncio\n──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n\n──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n3. Basic Usage in Code\n──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nBelow is a minimal example that demonstrates how to configure and use some common scanners in both the prompt and output stages.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nimport asyncio\nimport logging\nimport openai\n\n# Import scanners from LLM Guard\nfrom llm_guard.input_scanners import Anonymize, PromptInjection, TokenLimit, Toxicity\nfrom llm_guard.output_scanners import Deanonymize, NoRefusal, Relevance, Sensitive\nfrom llm_guard.vault import Vault\n\n# Configure logging as needed\nlogging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO)\n\n# Optional: Set up a vault if you need to store secrets\nVault.set(\"OPENAI_API_KEY\", \"your_key_here\")  # Or fetch from secure storage\n\nasync def main():\n    # 1.

Configure output scanners for your LLM response\n    output_scanners = [\n        NoRefusal(),                  # Ensures the model does not simply refuse requests (based on your policy)\n        Sensitive(),                  # Flags or removes sensitive data if it appears\n        Deanonymize(),               # Removes or masks identifying information\n        Relevance(threshold=0.2)     # Detects content that might be irrelevant or off-topic\n    ]\n    \n    # Example prompt\n    user_prompt = \"Hi, my name is John Doe and my SSN is 123-45-6789. Can you summarize a story about wheels of time?\"\n\n    try:\n        # 3. Validate (and possibly transform) the prompt with the input scanners\n        for scanner in input_scanners:\n            user_prompt = scanner.scan(user_prompt)\n\n        # 4. Send prompt to OpenAI while simultaneously scanning the output\n        #    The exact streaming logic depends on your library usage; for example:\n        response_chunks = []\n        async for chunk in openai.ChatCompletion.acreate(\n            model=\"gpt-3.5-turbo\",\n            messages=[{\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": user_prompt}],\n            stream=True\n        ):\n            if \"choices\" in chunk:\n                for choice in chunk[\"choices\"]:\n                    token_text = choice[\"delta\"].get(\"content\", \"\")\n                    \n                    # Check each chunk/token with your output scanners\n                    for scanner in output_scanners:\n                        token_text = scanner.scan(token_text)\n                        \n                    response_chunks.append(token_text)\n\n        # Once all chunks are processed, join them into the final answer\n        final_response = \"\".join(response_chunks)\n        print(\"Model Response:\", final_response)\n\n    except Exception as e:\n        logging.error(f\"An error occurred during scanning or completion: {e}\")\n\n# Run the async main function\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    asyncio.run(main())\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nExplanation of Key Steps:\n• We configure a list of input scanners and loop through them, letting each scanner handle or modify the prompt (for instance, Anonymize might redact SSNs or personal names).  \n• Next, we call the ChatCompletion API in streaming mode. In an async loop, we capture each chunk of text the model returns.  \n• For each chunk of text, we apply the output scanners. If any scanner flags the chunk or modifies it, that happens immediately. You can decide to stop streaming altogether (by raising an exception) if a violation is hit.  \n• Finally, we collect all processed chunks into one final response.\n\n──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n4. Adding or Customizing Scanners\n──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nLLM Guard comes with several built-in scanners. You can also create custom scanners by subclassing the provided scanner class. For instance, if you want to detect a certain keyword or pattern in user prompts, you could create a custom input scanner. The general pattern:\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nfrom llm_guard.scanner import BaseScanner\n\nclass CustomKeywordScanner(BaseScanner):\n    def __init__(self, banned_keywords):\n        self.banned_keywords = banned_keywords\n\n    def scan(self, text):\n        if any(keyword.lower() in text.lower() for keyword in self.banned_keywords):\n            raise ValueError(\"Banned keyword detected in prompt\")\n        return text\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThen just add CustomKeywordScanner(...) to your input_scanners list.\n\n──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n5. Where to Go from Here\n──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n• Explore other scanners and fine-tune threshold parameters (like toxicity thresholds).  \n• Use the Vault to manage your tokens or other secrets, if necessary.  \n• Combine LLM Guard with additional business-logic checks to control access, handle actions after scanning, or maintain logs for regulated environments.\n\n──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nSummary\n──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nThis setup shows one of the quickest ways to introduce input and output validation for your LLM.

          "response": "LLM Guard is a tool designed to help developers add an extra layer of safety when interacting with language models. In essence, it “guards” both the inputs (the prompts) and the outputs (the completions) of LLM calls. Here are some detailed points about how it works and what its individual components do:\n\n1. Input Scanners:\n a. Anonymize – This scanner detects and masks any sensitive or personally identifiable information (PII) present in the prompt. This helps prevent inadvertent disclosure of personal data when the text is processed or logged.\n b. PromptInjection – It’s aimed at identifying potential prompt injection attacks. That is, if a prompt includes patterns or content that might manipulate the model into behaving in unintended ways, this scanner can flag or neutralize such behavior.\n c. TokenLimit – Before sending a prompt to the language model, you might want to make sure it doesn’t exceed a certain token count. This scanner checks that limit and can block overly long inputs, ensuring you stay within model or API constraints.\n d. Toxicity – This scanner analyzes the prompt for toxic or harmful language. By catching such content early, you reduce the risk of generating or spreading harmful messages.\n\n2. Output Scanners:\n a. Deanonymize – After the prompt’s PII has been masked, the output might refer back to that content in some way. Deanonymization can reintroduce safe versions (or limited forms) of that data where necessary, usually in a controlled or redacted manner.\n b. NoRefusal – Sometimes language models return generic refusals (e.g., “I’m sorry, but I can’t help with that…”). The NoRefusal scanner can be used to ensure that your system does not rely on canned or unhelpful responses when a refusal is detected.\n c. Relevance – This tool helps verify that the generated output stays on track with the input prompt. It ensures that the answer is relevant and not diverging unexpectedly.\n d. Sensitive – Beyond just checking for toxicity, the Sensitive scanner looks for additional categories of sensitive content, ensuring that outputs do not leak confidential, inappropriate, or otherwise problematic information.\n\n3. The Scanning Approach:\n • Parallel Input Scanning: When an LLM request begins, LLM Guard scans the prompt concurrently with the OpenAI completion request. If the prompt is detected to be problematic (for example, if it violates token limits or contains potential injection code), the process is halted early and an error is logged.\n • Streaming Output Scanning: As the language model generates text (especially in a streaming mode), the output is analyzed token-by-token (or in small batches) in real time. This way, if the content begins to include flagged or sensitive material, the completion can be stopped as soon as an issue is detected. This minimizes exposure to harmful or unintended outputs.\n\n4. The Vault:\n • The Vault module in LLM Guard typically serves as a centralized manager for configuration details, secure keys, and even policies that govern the behavior of the scanners. For instance, it might store mappings for what constitutes sensitive data, threshold values for toxicity, or token limits that can be adjusted per use case. In some cases, it can integrate with external secret management or policy systems, ensuring that security configurations are maintained centrally and can be audited.\n\n5. Integration and Usage:\n • The tool is designed to be as non-disruptive as possible. It allows for smooth integration where existing LLM calls are only slightly augmented with pre- and post-processing steps.\n • By installing via pip (e.g., using the GitHub URL), you’re ready to import and configure various scanners. Each scanner typically comes with its own set of parameters that allow you to pragmatically decide what thresholds should be in place.\n • The overall architecture is asynchronous in many parts (leveraging asyncio, for example), which means the scanning does not impose a heavy delay on the responsiveness of your app or system.\n\n6. Why It’s Useful:\n • Security and Compliance: By running multiple checks on both inputs and outputs, you guard against a host of issues—from inadvertently leaking sensitive data to suffering from prompt injection attacks.\n • Dynamic and Real-Time Protection: The streaming output scanner, in particular, means you can stop problematic completions in real time, rather than letting unsafe content be fully generated before you can intervene.\n • Flexibility: With both input and output scanning, the system can be tailored to different risk profiles and regulatory requirements.\n\nIn summary, LLM Guard is an evolving utility that bridges the gap between what language models produce and the security or compliance needs of production systems. Its modular approach—through separate scanners for anonymization, injection detection, token limits, toxicity checks, and more—ensures that various facets of safe LLM usage are covered. The Vault acts as the backbone for managing these configurations securely and efficiently.",

Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Scanning the prompt in parallel with the OpenAI completion**:\n   - The library uses a parallel approach to scan the user's prompt while the OpenAI completion is being generated.\n   - If the prompt is deemed invalid (e.g., it contains toxic content, exceeds a token limit, or injects malicious code), the completion is immediately stopped, and the error is logged.\n\n2. **Scanning the output in streaming mode**:\n   - LLM Guard also scans the output from the OpenAI completion in a streaming mode.\n   - As soon as the output is detected as invalid (e.g., it contains sensitive information, is irrelevant to the task, or refuses to perform certain actions), the completion is stopped.\n\nThe example demonstrates the use of several input and output scanners provided by the LLM Guard library:\n\n- **Input Scanners**:\n  - `Anonymize`: Anonymizes sensitive information in the input prompt.\n  - `PromptInjection`: Detects and blocks potential prompt injection attacks.\n  - `TokenLimit`: Enforces a maximum token limit for the input prompt.\n  - `Toxicity`: Detects and blocks toxic or harmful content in the input prompt.\n\n- **Output Scanners**:\n  - `Deanonymize`: Deanonymizes sensitive information in the output.\n  - `NoRefusal`: Ensures the model does not refuse to perform certain actions.\n  - `Relevance`: Checks the relevance of the output to the task.\n  - `Sensitive`: Detects and blocks sensitive information in the output.\n\nThe example also demonstrates the use of the `Vault` module, which is a centralized configuration management system for LLM Guard. It allows developers to manage and apply security policies across multiple LLM models and applications.\n\nIn summary, the provided example showcases how to leverage the LLM Guard library to enhance the safety and security of your LLM-powered applications by scanning both the input prompts and the generated outputs in an efficient and non-disruptive manner.",

Install dependencies:  \n   pip install llm_guard@git+https://github.com/protectai/llm-guard.git  \n   pip install openai asyncio  \n\n2. Make sure to import the necessary modules:  \n   import logging\n   from llm_guard.input_scanners import Anonymize, PromptInjection, TokenLimit, Toxicity\n   from llm_guard.output_scanners import Deanonymize, NoRefusal, Relevance, Sensitive\n   from llm_guard.vault import Vault  \n\n3. Parallel prompt scanning:  \n   • Before sending the user prompt to the LLM, run it through the input scanners (e.g., checking for toxic content, prompt injection, or excessive tokens).  \n   • If any input fails the configured checks, stop the request and log the issue.  \n\n4. Streaming output scanning:  \n   • Stream the LLM response in chunks.  \n   • Each chunk is scanned (for instance, checking for relevance, sensitive information, or refusal language).  \n   • As soon as you detect output that violates your scanning rules, stop streaming and handle the violation (e.g., log it and show a safe fallback message).  \n\n5. Rationale for this workflow:  \n   • By scanning the prompt in parallel with the LLM’s generation request, you avoid letting obviously problematic prompts generate any completion.  \n   • By scanning the response stream in real time, you can stop early if the LLM starts producing disallowed content.  \n\n6. Practical usage tips:  \n   • In production, you’ll typically integrate these scans into a middleware-like setup that intercepts both incoming prompts and outgoing responses.  \n   • Logging is crucial for auditing reasons—both to identify what triggered a refusal and to analyze patterns requiring attention.  \n   • If your application demands anonymity or data masking, combine the Anonymize and Deanonymize scanners appropriately.  \n   • The Vault can be used to securely store and reference tokens or secrets needed by the scanning logic.  \n\nFollowing these steps allows you to catch most policy-violating prompts or outputs before they reach the user, minimizing disruption for valid interactions and ensuring policy compliance.",

          "response": "Certainly! As a recognized security architect, you’re likely looking for a critical, ethical, and practical analysis of how to use LLM Guard for safeguarding LLM (Large Language Model) interactions with minimal disruption. Let’s break down the example you provided, highlight its strengths and caveats, and discuss ethical considerations.\n\n### 1. Fast and Least Disruptive Integration\n\nThe example demonstrates two key design decisions for rapid, low-friction deployment:\n- **Parallel Prompt Scanning:**  \n  The prompt is scanned in parallel with sending it to the OpenAI API. If the scanner flags it as invalid (e.g., toxic, prompt injection detected, too long), the in-flight LLM request can be canceled.\n- **Streaming Output Scanning:**  \n  The output is streamed from the LLM and scanned in real time. If any content violation is detected (e.g., sensitive data, refusal to answer, lack of relevance), the stream is aborted immediately.\n\n**Ethical and Security Implications:**\n\n- **Privacy by Design:**  \n  The use of input scanners like `Anonymize` supports privacy, ensuring sensitive user data isn’t inadvertently sent to the LLM provider.\n- **Minimized Latency:**  \n  Parallel and streaming designs reduce user-perceived latency, supporting usability and adoption.\n- **Fail-Fast:**  \n  Early detection and interruption of non-compliant content prevent exposure or propagation of malicious or sensitive information.\n- **Auditability:**  \n  Logging invalid prompts/outputs is essential for compliance, monitoring, and continuous improvement.\n\n### 2. Example Code and Scanner Selection\n\n```python\nimport logging\n\nfrom llm_guard.input_scanners import Anonymize, PromptInjection, TokenLimit, Toxicity\nfrom llm_guard.output_scanners import Deanonymize, NoRefusal, Relevance, Sensitive\nfrom llm_guard.vault import Vault\n```\n\n**Scanners and Their Roles:**\n- **Anonymize/Deanonymize:**  \n  Mask sensitive data before sending it to the LLM, and re-insert it in the output (if appropriate).\n- **PromptInjection:**  \n  Prevent prompt injection attacks, which could result in model misuse or data leakage.\n- **TokenLimit:**  \n  Enforce length limits to prevent abuse and control costs.\n- **Toxicity:**  \n  Block harmful or offensive inputs.\n- **NoRefusal:**  \n  Catch outputs where the model refuses to answer (useful for ensuring task completion).\n- **Relevance:**  \n  Ensure outputs are on-topic and contextually appropriate.\n- **Sensitive:**  \n  Detect disclosure of sensitive or regulated information.\n\n### 3. Ethical Considerations\n\n#### **Transparency & User Notice**\n- Users should be informed that their inputs and outputs are being scanned and possibly transformed, with clear privacy and data handling policies.\n\n#### **Vault Usage**\n- **`llm_guard.vault.Vault`** is typically used for secure storage of secrets, patterns, or cryptographic keys (e.g., for anonymization/deanonymization). Ensure proper lifecycle and access controls around the vault.\n\n#### **Bias and Overblocking**\n- Rigid scanning may result in false positives (e.g., innocuous prompts flagged as \"toxic\" or irrelevant). Monitor scanner performance and allow appeal/override mechanisms where appropriate.\n\n#### **Data Retention**\n- Logs must be managed in accordance with privacy laws (GDPR, CCPA, etc.). Sensitive data shouldn’t be retained longer than necessary.\n\n### 4. Sample Flow (Pseudocode)\n\n```python\n# Pseudocode for ethically and securely integrating LLM Guard\nasync def secure_llm_interaction(prompt):\n    # 1. Anonymize input (if required)\n    anonymized_prompt = Anonymize().scan(prompt)\n\n    # 2. Scan for prompt injection, toxicity, etc.\n    if not PromptInjection().scan(anonymized_prompt):\n        logging.error(\"Prompt injection detected\")\n        return \"Input rejected due to security policy.\"\n\n    if not Toxicity().scan(anonymized_prompt):\n        logging.error(\"Toxic input detected\")\n        return \"Input rejected due to harmful content.\"\n\n    # 3. Send anonymized prompt to LLM (in parallel with scanning)\n    llm_response_stream = openai.Completion.create_stream(anonymized_prompt)\n    \n    # 4. Stream output and scan in real-time\n    output = \"\"\n    for chunk in llm_response_stream:\n        output += chunk\n        if not Sensitive().scan(chunk):\n            logging.error(\"Sensitive info detected, halting output.\")\n            break\n        if not Relevance().scan(chunk):\n            logging.warning(\"Irrelevant output detected, consider halting.\")\n            break\n        \n    # 5. Deanonymize output if necessary\n    final_output = Deanonymize().scan(output)\n    return final_output\n```\n\n### 5. Conclusion\n\nThis “least disruptive” approach leverages LLM Guard to:\n- Enhance privacy, security, and compliance without major architectural changes.\n- Enable real-time, actionable risk mitigation.\n- Uphold ethical standards by protecting users and organizational assets.\n\n**For robust adoption:**\n- Document your scanner configuration and rationale.\n- Provide user-friendly error messages.\n- Continuously review scanner efficacy and update patterns/rules as threats evolve.\n\n---\n\n**References:**  \n- [LLM Guard documentation](https://github.com/protectai/llm-guard)\n- [OpenAI API reference](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/introduction)\n- [OWASP LLM Top 10](https://owasp.org/www-project-top-10-for-large-language-model-applications/)\n\nIf you need a deeper dive into scanner configuration, privacy impact assessment, or custom vault integrations, let me know!",

Make sure you have the required libraries installed and that you properly configure your environment before running the sample code.\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n1) Installing the Required Packages\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nYou can install LLM Guard directly from the GitHub repository, alongside openai and asyncio:\n\n   # pip install llm_guard@git+https://github.com/protectai/llm-guard.git\n   # pip install openai asyncio\n\nMake sure you install any additional libraries required by your input/output scanners or vault integrations if your project grows more complex.\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n2) Overview of LLM Guard’s Core Purpose\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nLLM Guard allows you to intercept and validate/promote safe usage of Large Language Model (LLM) completions. You can:\n\n• Scan incoming prompts (requests) before they reach the LLM. If a prompt violates certain conditions—like containing personal data to be anonymized, or tripping a toxicity check—you can reject or sanitize it.  \n• Scan outgoing responses from the LLM. In a streaming scenario, you can terminate or sanitize the content as soon as it violates your policies.  \n• Integrate with a “vault” if you need specialized handling or more complex transformations of the data.\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n3) Example Project Structure\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nHere’s a minimal structure for a Python script using LLM Guard.

If the scanner deems the prompt invalid (e.g., it’s too large, toxic, or attempts to inject malicious instructions), you can either sanitize it or block it outright.  \n• output_scanners: Likewise, apply these to each token (or chunk of output). This allows you to catch and filter potential disallowed content “mid-stream,” stopping the response if you see something undesirable.  \n• vault: If you need to securely handle credentials (like your OpenAI API key) or other secrets, Vault can be used to retrieve them in a secure manner.  \n• Logging: Consider adjusting your logging level or format depending on your security requirements. Sometimes you might not want to log raw prompt data if it can contain sensitive user information.\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n4) Prompt and Output Validation Strategies\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n• Prompt Anonymization (Anonymize): Use this to remove PII (e.g., names, email addresses, phone numbers) from the prompt text.  \n• Prompt Injection (PromptInjection): Checks if the user is trying to override system or developer instructions, or push the model into disallowed states.  \n• Toxicity: Detects potentially hateful, harassing, or other toxic content.  \n• Deanonymize (in output_scanners): Reversible approach—if you needed to anonymize user data, you could also place a placeholder that can later be reinserted at the end if authorized.  \n• Sensitive (in output_scanners): Scans for output that might contain sensitive or regulated data, such as protected health information (PHI) or credit card numbers.\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n5) Additional Considerations\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n• Error Handling: In production, you might wish to catch and handle scanner failures or LLM API errors more gracefully.  \n• Performance: Since you are scanning in parallel or streaming mode, carefully track performance (latency and throughput).  \n• Custom Scanners: LLM Guard can be extended with your own scanners. You can implement specialized logic for your domain (e.g., scanning for advanced domain-specific regulatory compliance).  \n• Monitoring & Auditing: Integrating a monitoring solution can help track how often prompts are blocked or sanitized, and give insight into patterns of abuse or misuse.\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n\nThat’s the general process for using LLM Guard “in the fastest and least disruptive way possible”—you scan the prompt in parallel with your OpenAI call and stream-scan the output, stopping as soon as you detect disallowed content. This ensures you don’t waste tokens after discovering issues, and sensitive or undesirable content doesn’t continue to stream to users.\n\nIf you have further questions about customizing scanners, implementing additional checks, or integrating with more advanced logging and monitoring systems, just let me know!",

          "response": "It looks like you’re exploring a usage pattern for LLM Guard that aims to add security checks around both the prompt and the generated output from an LLM. Let’s break down what the sample is demonstrating and discuss some of the underlying ideas.\n\n1. Purpose and Approach\n\n • The idea is to run security scanners in parallel with the LLM’s normal operation, thereby minimizing interruption while ensuring safety.  \n • For input (the prompt), scanners work concurrently with the completion request. If a scan (e.g., for prompt injection or a violation of token limits) fails, the LLM call is aborted immediately, and the incident is logged.  \n • For output, the system streams the response and checks it as it’s generated. If the response becomes invalid (for example, if it discloses sensitive information or doesn’t comply with relevance guidelines), the process is halted right away.\n\n2. The Code Components\n\n • The input scanners imported here include:  \n  – Anonymize: Likely removes or obscures sensitive identifiers so that private data isn’t leaked through the prompt.  \n  – PromptInjection: Inspects the prompt for malicious patterns or attempts to \"inject\" unwanted instructions into the LLM’s context.  \n  – TokenLimit: Ensures that the prompt does not exceed a safe or predefined token count that might otherwise allow for abuse or unexpected behavior.  \n  – Toxicity: Screens for harmful or abusive language, ensuring that the content provided doesn’t encourage needless harm.\n  \n • The output scanners include:  \n  – Deanonymize: Possibly checks that any anonymized data isn’t inadvertently restored or leaked in the output.  \n  – NoRefusal: Verifies that the response isn’t inappropriately refusing legitimate queries (or perhaps it ensures that the LLM does not rely on default “I’m sorry” refusal patterns for valid queries).  \n  – Relevance: Makes sure that the generated text stays on topic and adheres to the context supplied.  \n  – Sensitive: Monitors for the inadvertent inclusion of sensitive or confidential information in the result.\n  \n • The Vault import (with “Vault ethically”) appears to be related to secure key management or retrieval of credentials while following ethical guidelines. Although the last part (“ethically”) might need clarification (or proper syntax), it hints at a feature of the framework where sensitive material (like API keys or configuration data) is handled in a “vaulted” and ethical fashion.\n\n3. Practical Considerations\n\n • Efficiency versus Safety: The goal here is to make sure that security scans introduce minimal latency. Running them in parallel or streaming helps achieve this balance. Each scanner should be as lean as possible.\n • Error Handling: When a violation is detected (either in the prompt or response), the process is interrupted. This is often critical in security-critical applications to prevent data breaches or misuse.\n • Logging and Monitoring: Good logging becomes essential for post-incident analysis and ensuring that any attempted abuse is recorded.\n\n4. Next Steps or Enhancements\n\n • Make sure that the “Vault ethically” import call uses the correct syntax; if “ethically” is a mode or parameter, check the documentation for the proper usage.\n • Validate that the scanners’ configurations (thresholds, limits, etc.) are appropriately tuned for your application’s threat model.\n • Consider how you might extend the framework with additional custom scanners if your threat model requires specialized checks.\n • Integrate robust error handling so that stoppages due to failed scans are both informative for developers and safe in production environments.\n\n5. Final Thoughts\n\nThe approach demonstrated in your snippet shows a best‐practices design for integrating security checks into LLM workflows. By scanning both inputs and outputs in near-real-time, you greatly reduce the risk of harmful or unintended content being processed or returned. For a security architect, this layered scanning methodology (combining injection prevention, token limiting, toxicity checking, and sensitivity monitoring) is a strong step toward a resilient system.\n\nIf you have any specific questions or need further details on any component (such as configuration options for each scanner or handling asynchronous calls), feel free to ask!",

Install: You can install LLM Guard directly from its GitHub source (plus openai and asyncio, if not already in your environment).\n2. Imports & Logging: Import LLMGuard, set up your loggers.\n3. Input Scanners: These scanners check the prompt before sending it to the model. In a high-stakes setting, for instance, you may include additional checks or more restrictive scanning rules.\n4. Output Scanners: These examine the token stream coming from the model. As soon as they detect disallowed, sensitive, or off-policy content, you can stop the generation to prevent further release of potentially harmful data.\n5. Vault (Optional): Vault can store secrets or logs about scanned data, which can be useful for auditing.\n6. Streaming Completion: By streaming the output rather than getting it all at once, you can cut off a problematic response mid-output to minimize risk.\n\nWith this setup, LLM Guard helps ensure the prompt is safe before forwarding to the LLM and continuously inspects the response so you can stop or transform output that violates your policies. This can be particularly critical when “lives are at stake” or in situations where output must be tightly controlled.",

By installing and using LLM Guard, you can catch issues in real time—whether it’s a malicious prompt (like injection attacks) or dangerous content being generated—before the system produces a harmful output. This is especially critical when “lives are at stake.”\n\nHere’s what the code is doing conceptually:\n\n1. Input Scanners:\n • The code imports several input scanners (Anonymize, PromptInjection, TokenLimit, Toxicity). These work in parallel with OpenAI’s completion process.\n • As the prompt is received, they check for factors like injection attempts, overly toxic or harmful language, or even too many tokens. If the prompt is deemed invalid, the scanning process stops the completion promptly and logs the error.\n\n2. Output Scanners:\n • The output scanners (Deanonymize, NoRefusal, Relevance, Sensitive) actively monitor the content as it’s generated.\n • They ensure that the output does not cross any safety or sensitivity boundaries. If any part of the generated text is flagged as invalid (for instance, if sensitive or irrelevant content starts to appear mid-stream), the scanning mechanism will interrupt the generation immediately.\n\n3. Protection in High-Stakes Situations:\n • In scenarios where every word might carry significant consequences—imagine critical advisory systems or emergency communications—the ability to stop dangerous content before it’s fully generated can literally help prevent a catastrophe.\n • Logging these events also means you maintain an audit trail for future analysis and improvements to the system.\n\n4. Setup Reminder:\n • The pip install lines indicate that LLM Guard and its dependencies (like OpenAI’s library and asyncio) need to be installed from the specified repository. This demonstrates how you can rapidly integrate these safety features into your project.\n\nIn summary, the code snippet serves as a blueprint for enhancing the safety of your language model applications. By scanning both inputs and outputs in real time, LLM Guard acts as an automated safety net—catching problematic prompts and outputs before they cause harm in high-stakes environments.",

Here’s a breakdown and a security-focused understanding of the process described:\n\n## Steps in the Example\n\n**1. Scanning the Prompt in Parallel with OpenAI Completion**\n- As soon as a user submits a prompt, you:\n  - Immediately send it to OpenAI for processing.\n  - Simultaneously (in parallel), scan the prompt for security risks (such as prompt injection, exceeding token limits, or toxicity).\n  - If the scan determines the prompt is invalid (e.g., malicious content, PII, or other policy violations), you:\n    - Interrupt or stop the OpenAI completion request.\n    - Log the error for auditing or investigation.\n- **Goal:** Prevent malicious or policy-violating prompts from being processed or reaching your LLM provider, but do so without introducing latency (because scanning happens in parallel).\n\n**2. Streaming Output Scanning**\n- As the LLM begins streaming its output:\n  - You scan each segment of output in real time (streaming mode).\n  - If you detect invalid content (e.g., sensitive data leakage, refusal to answer, irrelevant output), you:\n    - Immediately stop the completion.\n    - Optionally log, alert, or handle the violation as configured.\n- **Goal:** Catch and prevent the release of sensitive or non-compliant outputs as soon as possible, minimizing risk exposure.\n\n---\n\n## Security Considerations\n\n1. **Race Condition Risk:**  \n   - Since scanning and completion are parallel, there is a theoretical (but very small) chance the LLM could start processing an invalid prompt before a scanner blocks it. However, in practice, the speed of scanners should minimize this window, and stopping the request immediately mitigates most risk.\n\n2. **Logging and Auditing:**  \n   - All invalid prompts/outputs are logged, supporting traceability and incident response.\n\n3. **Output Streaming Protection:**  \n   - Real-time output scanning is critical for stopping data leakage or policy violations before they reach the end user.\n\n4. **Scanners Used:**  \n   - **Input scanners**: Anonymize (PII removal), PromptInjection (attack detection), TokenLimit (length control), Toxicity (abusive content).\n   - **Output scanners**: Deanonymize (detects de-anonymization), NoRefusal (ensures LLM does not refuse valid requests), Relevance (keeps output on-topic), Sensitive (prevents sensitive info leaks).\n\n5. **Vault Integration:**  \n   - The `Vault` class (from `llm_guard.vault`) typically handles secure storage and key management for sensitive data (e.g., mapping anonymized tokens).\n\n---\n\n## Summary\n\n**This approach prioritizes speed and user experience by not blocking the LLM request while scanning but ensures security by halting processing/output as soon as a violation is detected.** The scanners chosen cover common LLM security risks, and the parallel/streaming setup minimizes both risk and latency.\n\n**If you want to be even more conservative (higher security, more impact on latency), you could scan the prompt before sending it to the LLM. But the method shown is a balanced, industry-accepted approach for high-throughput, real-time applications.**\n\n---\n\nIf you need a more detailed code review or have specific threat scenarios to discuss, please provide the complete code or more context!",

If this aligns with your existing understanding, then your configuration and approach should be correct:\n\n1. Parallel Prompt Scanning  \n   • The process begins by scanning the prompt with one or more “input scanner” checks (e.g., PromptInjection, Toxicity) at the same time you submit the request to the OpenAI endpoint.  \n   • If any input scanner deems the prompt invalid (for instance, containing disallowed content or exceeding token limits), the request is halted immediately, and you can log or track that event for audit purposes.  \n   • This prevents the large language model from executing on unsafe, disallowed, or overly large input.\n\n2. Streaming Output Scanning  \n   • As soon as the model starts streaming back its output, “output scanners” (e.g., NoRefusal, Sensitive) look for unauthorized or risky responses in real time.  \n   • If an output scanner flags any part of the model’s response, you stop the stream and take action—such as terminating additional output and logging the issue.  \n   • This ensures that, if the model begins to produce content deemed invalid, you can contain it before a full response is generated or exposed to the user.\n\n3. Example Code Components  \n   • input_scanners:  \n     – Anonymize: Removes or replaces PII in the prompt.  \n     – PromptInjection: Detects prompt-injection attempts and mitigates them.  \n     – TokenLimit: Checks if the request exceeds safe token boundaries.  \n     – Toxicity: Filters out hateful or harassing language.  \n   • output_scanners:  \n     – Deanonymize: Ensures sensitive data is not reintroduced in the model’s output.  \n     – NoRefusal: Enforces behavior that the model should not simply refuse responses (depending on policy).  \n     – Relevance: Checks if responses stay on topic or meet your relevance criteria.  \n     – Sensitive: Detects leakage of sensitive or proprietary information.  \n   • Vault Usage:  \n     – The Vault in LLM Guard is typically where you securely store credentials, keys, and potentially other sensitive rules or configurations. It helps keep your scanner logic and secrets in one managed location.\n\n4. Key Benefits of This Configuration  \n   • Minimal Latency Increase: By scanning in parallel, you do not add a significant delay to prompt processing.  \n   • Fine-Grained Control: Real-time scanning of responses allows you to cut off disallowed text as soon as it appears.  \n   • Centralized Security: Scanners and policies are consolidated into a package (LLM Guard), making it easier to manage and audit.\n\nIf this describes your intended approach—scanning both the incoming request before it hits the model and the outgoing response as soon as it is generated—then your understanding of LLM Guard’s “fastest and least disruptive” usage is correct. Keep in mind that you can configure or swap out scanners at will, depending on the specific policies, risk environment, or compliance requirements your team must follow.",

          "response": "Based on the snippet and accompanying text, here’s our understanding of how LLM Guard works in this example:\n\n1. The system is designed to check both the prompt and the output in near real time, with different scanning strategies for each:\n  • For the prompt: As soon as a user prompt is received and the OpenAI completion process is kicked off, the prompt is scanned in parallel. Several scanners (such as Anonymize, PromptInjection, TokenLimit, and Toxicity) are applied to identify any problems with the input. If one of these scanners detects a violation or invalid input, then the system stops the subsequent completion and logs the error.\n  • For the output: The scanning of the generated content happens in a streaming fashion. This means that as the response is being generated and streamed out, output scanners (for example, Deanonymize, NoRefusal, Relevance, and Sensitive) monitor the content. The moment any part of the streaming output is considered invalid, the system interrupts (stops) the rest of the completion.\n\n2. The intent is to minimize the window of exposure by quickly stopping problematic completions. The prompt scanning works concurrently to catch issues from the very start, while the output scanning ensures that any potential issues emerging during generation are caught immediately.\n\n3. The installation instructions indicate that the code relies on pip packages fetched directly from a Git repository, suggesting that this is a specialized, perhaps evolving, security module.\n\n4. Logging is set up (via Python’s logging module) so that when a violation is detected (either in the prompt or output), detailed information about the error is recorded for further inspection or audit.\n\nThis implementation aims to create a robust guardrail in the LLM pipeline, ensuring both the incoming prompts and the outgoing completions are continuously checked for potentially harmful or unintended content, thereby reducing risk with minimal disruption to service. \n\nDoes this match your understanding, or is there any additional detail or clarification you need?",

Imports & Vault Setup:\n   • We import scanners from LLM Guard.\n   • The Vault import is used to securely handle sensitive details (like API keys and credentials). Replace the placeholder values with your actual required details.\n\n2. Input Scanning:\n   • scan_prompt() runs several input checks sequentially (anonymization, prompt injection, token limit, and toxicity).\n   • If any check fails (typically through an exception or error signal), the prompt is rejected and the process returns immediately.\n\n3. Output Scanning:\n   • As the output streams from OpenAI, each chunk is validated using output scanners.\n   • If a chunk is deemed invalid, we log the error and break out of the streaming loop immediately.\n\n4. OpenAI Streaming:\n   • The get_openai_completion() function demonstrates starting an asynchronous streaming call to OpenAI.\n   • Each piece of the streamed output is scanned before being processed (printed in this example).\n\n5. Running the Main Loop:\n   • The asyncio.run(main()) call ensures the asynchronous functions are properly executed.\n\nThis example provides a template that you can extend based on your actual deployment context and security requirements. Remember to secure your Vault details as per your organization’s standards, especially when operating in high-pressure emergency scenarios.",

          "response": "Absolutely, I’m happy to help! It looks like you’re referencing a quickstart example for integrating [LLM Guard](https://github.com/protectai/llm-guard) with OpenAI’s API, focusing on real-time scanning of both prompts and outputs to ensure safety and compliance.\n\nLet’s break down what’s happening and how you might use the code you posted:\n\n## **What’s the Goal?**\n\n- **Scan prompts and outputs quickly**: You want to check the prompt (user input) and the output (LLM response) for safety issues, but without adding much latency.\n- **Minimal disruption**: If a prompt or output is unsafe, you stop processing immediately.\n\n---\n\n## **How It Works (Step By Step)**\n\n### **1. Scan Prompt in Parallel**\n\n- **Parallel processing**: As soon as you receive a prompt, you send it to both LLM Guard (for scanning) and OpenAI's API (for generating a response) at the same time.\n- **Early stop**: If LLM Guard flags the prompt as unsafe (e.g., too toxic, too long, or containing prompt injection), you immediately halt the OpenAI request and log the incident.\n\n### **2. Stream Output Scans**\n\n- **Streaming output**: As the LLM generates output (using OpenAI’s streaming API), you scan each chunk as it arrives.\n- **Immediate stop**: If any part of the output is unsafe (e.g., it de-anonymizes, refuses to answer, is irrelevant, or contains sensitive info), you halt further output and log the issue.\n\n---\n\n## **Key LLM Guard Components Used**\n\n- `Anonymize`, `PromptInjection`, `TokenLimit`, `Toxicity`: Scan the prompt for privacy, injection attacks, length, and toxicity.\n- `Deanonymize`, `NoRefusal`, `Relevance`, `Sensitive`: Scan the output for accidental leaks, LLM refusal, irrelevance, or sensitive data.\n- `Vault`: A secure storage for secrets/tokens that can be referenced in your scans.\n\n---\n\n## **Typical Usage Skeleton**\n\nHere's how you might structure your code (simplified):\n\n```python\nimport asyncio\nfrom llm_guard.input_scanners import Anonymize, PromptInjection, TokenLimit, Toxicity\nfrom llm_guard.output_scanners import Deanonymize, NoRefusal, Relevance, Sensitive\nfrom llm_guard.vault import Vault\n\n# Set up scanners\ninput_scanners = [\n    Anonymize(), PromptInjection(), TokenLimit(max_tokens=4096), Toxicity()\n]\noutput_scanners = [\n    Deanonymize(), NoRefusal(), Relevance(), Sensitive()\n]\nvault = Vault()\n\nasync def scan_prompt(prompt):\n    for scanner in input_scanners:\n        is_valid, _ = scanner.scan(prompt)\n        if not is_valid:\n            # Log error, take action\n            return False\n    return True\n\nasync def scan_output(output_stream):\n    for chunk in output_stream:\n        for scanner in output_scanners:\n            is_valid, _ = scanner.scan(chunk)\n            if not is_valid:\n                # Stop streaming, log error\n                return False\n    return True\n\nasync def main(prompt):\n    prompt_valid = await scan_prompt(prompt)\n    if not prompt_valid:\n        print(\"Prompt failed validation.\")\n        return\n\n    # Begin OpenAI streaming here (pseudo-code!)\n    async for chunk in openai_stream(prompt):\n        output_valid = await scan_output([chunk])\n        if not output_valid:\n            print(\"Output failed validation.\")\n            break\n        print(chunk, end='')\n\n# Usage\nasyncio.run(main(\"Your prompt here\"))\n```\n\n---\n\n## **What You Need To Do**\n\n- Install dependencies (use the pip command you posted).\n- Set up your scanners as needed for your application.\n- Use async to run prompt/output scans in parallel with OpenAI calls.\n- Handle errors/logging as you see fit.\n\n---\n\n### **Let me know if you want:**\n\n- A more complete example (with OpenAI API calls included)\n- A synchronous (non-async) version\n- Guidance on configuring specific scanners\n\nJust ask!",

          "response": "Below is an overview of how LLM Guard works based on the example you shared, with some context on each step. Even though you only posted a short script, I’ll walk through the concepts of how LLM Guard is intended to be integrated and why the example is structured the way it is.\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n1. Basic installation\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n• pip install llm_guard@git+https://github.com/protectai/llm-guard.git  \n• pip install openai asyncio  \n\nAs you likely know, “pip install llm_guard@git+…” pulls the latest version from the GitHub repository. Because LLM Guard is still an early-stage project, installing directly from GitHub is often recommended to keep up-to-date with the newest features and bug fixes. You’ll of course also need the openai library to interact with OpenAI’s API, and asyncio to handle asynchronous tasks.\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n2. Imports\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nimport logging\n\nfrom llm_guard.input_scanners import Anonymize, PromptInjection, TokenLimit, Toxicity\nfrom llm_guard.output_scanners import Deanonymize, NoRefusal, Relevance, Sensitive\nfrom llm_guard.vault import Vault\n\nHere’s an overview of these imported scanners and the Vault mechanism:\n\n• Anonymize – This typically replaces or masks sensitive user-provided data (like names, emails, phone numbers) within the prompt.  \n• PromptInjection – Looks for suspicious or manipulative content in prompts (e.g., attempts to override system instructions).  \n• TokenLimit – Enforces or checks the length of the prompt; ensures it’s within a desired character or token limit.  \n• Toxicity – Scans for offensive or harmful language (e.g., hate speech, harassment, or other categories recognized by the classifier).\n\nMeanwhile, for output scanners:\n\n• Deanonymize – Often used to ensure that certain sensitive information, which might have been anonymized in the prompt, is also redacted from the output or replaced in a consistent way.  \n• NoRefusal – Looks out for “refusal statements” in the model’s output. Sometimes you don’t want the model to reply with “I refuse to …” or “I’m sorry, I can’t do that,” depending on policy or use case.  \n• Relevance – Checks whether the model’s output is relevant to the prompt or has gone off-topic.  \n• Sensitive – Used to detect personal unique info or PII (personally identifiable information) and ensure it doesn’t get exposed in the output.\n\nLastly, the Vault is typically used to store (or control) sensitive data, such as API keys or other credentials, within your code or environment. If you’re building a production service, you want these stored in a secure manner—sometimes LLM Guard can help manage and protect them against accidental exposure.\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n3. Parallel prompt scanning\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nIn the example snippet, the code suggests scanning the incoming prompt in parallel with obtaining the OpenAI completion. The typical flow might look something like:\n\n1) Prompt is received.  \n2) The scanners (PromptInjection, Anonymize, Toxicity, etc.) analyze the prompt in real time.  \n3) If the prompt is deemed invalid (it contains disallowed content, triggers policy concerns, or passes a certain threshold for toxicity), you log the issue and stop calling the OpenAI API.  \n4) Otherwise, you let the request go through to the LLM in parallel.\n\nThe advantage of scanning in parallel is a performance gain—rather than doing a blocking check first, you can effectively do both the prompt check and the LLM request. But note that if the prompt is eventually flagged, your code should have the ability to terminate or not return the LLM response.\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n4. Streaming output scanning\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nThe second step is to scan the model’s output in a streaming fashion. This means:\n\n1) You request the LLM’s completion in streaming mode (if using OpenAI’s ChatCompletion.create(stream=True, …)).  \n2) As the tokens arrive, each chunk of text is analyzed by the output scanners (Relevance, Sensitive, NoRefusal, etc.).  \n3) If something invalid is detected (e.g., the model is about to leak PII or starts producing hateful content), the stream is halted immediately and optionally replaced with a safe message or partial answer.\n\nThis real-time or near-real-time interception helps keep your final user-facing content safe and policy-compliant.\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n5. Why it’s the “fastest and least disruptive”\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n• Parallel scanning of the prompt: Because it happens simultaneously with the generation of the LLM token stream, you avoid waiting for a separate pre-processing step.  \n• Early stopping of invalid output: You don’t need to generate the full response before you decide it’s invalid. Instead, you stop as soon as any chunk fails a scanner check.\n\nAll of this ensures minimal overhead in how quickly you can serve responses while still maintaining boundaries, compliance, and user protection.\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n6. General usage tips\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nBelow is a rough usage outline, though many details will depend on the exact code:\n\nvault = Vault(...)\n# Potentially configure your vault, possibly with environment variables:\n# vault.add_key(\"OPENAI_API_KEY\", \"your-secret-key\")\n\nasync def handle_request(prompt: str):\n    # Apply input scanners\n    combined_scanner = [Anonymize(), PromptInjection(), Toxicity(), TokenLimit(max_tokens=2000)]\n    scanned_prompt = await run_scanners_on_prompt(prompt, combined_scanner)\n\n    if scanned_prompt.invalid:\n        logging.error(f\"Prompt error: {scanned_prompt.issue_message}\")\n        return {\"error\": \"Invalid prompt\"}\n\n    # Prepare parameters for the OpenAI request\n    # e.g. { \"model\": \"gpt-3.5-turbo\", \"prompt\": scanned_prompt.cleaned_text, ... }\n    # Make the generation call in streaming mode\n\n    # For each token chunk:\n    #    run output scanners\n    #    if any scanner is triggered -> stop\n\n    return final_answer\n\nThis structure ties together the input scanning, transformation (anonymizing), the call to the model, and the output scanning.  \n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nConclusion\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nLLM Guard’s concept is straightforward: you intercept (and optionally scrub) text on its way into the model and on its way out. By scanning both directions, you ensure the conversation remains within safe, compliant boundaries. The snippet you posted is a concise demonstration of how to configure your input and output scanners so you can quickly halt or warn on risky text — making this approach “the fastest and least disruptive” for your application’s users.\n\nI hope this clarifies how the snippet and the library work!

The same logic applies, but you’ll tailor the code to your particular framework.",

          "response": "Thanks for sharing the snippet and context—I'm happy to walk through what’s happening and how LLM Guard is being used here.\n\nThis example demonstrates one way to integrate safety and quality checks into your language model (LLM) interactions with minimal impact on latency. The idea is to scan both the prompt you send to the model and the model’s streamed output using a set of configurable “scanners” that enforce different safety rules. Here’s a breakdown of the major points:\n\n1. Prompt Scanning (Parallel to the LLM Completion)\n   • The code sets up scanners for the input (prompt) such as:\n  – Anonymize: Likely ensures personal or sensitive information is handled appropriately.\n  – PromptInjection: Checks for attempts to insert malicious instructions that could alter the model’s intended behavior.\n  – TokenLimit: Enforces a limit on the number of tokens to prevent overly long or unwieldy prompts.\n  – Toxicity: Analyzes the prompt for language that might be harmful or offensive.\n   • The key idea is that as soon as you start the LLM completion, you are simultaneously scanning the incoming prompt. If the prompt violates any of your rules, the process is immediately stopped and an error is logged. This “stop early” approach minimizes wasted compute on unsafe or tainted inputs.\n\n2. Output Scanning (Streamed Mode)\n   • For the model’s output, the code uses scanners that work in a streaming fashion:\n  – Deanonymize: Possibly checks that no accidental data anonymization happens or reverses prior anonymization if needed.\n  – NoRefusal: Ensures the model isn’t refusing to answer in a way that bypasses your safety/error handling.\n  – Relevance: Checks that the output stays on topic and doesn’t diverge into unsafe territory.\n  – Sensitive: Flags or stops outputs that might contain sensitive material.\n   • Streaming mode means that rather than waiting for the full output, each chunk of generated text is quickly inspected. If at any point the output is found to be invalid, the generation stops immediately. This provides a real-time safeguard against generating harmful content.\n\n3. Overall Integration and Performance\n   • This setup is designed for speed: by performing the input checks in parallel with the LLM request and the output checks incrementally, the entire guard mechanism remains as unobtrusive as possible.\n   • The trade-off is that you’re adding additional processing overhead (for example, using modules from llm_guard.input_scanners and llm_guard.output_scanners) but with careful design, you mitigate any significant impact on latency while greatly enhancing the safety profile of your interactions.\n\n4. Installation & Setup\n   • The commented pip install lines indicate that you need to install llm_guard directly from the GitHub repository (this might be a bleeding-edge version) as well as the OpenAI and asyncio libraries.\n   • The Vault module (from llm_guard.vault) likely provides secure storage for API keys, credentials, configurations, or possibly reference datasets needed by the scanners.\n\nIn summary, this approach—scanning both inputs and outputs—ensures that if anything goes awry (e.g., a malicious prompt or unexpected output), your system can halt and log the incident quickly without waiting for a full response. The combination of parallel and streaming checks helps maintain guardrails over the LLM’s behavior while minimizing delays in generating responses.\n\nIf you have any further questions about how each scanner works or how to integrate this approach into your own projects, feel free to ask!",

I'm always happy to help with questions related to language models and their responsible use.\n\nThe code snippet you provided demonstrates a great example of how to use the LLM Guard library to ensure the safety and reliability of language model outputs. Let me break down the key points:\n\n1. **Parallel Prompt Scanning**: The code starts by scanning the input prompt in parallel with the OpenAI completion request. This allows for early detection of any issues with the prompt, such as potential prompt injections or token limits. If the prompt is found to be invalid, the completion is stopped, and the error is logged.\n\n2. **Streaming Output Scanning**: The code then scans the output in streaming mode, which means that the output is checked as it is being generated, rather than waiting for the full completion. This allows for faster detection of any issues, and the completion can be stopped as soon as an invalid output is detected.\n\n3. **Scanning Techniques**: The code uses several input and output scanners provided by the LLM Guard library, including:\n   - **Anonymize**: Ensures that the input prompt does not contain any sensitive personal information.\n   - **PromptInjection**: Detects and blocks potential prompt injections.\n   - **TokenLimit**: Enforces a maximum token limit for the input prompt.\n   - **Toxicity**: Checks the input prompt for toxic or harmful content.\n   - **Deanonymize**: Ensures that the output does not contain any sensitive personal information.\n   - **NoRefusal**: Ensures that the output does not contain any refusals to complete the task.\n   - **Relevance**: Checks the output for relevance to the input prompt.\n   - **Sensitive**: Detects and blocks sensitive or inappropriate content in the output.\n\n4. **Vault**: The code also makes use of the Vault module, which is a secure storage mechanism for sensitive data, such as API keys or other credentials.\n\nThis is a great example of how to use the LLM Guard library to implement a robust and secure language model workflow. By combining parallel prompt scanning, streaming output scanning, and a variety of scanning techniques, you can ensure that your language model outputs are safe, reliable, and aligned with your specific requirements.\n\nIf you have any further questions or need additional assistance, please feel free to reach out.

Prompt Scanning in Parallel  \n   In scan_prompt_in_parallel, each input scanner (TokenLimit, Toxicity, etc.) receives the user’s prompt for validation. If any scanner deems the prompt invalid, we raise an exception and discard the request.\n\n3. Output Scanning in Streaming Mode  \n   The openai_stream_with_output_scanners function requests a streaming completion from OpenAI and processes each chunk of text as it arrives. Each output scanner checks the chunk; if it fails, we stop streaming and log the issue.\n\n4. Minimal Overhead, Early Interruption  \n   Because we scan the prompt concurrently with requesting a completion from OpenAI (or very early in the process) and abort the streaming output as soon as we detect invalid content, we achieve fast and minimal disruption in a production setting.\n\n5. Execution  \n   Run ./llm_guard_example.py --prompt \"Some prompt\"  \n   You can set your OpenAI key in an environment variable named OPENAI_API_KEY or hard-code in Vault. Then watch the logs for any flagged issues.",

The script first configures the OpenAI API key and sets up the LLM Guard scanners for both the input and output.\n2. The `generate_text` function is an asynchronous function that takes a prompt as input and generates text using OpenAI's completion API.\n3. Inside the `generate_text` function, the prompt is first scanned in parallel using the input scanners. If any of the scanners detect an invalid prompt, the completion is stopped, and an error is logged.\n4. If the prompt is valid, the function generates text using OpenAI's completion API in streaming mode.\n5. During the text generation, the output is scanned in streaming mode using the output scanners. If any of the scanners detect an invalid output, the completion is stopped, and an error is logged.\n6. The `main` function sets up the prompt and calls the `generate_text` function to generate the text.\n\nThis implementation demonstrates how to use LLM Guard to scan the input prompt and output in the fastest and least disruptive way possible, by running the scans in parallel with the OpenAI completion and stopping the completion as soon as an invalid input or output is detected.",

Mapping Properties\n\nThe mapping properties of a function describe how elements from the domain (Input) are related to elements in the codomain (Output). Here, assuming **f** is a function that takes the provided string and returns some processed result (Output), the mapping has these general properties:\n\n#### a. Well-defined\nFor each Input (i.e., for the given string), there is **exactly one Output** produced by **f**.\n\n#### b. Deterministic\nGiven the same Input, **f** will always produce the same Output.\n\n#### c. Total\nIf **f** is defined for all possible Inputs of the given form (i.e., any string), then it is a **total function**. If it only works for some subset, it is **partial**.\n\n#### d. Injective (One-to-One)\nIf **f** maps different Inputs to different Outputs, it is **injective**. In this context, unless **f** discards or normalizes the input, it's likely injective for unique strings.\n\n#### e. Surjective (Onto)\n**f** is surjective if every possible Output is mapped from some Input. This depends on how Output is defined (e.g., if Output is all possible processed strings).\n\n#### f. Composition\nIf **f** is composed of several processing steps (e.g., scanning for prompt injection, anonymizing, etc.), then **f** can be seen as a composition of these individual functions:\n```\nf = fₙ ∘ ... ∘ f₂ ∘ f₁\n```\nwhere each fᵢ is one of the scanners or processing steps.\n\n#### g. Preservation of Structure\nIf **f** preserves some structure of the Input (e.g., the ordering of sentences, or paragraph breaks), then it is said to be structure-preserving.\n\n### 3. Example in Context\n\nGiven the context (usage of LLM Guard and its scanners), the function **f** could be:\n- **f(input) = processed_output**, where processed_output is the result after input passes through a pipeline of scanners (e.g., checking for prompt injection, anonymizing, token limit checks, toxicity filtering, etc.).\n- Each scanner acts as a sub-function, possibly transforming or validating the input.\n\n#### Mapping Properties in this Context\n\n- **f** is deterministic and well-defined for each (valid) string input.\n- If the pipeline rejects invalid prompts, **f** might map multiple \"invalid\" Inputs to a single Output (e.g., an error message), meaning **f** is not injective in this case.\n- If the pipeline only modifies, but never rejects, Inputs, and different Inputs map to different Outputs, then **f** is injective.\n- **f** is compositional, as it can be seen as a sequence of sub-functions.\n\n---\n\n**Summary Table:**\n\n| Property      | Holds?                         | Notes                                                                    |\n|---------------|-------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Well-defined  | Yes                            | One output for each input                                                |\n| Deterministic | Yes                            | Same input → same output                                                 |\n| Injective     | Maybe                          | If different invalid inputs map to same error, not injective             |\n| Surjective    | Maybe                          | Depends on Output set definition                                         |\n| Total         | Maybe                          | If not defined for all strings, partial                                  |\n| Compositional | Yes                            | Built from sequence of sub-functions (scanners)                          |\n| Structure-preserving | Maybe                   | Depends on implementation (does it keep formatting, etc.?)               |\n\nIf you want to define **f** concretely, you'll need to specify exactly how Input is mapped to Output (e.g., \"Output is the input string with sensitive info removed and errors raised for prompt injection\").

          "response": "Below is one way to define the function f: Input → Output and describe its mapping properties based on the example and scanners referenced. The goal is to capture both the “what” (the domain, codomain, and overall transformation) and the “how” (the conditions under which the function may halt, produce warnings, or otherwise modify the input):\n\n──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n1. Domain (Input)\n──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n• The domain of f is all text strings that may be provided as prompts to an LLM (Large Language Model).\n• In the context of the example, the input is the user’s prompt text plus any relevant configuration or metadata used by LLM Guard. For instance:\n  \n  \"In this example, we demonstrate how to use LLM Guard in the fastest and …\"\n\n  is a sample of such prompt text.\n\n──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n2. Codomain (Output)\n──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n• The codomain consists of:\n  – Valid completions or responses from the LLM.  \n  – Error states or exceptions (e.g., if the prompt is deemed invalid).\n  – Optionally, partial output if a violation of output scanning rules is detected mid-stream and the completion is halted.\n\nIn other words, f can produce:\n  • A normal “valid” response (the LLM’s completion).\n  • A special error or “stop” response.\n\n──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n3. Overview of the Function f\n──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nWe can define f in two major phases: input scanning and output scanning. These phases run in a nearly parallel/streaming workflow in LLM Guard, but mathematically, each phase describes constraints under which the function continues or halts.\n\nPhase A: Input Scanning\n---------------------------------\nGiven an input string x:\n  1. Anonymize: Removes or redacts personal identifiers from x if found.\n  2. PromptInjection: Checks whether x attempts to override or subvert system instructions (prompt injection).\n  3. TokenLimit: Ensures that x does not exceed certain token or size limits.\n  4. Toxicity: Checks x for toxic or disallowed content.\n\nIf any scanner from this set deems x invalid, f immediately returns an error (and does not continue to an LLM request). Thus, from a functional standpoint:\n\n  f_A(x) =  \n    • STOP (with logged error)  if x fails any input scanner;  \n    • x' (possibly transformed) if x is valid.\n\nPhase B: Output Scanning\n---------------------------------\nIf x passes input scanning, we forward x to the LLM. Let g(x) be the LLM’s raw streaming output. As the output is streamed, it is scanned in real-time:\n\n  1. Deanonymize: Reverts anonymized content back if needed (only in restricted or controlled contexts).\n  2. NoRefusal: Ensures that the LLM does not refuse unexpectedly; if it does, we handle it according to policy.\n  3. Relevance: Checks whether the output is on-topic given the prompt.\n  4. Sensitive: Monitors if the output contains sensitive or disallowed content.\n\nIf any output token from g(x) fails these checks, the output streaming is stopped. In functional form:\n\n  f_B(g(x)) =  \n    • Partial or truncated response (with a STOP) if any scanner is violated mid-stream;  \n    • Complete final response y if all tokens pass successfully.\n\n──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n4. Composite Mapping\n──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nGiven the two-phase framework:\n\n     f = f_B ○ g ○ f_A\n\nwhere f_A is the set of input scans (possibly transforming x to x′ or halting), g is the LLM generation from x′ to output tokens, and f_B is the set of output scans (which may stream, transform, or halt the output). Thus:\n\n  1. f_A: x → x′ or STOP\n  2. g: x′ → tokens of LLM output\n  3. f_B: tokens → final y or partial STOP\n\n──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n5. Mapping Properties\n──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n• Partial Function Behavior:\n  – f is not guaranteed to produce a normal completion for every x in the domain; it will produce a STOP or error if the input violates any input scanners or if the output violates any output scanners. Hence, it behaves like a partial function: not every input text has a valid output.\n\n• Non-Destructive Transformation (Under Valid Inputs):\n  – If the input passes all input scanners, the LLM will receive the prompt text in its (possibly slightly sanitized) form. Only minimal transformations are applied (e.g., anonymization or token-limiting).\n\n• Short-Circuit Behavior:\n  – The output scanning is in streaming mode, so any invalid output token halts the function immediately. This prevents the LLM from producing disallowed text beyond the violation point.\n\n• Categorical Output:\n  – The final result is either a fully valid response from the LLM or a truncated/error response indicating a policy violation.\n\n• Logging and Audit:\n  – Each scanner can log or record its decisions. This ensures f retains a trace of how and why halting occurred, if it does.\n\n──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n6. Concluding Summary\n──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nThe function f: Input → Output defined by the above logic sends prompts to an LLM while enforcing constraints on both the prompt (input) and the completion (output). Any violation in the input scanning phase stops the function before the LLM is called; any violation in the output scanning phase stops the generation in mid-stream.\n\nEffectively, f transforms a user’s prompt into a validated or denied request and provides a corresponding safe output if possible.",

          "response": "We can think of f as a “safe‐completion” function that takes a (possibly dangerous) prompt (with associated code and instructions) and returns an output (a generated completion) only if the input and output both pass a series of safety and correctness checks. In our example, the input is a string (with a description and code comments) that tells us to use LLM Guard to monitor and “safeguard” the interaction with an LLM. The mapping f, from Input → Output, has several notable properties:\n\n1. Dual (or staged) validation:\n • Before any generation begins, f examines the prompt in real time using several input scanners (like Anonymize, PromptInjection, TokenLimit, and Toxicity). This early check is performed in parallel with the request to the LLM. If any of these checks fail, f effectively becomes undefined on that branch because it stops the generation and logs the error.\n • As the LLM generates text, f also scans the output in a streaming fashion using output scanners (such as Deanonymize, NoRefusal, Relevance, and Sensitive). The function f is designed so that if at any moment the output violates any of the check criteria, the generation is halted immediately.\n\n2. Partiality:\n • f is not total over all possible inputs. If the prompt does not meet the “safety and validity” conditions, no full output is produced—in other words, f is only defined for inputs that pass its defensive criteria.\n • Similarly, even if the prompt is acceptable, the mapping may terminate prematurely (yielding no valid full output) if the output, when streaming, deviates from the allowed behavior.\n\n3. Asynchronous and Parallel Behavior:\n • The input is validated “in parallel” with the generation of the LLM response; this implies a concurrent control flow where f monitors both the incoming prompt and the streaming output simultaneously.\n • This design minimizes disruption—that is, it stops an unsafe generation as soon as possible, ensuring that a violation in either the input or output is caught immediately.\n\n4. Safety Invariance:\n • f enforces invariants related to what is “safe” or “allowed.” Before generation starts, it guarantees no prompt injection or toxic content is present, and during generation it continually ensures that the output remains within content boundaries.\n • The function effectively maps an input into an output that respects these safety conditions; if any condition is about to be breached the function “refuses” to continue, ensuring that unsafe material is never fully generated.\n\n5. Logging and Error Handling:\n • Along the mapping from Input to Output, f is responsible for not only conditionally allowing a completion to be produced but also for logging errors (or violations). This property is important for diagnosing issues with both the prompt and the streaming result.\n\nIn summary, the function f can be characterized as a guarded transformation with these mapping properties:\n\n – Domain: All strings that represent either valid or possibly unsafe prompts and associated instructions.\n – Codomain: Strings produced by the LLM (or no output at all) that are guaranteed to meet predefined safety criteria.\n – Partiality: f may be undefined (or yield an explicit “rejection” signal) where the prompt or intermediate output is unsafe.\n – Concurrency: f’s behavior relies on simultaneous (parallel) evaluation of the input prompt and streaming output.\n – Safety enforcement: f intervenes as soon as a breach (either pre- or post-generation) is detected, preventing unsafe completions.\n\nThus, f is not a mere static transformation but a dynamic, safety-ensuring mapping that continuously monitors and validates both the input and the output, ensuring that only “clean” completions are eventually returned.",

These checks may include:\n   - **Anonymize**: Ensures sensitive data in the prompt is anonymized.\n   - **PromptInjection**: Detects attempts at prompt injection attacks.\n   - **TokenLimit**: Ensures the input prompt length (in tokens) meets predefined limits.\n   - **Toxicity**: Detects toxic or harmful content in the prompt.\n\n   - If any of these checks fail (prompt is invalid), the function immediately halts the process, logs an error, and returns an \"invalid prompt error.\"\n\n2. **Prompt Completion (Conditional)**:  \n   If the prompt passes all input checks, the prompt is simultaneously sent to OpenAI's completion endpoint. The completion process starts generating outputs.\n\n3. **Output Validation (Streaming Check)**:  \n   The output stream from the completion is continuously scanned by output scanners provided by LLM Guard. These output scanners include:\n   - **Deanonymize**: Checks to prevent leakage of previously anonymized data.\n   - **NoRefusal**: Ensures the model does not refuse to answer valid prompts.\n   - **Relevance**: Validates that the generated content remains relevant to the input prompt.\n   - **Sensitive**: Detects sensitive or inappropriate information in the output.\n\n   - If the ongoing (streaming) output violates any of these conditions, the function immediately stops the completion, logs the violation, and returns an \"invalid output error.\"\n\n4. **Successful Completion**:  \n   If the generated output passes all output scanners successfully, the function returns the fully validated output completion string.\n\n### Summary of Mapping Properties:\n\n- **Partiality**:  \n  The function is partial; not every input necessarily yields a valid output. Some inputs may map directly to errors due to security or validation violations.\n\n- **Non-injective**:  \n  Multiple distinct prompts may potentially map to the same type of error (e.g., \"invalid prompt error\"), thus the function is not injective.\n\n- **Non-surjective**:  \n  Not every possible completion or error category will necessarily occur; thus, the function is not guaranteed to be surjective onto the entire codomain.\n\n- **Security-Oriented (Safety Checks)**:  \n  The mapping explicitly prioritizes safety and security of both input prompts and output completions, enforcing strict validation criteria.\n\n### Example Mapping Illustration:\n\n- Valid Prompt → Valid Completion  \n- Invalid Prompt → \"invalid prompt error\"  \n- Valid Prompt + Invalid Streaming Output → \"invalid output error\"\n\nHence, the function \\( f \\) acts as a secure validation and filtering mechanism, ensuring both the prompt and its generated outputs comply with defined security policies and constraints.",

The key idea is to secure both the prompt (input) and the generated text (output) by scanning for potential issues and stopping the generation process if any violations are found. Here’s a breakdown of what’s happening:\n\n1. The sample text explains that the LLM Guard system works in two phases:\n   • It scans the prompt in parallel with the OpenAI completion. If the prompt is identified as invalid (for example, if it appears to include prompt-injection attempts or exceeds token limits), the completion process is halted and an error is logged.\n   • It streams the output through a scanner. If at any point the generated output is deemed invalid (perhaps due to sensitive content, toxicity, or irrelevance), the streaming process is terminated immediately.\n\n2. The provided pip install commands indicate that you need to install both LLM Guard (from its GitHub repository) and OpenAI’s SDK along with asyncio support.\n\n3. The code snippet imports several classes:\n   • Input scanners from llm_guard.input_scanners:\n     – Anonymize: Likely used to mask or strip out sensitive personal data in the prompt.\n     – PromptInjection: Likely used to detect if a prompt is trying to manipulate or override model behavior.\n     – TokenLimit: Checks that the input stays within a safe token count.\n     – Toxicity: Detects harmful or toxic language in the input.\n   • Output scanners from llm_guard.output_scanners:\n     – Deanonymize: Possibly restores redacted portions of the text in a controlled way.\n     – NoRefusal: Ensures that outputs are not improperly refusing valid requests.\n     – Relevance: Checks that the output is aligned with the input in terms of content and context.\n     – Sensitive: Detects any sensitive content in the output.\n   • It also imports Vault from llm_guard.vault, which could be used to safely store or manage secrets (like API keys or other sensitive configuration details).\n\n4. The overall approach is to run safety checks concurrently with text generation so that any potential issues can be intercepted early. This dual-layer approach (scanning both input and output) helps in minimizing disruptions while guarding against harmful behaviors.\n\nThis code isn’t a complete script by itself—it serves as an illustrative excerpt showing how to set up and leverage LLM Guard components in your project. You would need to incorporate these scanners into the flow where your prompt is submitted to your language model (e.g., OpenAI’s API) and where the responses are received and processed.\n\nIn summary, the example outlines a strategy to protect LLM interactions effectively and securely by integrating real-time scanning mechanisms both before and during text generation.",

This example does the following:\n\n1. Scans the prompt in parallel with the OpenAI completion request.  \n2. If the prompt fails the checks, it prevents the OpenAI request from going through.  \n3. Streams the OpenAI completion.  \n4. Stops the stream (and logs the error) if the output triggers any scanner rule during streaming.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nExample: Fastest & Least Disruptive Usage of LLM Guard\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nimport asyncio\nimport logging\nimport openai\n\n# LLM Guard imports\nfrom llm_guard import LLMGuard\nfrom llm_guard.input_scanners import Anonymize, PromptInjection, TokenLimit, Toxicity\nfrom llm_guard.output_scanners import Deanonymize, NoRefusal, Relevance, Sensitive\nfrom llm_guard.vault import Vault\n\n# Configure logging\nlogging.basicConfig(\n    level=logging.INFO,\n    format=\"%(asctime)s [%(levelname)s] %(name)s - %(message)s\"\n)\n\n# Store your OpenAI key in the Vault (or configure vault with environment variables)\nVault.store_secret(\"OPENAI_API_KEY\", \"<YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY>\")\n\n# Define your input scanners\ninput_scanners = [\n    Anonymize(),       # Example: Anonymizes personal info\n    PromptInjection(), # Example: Scans for prompt-injection attempts\n    TokenLimit(max_tokens=3000),  # Example: Quick token limit check\n    Toxicity(threshold=0.8)       # Example: Checks for aggressive/offensive language\n]\n\n# Define your output scanners\noutput_scanners = [\n    Deanonymize(),  # Revert anonymization, if needed\n    NoRefusal(),    # Example rule to detect refusal text\n    Relevance(),    # Example rule to check if answer is relevant\n    Sensitive(),    # Example rule for sensitive info\n]\n\nasync def prompt_and_stream():\n    # Some prompt to send to the language model\n    prompt_text = \"Explain how LLM Guard can check content for safety in real-time.\"\n\n    # Create an LLMGuard instance\n    guard = LLMGuard(\n        input_scanners=input_scanners,\n        output_scanners=output_scanners,\n        openai_api_key=Vault.get_secret(\"OPENAI_API_KEY\")\n    )\n\n    # 1. Validate the prompt (in parallel) before sending to OpenAI\n    try:\n        guard.validate_prompt(prompt_text)\n    except Exception as e:\n        logging.error(f\"Prompt Validation Error: {e}\")\n        return\n\n    # 2.

Prompt Scanning in Parallel:\n   • We initialize the LLMGuard instance with the desired input scanners.  \n   • Before sending the prompt to the OpenAI API, guard.validate_prompt(prompt_text) runs the checks (Anonymize, PromptInjection, TokenLimit, Toxicity, etc.).  \n   • If a rule is violated (e.g., prompt injection or excessive token usage), we raise an Exception and skip the OpenAI request.\n\n2. Streaming the Fetched Response:\n   • guard.stream_completion(...) makes the actual OpenAI completion request with streaming enabled.  \n   • Each token returned by the OpenAI API goes through the configured output scanners (Deanonymize, NoRefusal, Relevance, Sensitive, etc.).  \n   • If a rule is triggered (for example, if the content is determined to be too sensitive), the stream is stopped, and an exception is raised.\n\n3. Handling Errors:\n   • Any exception from the prompt or output scanners is caught and logged.  \n   • This ensures you can gracefully handle invalid inputs or outputs without waiting for an entire response to finish generating.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nNotes\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n• Adjust the input/output scanners to meet your specific workflow needs.  \n• Make sure to replace <YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY> with your actual API key or store it in a secure location (environment variable, Vault, etc.).  \n• The scanning thresholds (for instance, in Toxicity) or the triggers (e.g., NoRefusal) can be customized.  \n• This streaming approach means you do not receive the entire response first; each token is checked on-the-fly, giving you the fastest possible reaction to invalid outputs.",

It installs the required packages:\n  • LLM Guard (from the GitHub repository)  \n  • OpenAI and asyncio libraries\n\n2. It imports specific modules from LLM Guard:\n  • Input scanners:  \n   – Anonymize: Likely used to remove or mask sensitive information from inputs.  \n   – PromptInjection: Detects if the input prompt has been tampered with or includes malicious instructions.  \n   – TokenLimit: Ensures that the prompt does not exceed a specified token limit.  \n   – Toxicity: Checks the prompt for harmful or toxic content.\n  • Output scanners:  \n   – Deanonymize: Undoes anonymization if necessary (e.g., to re-map data safely when returning results).  \n   – NoRefusal: Prevents the system from outputting refusals that might be undesired in certain settings.  \n   – Relevance: Monitors output for relevance to the prompt or expected subject matter.  \n   – Sensitive: Checks if the output includes sensitive content that should be handled differently.\n  • Vault: Manages sensitive credentials or configuration values in a secure way.\n\n3. The workflow described in the comments is as follows:\n  • The input prompt is scanned concurrently with the generation process. If any part of the prompt fails validation (for instance, due to prompt injection or toxicity), the generation is halted immediately and an error is logged.\n  • In streaming mode, as the output is generated chunk by chunk, it is continuously scanned. If any chunk of output is deemed invalid (for reasons like irrelevance or inappropriate content), the ongoing generation is stopped.\n\nThis pattern minimizes latency by not interrupting the model's primary functions unless necessary, while providing real-time monitoring and safety checks on both the input and output.\n\nIf you need further details on how to integrate or customize the scanners for your specific use case, feel free to ask!",

Prompt Scanning in Parallel (Pre-check):  \n   • Each input scanner runs on the prompt to detect issues, such as potential prompt injection, toxic content, or overlong input.  \n   • If the prompt fails any check, you can stop immediately or modify the prompt.  \n\n2. Output Scanning in Streaming Mode:  \n   • When streaming tokens from the model, LLM Guard checks each chunk of text.  \n   • If at any point the output violates a policy (e.g., reveals sensitive information), you can immediately stop streaming and handle the violation (log, raise an error, or modify the text).  \n\n3. Minimal Disruption:  \n   • Because the scanning runs in parallel (for prompts) and in real time (for output), your existing request/response workflow remains nearly the same. You only need to insert the scanning steps where appropriate.  \n\nAdditional Tips:\n\n• You can create your own custom scanners by subclassing llm_guard’s BaseScanner classes if you have more specialized policies.  \n• The Vault is optional but helpful if you want to manage secrets, references, or placeholders that should not leak in logs or to end users.  \n• Feel free to mix and match the scanners in any order or number depending on your exact requirements.  \n\nWith this approach, you can ensure your prompt is valid before calling the model and your output meets specific safety or content requirements in real time.",

          "response": "Below is an explanation of the sample provided, which demonstrates one way to integrate LLM Guard into your application. The idea behind LLM Guard is to perform quick, parallel checks on both the incoming prompt and the outgoing response to catch issues early and halt processing when needed. This minimizes disruption while improving safety and compliance with any restrictions.\n\nThe sample lays out two main steps:\n\n1. Checking the prompt:  \n • Before sending a prompt to the OpenAI completion endpoint, the system scans the prompt using several built‐in scanners (for example, checking for token limit issues, any prompt injection attempts, unwanted toxic content, or other anomalies).  \n • If one of these checks finds that the prompt is invalid – for instance, if it contains prohibited content or a malformed request – the processing is immediately stopped and the error is logged. This ensures that no unsafe or unintended instructions are processed by the model.\n\n2. Scanning the output:  \n • Once the model begins streaming the output, additional scanners run in parallel to watch for unwanted behavior in the generated text (such as deanonymizing sensitive information, refusal of disallowed content, irrelevance, or otherwise sensitive output).  \n • If any scanner detects a problematic portion of the output, the system will stop the completion right away. The idea is to cut off any harmful or unwanted responses as soon as they’re detected.\n\nIn the code snippet that follows the explanation, you see two sets of installation commands and module imports:\n\n• First, the instructions to install the LLM Guard package via pip—pointing to the GitHub repository—followed by installing an async package for OpenAI.  \n• Then, various components are imported from modules within the LLM Guard package:\n – From the input scanners, modules such as Anonymize, PromptInjection, TokenLimit, and Toxicity are imported. These are designed to inspect and clean (or flag) the prompt before sending it to the AI model.\n – From the output scanners, modules such as Deanonymize, NoRefusal, Relevance, and Sensitive are imported. These run on the streaming output to ensure that the response stays within acceptable boundaries.\n – The Vault module is imported from llm_guard.vault, which may be used to securely store or retrieve sensitive configuration or credentials.\n\nThe overall goal is to allow both input and output to be validated with minimal added latency. By scanning incoming text and outgoing responses in parallel with the model’s operation (“streaming mode”), the integration is very fast and minimally disruptive. In the case where any content (either prompt or response) is determined to be invalid, the process halts immediately, preventing unsafe or otherwise unacceptable behavior.\n\nThis approach to integrating LLM Guard is useful in scenarios where real-time safety checks are essential—for example, chatbots, content generation systems, or any interactive application that interfaces with a large language model.",

Although your message is labeled “Protocol: error message,” the sample data you provided isn’t an error message output per se—it’s more a description and code snippet showing the intended usage of LLM Guard in a production workflow.\n\nHere’s what the example tells us:\n\n1. During the prompt (input) phase, several scanners run in parallel with the OpenAI API completion. For example:\n • The Anonymize scanner might be checking for personally identifiable information.\n • The PromptInjection scanner examines whether the prompt tries to inject unwanted commands or influences.\n • TokenLimit safeguards against prompts that exceed expected size.\n • Toxicity scans check if the prompt includes harmful language.\n If any of these scanners detect an issue (i.e. “invalid” content), LLM Guard will stop the completion and log the corresponding error.\n\n2. During the output (streaming) phase, additional scanners come into play:\n • Deanonymize might reverse any anonymization applied earlier.\n • NoRefusal verifies that the output isn’t making unauthorized refusals.\n • Relevance ensures that the output stays on-topic.\n • Sensitive checks that nothing sensitive or disallowed is produced.\n If any produced output fails these checks, the ongoing stream is immediately halted.\n\nIn practice, when an “error” is detected by one of these scanners, LLM Guard enforces a safe shutdown of the generation process. The error information (or “protocol error message”) is then logged for further diagnosis or handling. This fast, parallel, and streaming verification approach minimizes disruptions (and importantly, the risk of propagating harmful content) while still giving you real‑time control over both what goes in and what comes out of the model.\n\nIf you’re troubleshooting an error during implementation, here are a few tips:\n\n• Check that all required packages are installed properly (for instance, llm_guard from the provided GitHub link, as well as openai and asyncio).\n• Ensure that your OpenAI API key and environment settings are configured correctly.\n• Look at the log outputs to determine which scanner triggered the error. The logging details should help you identify whether it was a prompt issue (such as prompt injection or excess tokens) or an output safety concern.\n• Verify that you have set up any necessary rules or configurations within LLM Guard if your use case requires custom scanning logic.\n\nIn summary, the “protocol error message” in this context is the mechanism by which LLM Guard stops processing when a violation is detected, ensuring both prompt and streamed output safety. If you have a specific error message or behavior you’d like to address, providing that detail will help narrow down the exact issue.",

You install the necessary packages:\n   • llm_guard (via GitHub link in the example).  \n   • openai and asyncio (commonly used for asynchronous tasks and AI completions).\n\n2. You import Python logging (for logs) and various scanners from LLM Guard:\n   • Input scanners:  \n     – Anonymize: Removes personally identifiable information from the prompt.  \n     – PromptInjection: Detects prompt-injection attempts (e.g., malicious instructions aiming to override system behavior).  \n     – TokenLimit: Ensures the prompt does not exceed token limits.  \n     – Toxicity: Checks for toxic or harmful content.  \n   • Output scanners:  \n     – Deanonymize: Removes any personal data in the generated text.  \n     – NoRefusal: Detects automatic refusal or abrupt halts.  \n     – Relevance: Ensures responses are on-topic.  \n     – Sensitive: Flags sensitive information.  \n\n3.

If any input scanner flags a violation, you can immediately terminate the request.  \n• “We scan the output in streaming mode” means you enable streaming completions from OpenAI (or another LLM service) and pass every chunk of tokens to LLM Guard’s output scanners. If something sensitive or disallowed appears mid-response, you can stop the completion at once.\n\nThis setup ensures minimal latency overhead while still enforcing solid guardrails around LLM usage. If you wish to implement a more production-ready example, you would need to:  \n• Define your scanning logic with the LLM Guard scanners you need.  \n• Handle exceptions or flags raised by these scanners.  \n• Implement your streaming logic for reading OpenAI’s completions in real-time.  \n\nI hope this clarifies how the code snippet and the approach of parallel or streaming-based scanning work together to prevent invalid inputs and outputs.

          "response": "Below is an explanation of the provided pseudo-code example and one way you might implement its idea in Python.\n\n─────────────────────────────  \nOverview\n\nThe pseudo-code demonstrates a workflow for using the LLM Guard library to protect both the input prompt and the generated output during an LLM (for example, OpenAI’s API) interaction. The idea is:\n\n1. Before sending a prompt (task) to your LLM API, run parallel “input scanners” (such as Anonymize, PromptInjection, TokenLimit, Toxicity) on the prompt. If the prompt fails one of these safety checks, the process is immediately aborted and an error is logged.\n\n2. Once the LLM streaming completion starts, the output is scanned in real time using “output scanners” (like Deanonymize, NoRefusal, Relevance, Sensitive). The completion is halted as soon as any problematic content is detected.\n\nThe pseudo-code uses a “while” loop that reads elements (or chunks) from the task and processes (scans) them before finally producing an output result.\n\n─────────────────────────────  \nExample Implementation in Python\n\nBelow is one way to translate the pseudo-code into Python code. In a real-world system you would integrate with OpenAI’s asynchronous API and manage streaming output. For illustration purposes, the following code demonstrates the basic structure:\n\n------------------------------------------------\n#!/usr/bin/env python3\nimport asyncio\nimport logging\n\n# Import scanners from llm_guard.\n# (Note: In your environment, install llm_guard with the given pip install command.)\nfrom llm_guard.input_scanners import Anonymize, PromptInjection, TokenLimit, Toxicity\nfrom llm_guard.output_scanners import Deanonymize, NoRefusal, Relevance, Sensitive\nfrom llm_guard.vault import Vault\n\n# Configure basic logging\nlogging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO)\nlogger = logging.getLogger(__name__)\n\n# Example task (a multi-line string) that will be the prompt.\ntask = \"\"\"In this example, we demonstrate how to use LLM Guard in the fastest and least disruptive way possible.\n\n1. We scan the prompt in parallel with the OpenAI completion. If the prompt is invalid, we stop the completion and log the error.\n2. We scan the output in the streaming mode. We stop the completion as soon as the output is invalid.\n\"\"\"\n\n# Define a function that simulates scanning the input prompt.\ndef scan_prompt(prompt_text: str) -> bool:\n    scanners = [\n        Anonymize(),\n        PromptInjection(),\n        TokenLimit(max_tokens=500),\n        Toxicity()\n    ]\n\n    for scanner in scanners:\n        if not scanner.scan(prompt_text):\n            logger.error(\"Input scanner %s flagged the prompt as invalid.\", scanner.__class__.__name__)\n            return False\n    logger.info(\"All input scanners passed.\")\n    return True\n\n# Define an asynchronous function that simulates the LLM streaming output process.\nasync def stream_output(prompt_text: str):\n    # Here you would use an LLM API that supports streaming. For illustration,\n    # we simulate streaming by yielding parts of a response.\n    simulated_response_chunks = [\n        \"This is the first part of response. \",\n        \"Here comes the second part which is safe. \",\n        \"Finally this is the last part of the generated text.\"\n    ]\n\n    # Create output scanners.\n    output_scanners = [\n        Deanonymize(),\n        NoRefusal(),\n        Relevance(),\n        Sensitive()\n    ]\n\n    for chunk in simulated_response_chunks:\n        # Process each chunk using the output scanners.\n        for scanner in output_scanners:\n            if not scanner.scan(chunk):\n                logger.error(\"Output scanner %s flagged a chunk as invalid. Aborting streaming.\", scanner.__class__.__name__)\n                return  # Abort streaming if a scanner fails.\n        # If all scanners pass, yield the chunk.\n        yield chunk\n        await asyncio.sleep(0.1)  # Simulate a streaming delay.\n\n# Main processing routine\nasync def main():\n    # Step 1: Validate the prompt using input scanners.\n    if not scan_prompt(task):\n        logger.error(\"Prompt did not pass the safety checks. Exiting.\")\n        return\n\n    logger.info(\"Starting LLM generation with streaming output...\")\n    result = \"\"\n\n    # Step 2: Process the streaming output.\n    async for chunk in stream_output(task):\n        logger.info(\"Processed chunk: %s\", chunk)\n        result += chunk\n    \n    logger.info(\"LLM generation complete. Final result:\\n%s\", result)\n\n# Run the async main() function.\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    asyncio.run(main())\n------------------------------------------------\n\n─────────────────────────────  \nExplanation\n\n• The code begins by configuring logging so that errors or warnings from the scanners are recorded.\n\n• The function scan_prompt(prompt_text) loads a set of input scanners (such as Anonymize, PromptInjection, TokenLimit, and Toxicity) and runs them on the prompt. If any scanner fails (returns False) the prompt is considered unsafe and the process terminates.\n\n• The stream_output(prompt_text) asynchronous generator simulates receiving output chunks from an LLM. For each chunk, a series of output scanners (Deanonymize, NoRefusal, Relevance, Sensitive) is applied. If any scanner flags a chunk as problematic, the generator immediately returns (thus aborting the output stream).\n\n• The main() function coordinates the process. It first verifies the prompt, then calls the output streaming generator to produce the final result piece by piece.\n\n─────────────────────────────  \nFinal Notes\n\n• In a production system using an API like OpenAI’s, you would replace the simulated stream_output function with actual API calls that support streaming, checking each chunk as soon as it is received.\n\n• The list and behavior of scanners will depend on your application’s needs and the functionality provided by the llm_guard library.\n\nThis code example mirrors the logic of the pseudo-code provided in your example—reading, processing the task safely, and outputting a result.",

Vault and Secrets:  \n   • Vault securely stores and retrieves secrets (e.g., your OpenAI API key).  \n   • You can substitute your own secret-management solution if preferred.\n\n2. Input Scanning in Parallel:\n   • Because you pass the input scanners to LLMChain, they are simultaneously applied when you call chain.run_streaming.  \n   • If any scanner flags the prompt, LLM Guard will raise an exception and abort.\n\n3. Streaming Output Scanning:\n   • The output_scanners array is checked on every streamed chunk from OpenAI.  \n   • As soon as content violates the policies enforced by your scanners (for example, if the text is “Sensitive” or “Irrelevant”), LLM Guard throws an exception, and you can handle it by logging or other means.\n\n4. Non-Disruptive Workflow:\n   • By running scanners in parallel to the model call, you reduce overhead; if the prompt is valid, you don’t waste time waiting for a “pre-scan” to finish.  \n   • By streaming, you see output as soon as it’s available, and can immediately stop if it becomes invalid.\n\n5. Extensibility:\n   • You can add or remove scanners based on your requirements (e.g., you may not need Anonymize in all scenarios).  \n   • Simply include your custom scanners in the arrays, and LLM Guard will apply them in exactly the same way.\n\nWith this approach, you fulfill the requirement to process requests quickly while respecting content policies. Invalid prompts or completions trigger immediate stops, logging, or other remediation as necessary.",

Objective:\n   • The system shall process requests related to the safe and efficient use of an LLM (Large Language Model) by integrating basic security protocols.\n   • It must ensure that the prompt and the output (completion) are verified in real-time to prevent invalid or malicious content from being processed.\n\n3. Operational Flow:\n   a. Prompt Scanning (Input Phase):\n      • The system scans the incoming prompt in parallel with the OpenAI completion.\n      • If the prompt is found to be invalid (e.g., due to prompt injection, exceeding token limits, containing toxicity, or privacy issues), the system stops the completion immediately.\n      • An error is logged when the prompt violates any of the defined criteria.\n\n   b. Output Scanning (Streaming Phase):\n      • As the output from the completion is generated, it is continuously streamed and scanned.\n      • The system stops the completion as soon as any part of the output is deemed invalid (e.g., not relevant, containing sensitive content, or refusing the expected response).\n\n4. Implementation Components:\n   • The example code demonstrates how to install and import the necessary modules:\n     - Install commands provided via pip for:\n         ▸ LLM Guard (from its GitHub repository)\n         ▸ OpenAI and asyncio.\n     - Input scanners imported:\n         ▸ Anonymize\n         ▸ PromptInjection\n         ▸ TokenLimit\n         ▸ Toxicity\n     - Output scanners imported:\n         ▸ Deanonymize\n         ▸ NoRefusal\n         ▸ Relevance\n         ▸ Sensitive\n     - The Vault utility is also imported to handle secure management of any necessary secrets or credentials.\n\n5. Summary of Code Behavior:\n   • The code sets up a logging mechanism and imports all required modules.\n   • It outlines a secure pipeline where the input is sanitized and verified before proceeding, and the output is continuously validated to avoid propagating errors or harmful content.\n   • This approach minimizes disruption by handling potential issues in real time—stopping the process as soon as an invalid prompt or output is detected while ensuring that all errors are logged.\n\nThis specification establishes a robust and proactive framework for safely integrating LLM completions with real-time scanning mechanisms, ensuring both prompt and output are compliant with security and quality standards.",

If found invalid, you halt the process.\n- **Output scanning**: Streams the output and stops as soon as invalid content is detected.\n\nYou’re interested in how a **search algorithm** would operate in a knowledge database to support this process, particularly with relevance scoring and efficient (logarithmic) complexity.\n\n---\n\n## 2. **Search Algorithm Explanation**\n\n### **Search Space**\n- **Knowledge database**: This is your indexed store of facts, rules, or documents that can be queried to support LLM guard operations (e.g., checking for sensitive content, prompt injection patterns, etc.).\n\n### **Heuristic**\n- **Relevance scoring**: When searching the database (for sensitive terms, PII, etc.), you assign a score to each result based on how relevant it is to the query (e.g., match strength, context).\n\n### **Termination**\n- **Best match found**: The search stops as soon as the most relevant (or first sufficiently relevant) match is found.\n\n### **Complexity**\n- **O(log n) with indexing**: By maintaining indexes (e.g., using trees, inverted indexes), you ensure that each lookup/query in the knowledge database is logarithmic in the number of entries, making the scan fast and scalable.\n\n---\n\n## 3. **How This Applies to the Example Code**\n\nWhen you use scanners like `Anonymize`, `PromptInjection`, `TokenLimit`, `Toxicity`, etc., each checks the input/output against known patterns or entries, often leveraging an internal database or ruleset.\n\n**Example:**\n- The `Sensitive` output scanner might query a list of sensitive terms (knowledge database).\n- When a token/phrase is generated, the scanner does a fast, indexed search to check if it matches any entry.\n- It assigns a relevance score (e.g., exact match = 1.0, partial = 0.7).\n- If a match passes a certain threshold (best match), the output is flagged and streaming stops.\n\n---\n\n## 4. **Algorithm Pseudocode**\n\n```python\ndef scan_content(content, knowledge_db, relevance_threshold):\n    # Assume knowledge_db is indexed for O(log n) lookups\n    for token in stream(content):\n        matches = knowledge_db.search(token)  # log n complexity\n        for match in matches:\n            score = compute_relevance(token, match)\n            if score >= relevance_threshold:\n                return False  # Stop generation, invalid content found\n    return True  # Content is valid\n\n# Usage in streaming output:\nfor chunk in llm_output_stream:\n    if not scan_content(chunk, sensitive_terms_db, 0.8):\n        halt_stream()\n        log_error()\n        break\n```\n\n---\n\n## 5. **Summary Table**\n\n| Step              | Action                          | Complexity | Notes                                                   |\n|-------------------|---------------------------------|------------|---------------------------------------------------------|\n| Scan input        | Parallel with LLM call          | O(log n)   | Fast, non-blocking, halts on invalid prompt             |\n| Scan output       | Streaming, chunk-by-chunk       | O(log n)   | Stops as soon as invalid content is found               |\n| Search mechanism  | Indexed knowledge base search   | O(log n)   | Uses relevance scoring to determine match termination   |\n| Termination       | On best match or invalidation   | –          | Minimizes unnecessary computation                       |\n\n---\n\n## 6. **Key Points**\n\n- **Efficient**: Indexed search ensures minimal latency.\n- **Heuristic**: Relevance scoring allows for smart, context-aware filtering.\n- **Non-disruptive**: Parallel and streaming checks minimize user-visible delays.\n- **Secure**: Immediate termination on detection of undesirable content.\n\n---\n\n**If you need a concrete implementation or want to see how to plug this into your LLM Guard pipeline, let me know!**",

          "response": "Below is a high-level outline of how you might implement a simple search procedure, using a relevance-scoring heuristic and an indexed knowledge database to achieve O(log n) query time once the data is indexed. This sketch focuses on the general logic, so you can adapt it to your frameworks (e.g., Python dictionaries, specialized indexes, or vector databases) and your specific data format.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n1) Prepare and index the data\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n• Collect all documents or knowledge items you want to search over.  \n• Assign each document an identifier (e.g., an integer ID).  \n• Build an index structure that allows for fast lookups. Common approaches:\n  – Inverted index (for keyword-based searching).  \n  – Vector index (for semantic or embedding-based searching).  \n\nIn either approach, the goal is to enable quick narrowing down of candidate matches in O(log n) time once the index is built.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n2) Compute or define relevance scores\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n• If using a keyword-based system:\n  – Split documents (and the query) into tokens (words/phrases).  \n  – Use a metric like TF-IDF or BM25 to compute a relevance score for each candidate document.  \n\n• If using a vector-based (semantic) system:\n  – Convert documents and the query into vectors using an embedding model.  \n  – Index these vectors in a specialized data structure (e.g., a KD-tree, FAISS, or Annoy).  \n  – Compute distances (e.g., cosine similarity) to measure relevance.  \n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n3) Execute the query (O(log n) retrieval)\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n• Given the user’s query string, either:  \n  – Tokenize it (keyword-based).  \n  – Convert to an embedding (semantic-based).  \n\n• Quickly retrieve the top candidate documents using the index. For instance:  \n  – With an inverted index, look up the query tokens, retrieve candidate document IDs, then rank them.  \n  – With a vector index, run a nearest-neighbor search (often approximate) in O(log n) or similar complexity.  \n\n• This yields a set of candidate matches sorted by a relevance score.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n4) Apply stopping criterion: “Best match found” \n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n• Based on your threshold or “best match found” rule, decide how many top-ranked results to return.  \n• If you only need the single best result, you can simply pick the highest-scoring document.  \n• Otherwise, you can retrieve top-K matches above a minimum relevance threshold.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n5) Integrate with your application\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n• Once the best match or matches are found, you can deliver them to the user or feed them into the next processing stage.  \n• In your LLM Guard example, you can pass the top match to be used in crafting or validating a prompt.  \n• If you wish to run these steps in streaming or parallel modes (similar to how you described scanning the prompt/output simultaneously), you can adapt the indexing and search logic to run asynchronously or in separate threads.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nExample Pseudocode (Keyword-based, TF-IDF)\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n1. documents = [...]  # Your knowledge base\n2. index = build_inverted_index(documents)  \n3. tfidf_model = build_tfidf(documents, index)  \n\ndef search(query: str, index, tfidf_model, top_k=1):\n    # Tokenize query\n    query_tokens = tokenize(query)\n    \n    # Retrieve candidate docs from inverted index\n    candidate_docs = retrieve_candidates(query_tokens, index)\n    \n    # Score each candidate with TF-IDF\n    scores = []\n    for doc_id in candidate_docs:\n        score = tfidf_score(query_tokens, doc_id, tfidf_model)\n        scores.append((doc_id, score))\n    \n    # Sort by descending score\n    scores.sort(key=lambda x: x[1], reverse=True)\n    \n    # Return top_k results (or just the best match if top_k=1)\n    return scores[:top_k]\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nKey Points\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n• Building the index is usually more expensive but is done once (offline or asynchronously).  \n• Once the index is built, searches can be done in O(log n) (or similar) depending on your data structure and retrieval approach.  \n• Relevance scoring is where you can customize for your domain—keyword-based, semantic embeddings, or hybrids.  \n• Integrate the search results into your LLM workflow (e.g., with LLM Guard) by scanning the retrieved text for policy compliance or by using it as context for your completion prompt.\n\nThis framework should help you implement an efficient knowledge lookup that returns the best match for a query, aligning with your outline (“Search Space: Knowledge database, Heuristic: Relevance scoring, Termination: Best match found, Complexity: O(log n) with indexing”).",

          "response": "Below is an explanation of the search (or verification) algorithm showcased in the code sample:\n\n1. Purpose and Approach:\n • The code demonstrates how to use LLM Guard, a tool that protects language model completions by scanning both the prompt and the output. The goal is to enforce safety policies (for example, masking sensitive data or preventing prompt injections) in a fast, minimally disruptive way.\n • The algorithm employs a dual-phase scanning process:\n  – Input scanning: It is performed in parallel with initiating the OpenAI completion.\n  – Output scanning: It is done in streaming mode as tokens are generated.\n\n2. Input Scanning:\n • Several input scanners are applied, for example:\n  – Anonymize: Likely masks or removes identifying details.\n  – PromptInjection: Checks for hacks or malicious modifications in the prompt.\n  – TokenLimit: Ensures that the prompt stays within acceptable token limits.\n  – Toxicity: Identifies content that might be offensive or otherwise unsafe.\n • The scan is performed immediately while the specification of the prompt is processed. If even one scanner detects an issue (for example, an invalid or unsafe prompt), the completion process is halted and an error is logged. This “fail fast” method is efficient and prevents unnecessary model calls.\n\n3. Output Scanning:\n • As the language model produces output, a set of output scanners are engaged in real-time:\n  – Deanonymize: Likely reverses prior anonymization if needed (or checks that de-anonymization only happens when safe).\n  – NoRefusal: Possibly checks that the LLM isn’t refusing valid requests.\n  – Relevance: Ensures that generated information is pertinent to the user query.\n  – Sensitive: Checks for sensitive or disallowed content in the output.\n • The completion stream is continuously monitored. If an unacceptable output is detected at any point, the generation is stopped immediately. This ensures that no harmful or off-policy output reaches the user.\n\n4. Search Algorithm Characteristics:\n • Search Space: \n  – The “knowledge database” mentioned likely refers to the internal repository of safe-guards, patterns, rules, or previously encountered unsafe outputs/prompts.\n • Heuristic – Relevance Scoring:\n  – The system uses a relevance scoring heuristic to determine whether the scanned content (either for prompt or produced output) fits within the safe guidelines. It prioritizes actions based on how closely the content matches risky patterns.\n • Termination – Best Match Found:\n  – The scanning process is designed to conclude as soon as it confidently identifies a violation. In other words, if a prompt or output token triggers a high-risk score, the process terminates (either aborting the prompt processing or the streaming of unsafe text).\n • Complexity – O(log n) with Indexing:\n  – The mention of O(log n) implies that the system uses an indexed search (perhaps a tree or a hash-indexed structure) in its knowledge base that checks for known vulnerabilities or patterns. This ensures that the scanning operations are efficient and scale well even as the set of patterns or rules grows.\n\n5. Overall System Operation:\n • In essence, the algorithm efficiently scans both the input and output, using indexed lookups against its internal database of rules and sensitivities. The relevance scoring heuristic helps determine if the text is acceptable, and the process halts as soon as a problematic instance (i.e., the “best match” with a known rule violation) is found.\n • By indexing the knowledge database, the algorithm ensures rapid lookups (O(log n) performance), which is critical in a real-time system where delays can disrupt the smooth operation of language model completions.\n\nThis design shows a careful balance between speed and safety, ensuring that the user interaction remains fluid while still respecting the necessary safeguards and content standards.",

The complexity of this indexing step is typically O(log n), where n is the size of the knowledge database or corpus used by the language model.\n\n**Scanning Complexity**: The scanning of the input prompt and output in parallel and streaming mode, respectively, can be considered constant-time operations, O(1), as they are performed on the fly without the need for extensive searching or processing.\n\nOverall, the complexity of this search algorithm is dominated by the indexing step, which is O(log n), making it an efficient and scalable approach for working with language models in a safe and reliable manner.",

If you want to use this configuration effectively, here are some considerations and suggestions:\n\n### Issues and Recommendations\n\n1. **Improper Code Embedding**:  \n   The Python code in the value attribute is inside triple quotes (\"\"\"), but XML attribute values cannot contain unescaped line breaks or triple quotes. This will likely cause XML parsing errors.\n\n2. **Best Practice**:  \n   If you need to store large code samples or multiline scripts in XML, it’s better to use a CDATA section or an external file reference.\n\n---\n\n### How to Fix\n\n#### **Option 1: Use CDATA Section**\nIf your XML parser supports it, use CDATA to store raw text:\n\n```xml\n<setting key=\"request_handler\">\n<![CDATA[\n# pip install llm_guard@git+https://github.com/protectai/llm-guard.git\n# pip install openai asyncio\n\nimport logging\n\nfrom llm_guard.input_scanners import Anonymize, PromptInjection, TokenLimit, Toxicity\nfrom llm_guard.output_scanners import Deanonymize, NoRefusal, Relevance, Sensitive\nfrom llm_guard.vault import Vault\n\n# ... rest of your code ...\n]]>\n</setting>\n```\n\n#### **Option 2: Reference an External File**\nStore your code in a separate `.py` file and reference it:\n\n```xml\n<setting key=\"request_handler_file\" value=\"scripts/request_handler.py\"/>\n```\n\n---\n\n### General Advice\n\n- If you intend to extract and execute this code from XML, ensure your application reads the CDATA or external file and writes it as a Python file before execution.\n- Make sure your XML parser and handling logic can deal with large text blocks and special characters safely.\n\n---\n\n### Example (Shortened Code in CDATA)\n\n```xml\n<?xml version=\"1.0\"?>\n<configuration>\n  <setting key=\"request_handler\">\n    <![CDATA[\n# pip install llm_guard@git+https://github.com/protectai/llm-guard.git\n# pip install openai asyncio\n\nimport logging\nfrom llm_guard.input_scanners import Anonymize\n# ... rest of code ...\n    ]]>\n  </setting>\n  <setting key=\"enabled\" value=\"true\"/>\n</configuration>\n```\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \n- Don't embed unescaped multiline Python code in XML attributes.\n- Use CDATA or an external file reference for better maintainability and compatibility.\n\nIf you have a specific question about the code or the configuration, please let me know!",

This snippet demonstrates how to install and use LLM Guard alongside OpenAI’s Python library and asyncio, as well as how to use various input and output scanners.\n\nIf you’re looking for more information about how to use or integrate this configuration, here are a few points to consider:\n\n1. Location of the XML File:\n   – You’ll need to place this XML file somewhere your application can read it (e.g., as part of your application’s configuration).\n   – Make sure that the parser or configuration manager you’re using correctly reads multi-line values.\n\n2. Using the Python Code:\n   – The snippet includes pip install commands for llm_guard (from the GitHub URL) and openai, asyncio.\n   – After you install these libraries, you can import them in your Python code (e.g., import logging, import llm_guard, etc.) just like in the snippet.\n\n3. Parallel and Streaming Scans:\n   – Based on the snippet’s comments, LLM Guard can scan the user’s prompt in parallel to an OpenAI request, and also stream-scan the model’s response. If it detects a violation (such as toxicity, prompt injection, or sensitive content), LLM Guard can stop the response immediately.\n\n4. Why This Is Useful:\n   – By scanning prompts and outputs, you reduce the risk that your application will produce or accept harmful, inappropriate, or disallowed content. \n   – The input_scanners (Anonymize, PromptInjection, TokenLimit, Toxicity) evaluate incoming requests, while the output_scanners (Deanonymize, NoRefusal, Relevance, Sensitive) evaluate the generated content that’s returned by the LLM.\n\n5. Enabling or Disabling:\n   – The configuration has a “setting” with key=\"enabled\" and value=\"true\", which presumably turns on this request handler. If you need to disable it, you can change this value to “false”, or manage it within your application logic.\n\n6. Security Best Practices:\n   – Always keep your API keys secure; consider integrating them into a vault mechanism (e.g., from llm_guard.vault import Vault).\n   – Be mindful of how you log sensitive data. Leaking logs could expose either your prompts or personal information.\n\n7. Next Steps:\n   – If you’re using a framework (like Flask, FastAPI, or similar) to serve requests, integrate this request handler in your endpoint logic or middlewares.\n   – Adjust the input and output scanners according to your policy or compliance requirements. For instance, if you prefer not to check for toxicity, you can omit that scanner.\n\nIf you need help with a specific step—such as parsing this XML in a particular language, integrating it into your existing code, or customizing the scanners—let me know, and I’ll be glad to provide more targeted guidance.",

          "response": "This example appears to show a sample configuration (using XML) that sets up a request handler for LLM Guard. LLM Guard is a tool designed to help secure interactions with language models by scanning both the input (prompt) and the output (completion) for issues like prompt injections, toxicity, sensitive content, and other unwanted patterns. Here’s a breakdown of the significant parts of the code and what they mean:\n\n1. XML Configuration Structure:\n  • The configuration is structured in XML format with multiple <setting> elements.\n  • One setting has a key \"request_handler\" and its value contains a code snippet (or description) that explains how the LLM Guard works.  \n  • Another setting, \"enabled\", is set to \"true\", which likely means the protection or these checks are enabled when this configuration is loaded.\n\n2. Explanation Embedded in the Request Handler Setting:\n  • The text explains that:\n   – The prompt is scanned in parallel with the OpenAI completion. If an invalid prompt is detected (such as text that might lead to harmful behavior), the process is immediately halted and the error is logged.\n   – The output is also scanned in a streaming mode so that as the output is produced, it’s checked in real time. If any problems are found, the output generation is stopped immediately.\n  • This approach aims to secure the interaction with the language model in both directions (input and output).\n\n3. Python Code and Dependencies:\n  • The code snippet includes installation instructions using pip. Specifically:\n   – Installing LLM Guard from its repository.\n   – Installing OpenAI and asyncio if they aren’t already installed.\n  • The Python code then imports several modules from the llm_guard package:\n   – From input_scanners: modules like Anonymize, PromptInjection, TokenLimit, and Toxicity are imported. These likely serve to pre-screen the prompt text to ensure it is safe and adheres to any necessary limits or guidelines.\n   – From output_scanners: modules like Deanonymize, NoRefusal, Relevance, and Sensitive are imported. These are used to analyze the generated output in real time to catch and block undesired content.\n   – Vault is imported from llm_guard.vault, which might handle secret management or secure storage of configuration details such as API keys.\n\n4. Implementation Considerations:\n  • The configuration value for request_handler is given as a multiline string. If this XML were to be parsed by an XML parser, you’d need to ensure that any multiline text is correctly encapsulated (for example, using a CDATA section or properly escaped quotes).\n  • The embedded comments (with # pip install …) and Python code suggest that this configuration file might be used in a system where the XML configuration is paired with executable Python code to initialize the LLM Guard service.\n\nSummary:\nThe provided XML snippet, along with the embedded Python code, illustrates how to integrate LLM Guard into your language model pipeline. With parallel prompt validation and streaming output validation, LLM Guard aims to provide a fast, robust, and non-disruptive way of ensuring safe interactions with language models by intercepting problematic content as early as possible in both the input and output stages.\n\nIf you plan to use this configuration, be sure to verify that your XML structure is valid (especially concerning multiline text values) and that the configuration meets the technical expectations of your application’s configuration loader.",

Install dependencies:\n```bash\npip install llm_guard@git+https://github.com/protectai/llm-guard.git\npip install openai asyncio\n```\n\n2. Complete the script:\nYou’ve pasted imports and a description, but not the full code.

          "response": "Below is a quick walkthrough of how you can use LLM Guard with OpenAI in a way that is least disruptive to your existing code while still providing safety checks for both prompts (inputs) and generated outputs:\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n1. Installing Dependencies\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n• LLM Guard (directly from GitHub):  \n  pip install llm_guard@git+https://github.com/protectai/llm-guard.git\n\n• Other requirements:  \n  pip install openai asyncio\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n2. Input Scanning with LLM Guard\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nYou can attach multiple input scanners (e.g., PromptInjection, Anonymize, TokenLimit, Toxicity) to catch different categories of invalid prompts before the request ever reaches the LLM:\n\nfrom llm_guard.input_scanners import Anonymize, PromptInjection, TokenLimit, Toxicity\n\n# Example of scanning logic (simplified)\ninput_scanners = [\n    PromptInjection(),\n    Anonymize(),\n    TokenLimit(max_tokens=2048),\n    Toxicity()\n]\n\n# You would then pass the user prompt to these scanners\n# before sending it to the OpenAI API.\ndef validate_input(prompt: str) -> bool:\n    for scanner in input_scanners:\n        if not scanner.scan(prompt):\n            logging.error(f\"Prompt failed validation: {scanner.__class__.__name__}\")\n            return False\n    return True\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n3. Output Scanning in Streaming Mode\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nWhen you stream the response from the OpenAI API, you can scan each chunk of the output as it is generated. If a scanner flags any chunk, you can immediately stop the streaming:\n\nfrom llm_guard.output_scanners import Deanonymize, NoRefusal, Relevance, Sensitive\n\noutput_scanners = [\n    Deanonymize(),\n    NoRefusal(),\n    Relevance(),\n    Sensitive()\n]\n\nasync def handle_output_stream(response_generator):\n    async for chunk in response_generator:\n        text_chunk = chunk[\"choices\"][0][\"text\"]\n        \n        # Pass the chunk text through each output scanner\n        for scanner in output_scanners:\n            if not scanner.scan(text_chunk):\n                logging.error(f\"Output failed validation: {scanner.__class__.__name__}\")\n                # Stop the stream or handle the invalid output\n                return\n        yield text_chunk\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n4. Putting It All Together\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nBelow is a simplified example incorporating both input and output filtering:\n\nimport openai\nimport asyncio\n\nasync def run_safe_query(prompt: str):\n    # 1. Validate user prompt\n    if not validate_input(prompt):\n        logging.error(\"Prompt is invalid. Halting request.\")\n        return\n    \n    # 2. Launch the OpenAI API call in streaming mode\n    try:\n        response = await openai.Completion.acreate(\n            engine=\"text-davinci-003\",\n            prompt=prompt,\n            max_tokens=100,\n            stream=True\n        )\n        \n        # 3. Scan and yield output chunks\n        async for chunk in handle_output_stream(response):\n            # This is where you'd handle or display the valid chunk\n            print(chunk, end=\"\")\n    \n    except Exception as e:\n        logging.error(f\"OpenAI API call encountered an error: {str(e)}\")\n\n# Example usage:\n# asyncio.run(run_safe_query(\"Your user prompt goes here\"))\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n5. Important Notes\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n• Parallel Scanning of the Prompt: Depending on your system design, you can validate the prompt asynchronously in parallel with sending the initial request to OpenAI. However, you must stop the request if the validation eventually fails.  \n• Immediate Stopping on Invalid Output: Since you’re streaming the response, you can cut off the response the moment you detect something out-of-bounds.  \n• Scanner Configuration: The above scanners (PromptInjection, Toxicity, etc.) are examples. LLM Guard supports multiple scanners, each of which you can configure or extend.  \n\nThis setup ensures that your application handles both potentially harmful user inputs and potentially risky model outputs in real time, without introducing excessive latency or complexity.",

The process involves scanning both the input prompt and the output completion in real time, allowing us to stop processing as soon as an invalid pattern is detected (e.g., prompt injection, invalid tokens, toxicity, etc.).\n\n## Overview\n\nThe approach used here is:\n1. Validate the input.\n2. Execute the processing.\n3. Return the result.\n\nFor input validation, we check the prompt in parallel with the OpenAI completion. If the input fails validation (for example due to prompt injection issues), the completion is stopped and an error is logged immediately.\n\nFor output validation, the output is scanned in streaming mode. This means the completion is stopped as soon as any aberrant or unexpected behavior is detected.\n\n## Installation\n\nBefore running the project, install the required packages. You can install LLM Guard from the GitHub repository and other dependencies using pip:\n\n```bash\npip install llm_guard@git+https://github.com/protectai/llm-guard.git\npip install openai asyncio\n```\n\n## Usage Example\n\nBelow is an example demonstrating how to use LLM Guard to process a request:\n\n```bash\n./processor \"\"\"\nIn this example, we demonstrate how to use LLM Guard in the fastest and least disruptive way possible.\n\n1.

The workflow involves three key steps:\n\n1. **Validate input**  \n2. **Execute processing**  \n3. **Return result**\n\n---\n\n## Step-by-Step Approach\n\n### 1. Validate Input\n\n- Use input scanners provided by `llm_guard` to ensure the input prompt is valid and safe.\n- Recommended scanners:\n  - **Anonymize**: Removes personally identifiable information from the input.\n  - **PromptInjection**: Detects malicious prompt injections.\n  - **TokenLimit**: Ensures the input prompt is within acceptable token limits.\n  - **Toxicity**: Checks for toxic or harmful content.\n\n### 2. Execute Processing\n\n- After validation, forward the prompt to the OpenAI API to obtain a completion.\n- Run the validated prompt and API call in parallel using `asyncio` to ensure minimal latency and disruption.\n- Continuously scan the output from OpenAI in streaming mode using the recommended output scanners:\n  - **Deanonymize**: Detects attempts to reveal anonymized or sensitive information.\n  - **NoRefusal**: Ensures the model does not refuse to answer legitimate questions unnecessarily.\n  - **Relevance**: Checks if the output remains relevant to the input prompt.\n  - **Sensitive**: Detects sensitive or inappropriate content.\n\n- Immediately stop the OpenAI completion if output scanning identifies invalid or sensitive content.\n\n### 3. Return Result\n\n- Return the validated and scanned output to the user.\n- Log any errors or invalid content detected during the scanning process for auditing purposes.\n\n---\n\n## Installation\n\nInstall required libraries:\n\n```bash\npip install llm_guard@git+https://github.com/protectai/llm-guard.git\npip install openai asyncio\n```\n\n---\n\n## Example Usage\n\nProcess input using the described approach:\n\n```bash\n./processor \"\"\"\"\nIn this example, we demonstrate how to use LLM Guard in the fastest and least disruptive way possible.\n\n1.

Validate Input\n```python\n# Configure input scanners\ninput_scanners = [\n    Anonymize(),\n    PromptInjection(),\n    TokenLimit(),\n    Toxicity()\n]\n\n# Validate prompt in parallel with LLM processing\nsanitized_prompt, is_valid = scan_prompt(prompt, input_scanners)\n```\n\n### 2. Execute Processing\n```python\n# Process with OpenAI while scanning continues\nif is_valid:\n    response_stream = openai.chat.completions.create(\n        model=\"gpt-3.5-turbo\",\n        messages=[{\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": sanitized_prompt}],\n        stream=True\n    )\n```\n\n### 3. Return Result\n```python\n# Stream output scanning\noutput_scanners = [\n    Deanonymize(),\n    NoRefusal(),\n    Relevance(),\n    Sensitive()\n]\n\n# Validate response chunks in real-time\nvalidated_response = stream_and_validate(response_stream, output_scanners)\n```\n\n## Key Benefits\n\n- **Parallel Processing**: Input validation runs concurrently with LLM processing\n- **Early Termination**: Invalid prompts stop completion immediately\n- **Streaming Validation**: Output scanning occurs in real-time during response generation\n- **Minimal Latency**: Fastest possible security implementation\n- **Comprehensive Coverage**: Both input and output protection\n\n## Usage Example\n\n```bash\n./processor \"Your prompt here\"\n```\n\nThe processor will:\n1. Scan the input prompt for security issues\n2. Anonymize sensitive data if present\n3. Send sanitized prompt to OpenAI\n4. Validate streaming response in real-time\n5. Return secure, deanonymized output\n\n## Error Handling\n\n- Invalid prompts are logged and processing stops immediately\n- Output validation failures terminate streaming responses\n- All security events are logged for monitoring and analysis\n\nThis implementation provides the fastest and least disruptive way to integrate LLM Guard while maintaining comprehensive security coverage.",

GraphQL Schema Explanation\n\n```graphql\ntype Mutation {\n  processRequest(input: String!): ProcessingResult\n}\n\ntype ProcessingResult {\n  success: Boolean!\n  message: String\n}\n```\n\n**What it does:**\n- Defines a mutation operation called `processRequest` that takes a required string input.\n- Returns a `ProcessingResult`, which reports if the processing was successful and includes an optional message.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Python Code Context\n\nYour code snippet demonstrates how to integrate [LLM Guard](https://github.com/protectai/llm-guard) into a workflow, typically for safeguarding LLM (Large Language Model) prompts and completions.\n\nKey points:\n\n- **Input Scanners**: `Anonymize`, `PromptInjection`, `TokenLimit`, `Toxicity`\n- **Output Scanners**: `Deanonymize`, `NoRefusal`, `Relevance`, `Sensitive`\n- **Vault**: Used for securely handling sensitive data\n- **Parallel Prompt Scanning**: Prompt is checked while sending to OpenAI; output is streamed and checked in real time\n\n---\n\n## 3. Recommendations & Corrections\n\n### a. Schema Correction\n\nYour input block in the schema is a comment string, not valid GraphQL syntax. The schema itself is fine.\n\n### b. Python Imports\n\nThe last line of your Python snippet:\n```python\nfrom llm_guard.vault import Vault\"\n```\nhas an extra quote at the end. Remove it.\n\n### c. Example Integration\n\nHere’s a minimal, conceptual way your `processRequest` could be implemented in Python (not full code, just a structural guide):\n\n```python\nimport asyncio\nfrom llm_guard.input_scanners import PromptInjection, Toxicity\nfrom llm_guard.output_scanners import Sensitive\nfrom openai import AsyncOpenAI\n\nasync def process_request(input_text: str):\n    # Scan input\n    if PromptInjection().scan(input_text)[1] or Toxicity().scan(input_text)[1]:\n        return {\"success\": False, \"message\": \"Invalid or toxic prompt.\"}\n\n    # Send to OpenAI in streaming mode, scan output\n    client = AsyncOpenAI()\n    stream = await client.completions.create(\n        model=\"gpt-3.5-turbo\",\n        prompt=input_text,\n        stream=True\n    )\n    async for chunk in stream:\n        if Sensitive().scan(chunk.text)[1]:\n            return {\"success\": False, \"message\": \"Sensitive info detected in output.\"}\n    return {\"success\": True, \"message\": \"Processed successfully.\"}\n```\n\nYou would then expose this function via your GraphQL mutation resolver in your server framework (e.g., Ariadne, Strawberry, Graphene).\n\n---\n\n## 4. Summary\n\n- Your GraphQL schema is valid for the outlined use case.\n- The Python snippet shows how to integrate LLM Guard for scanning both input and output of LLM calls.\n- Watch out for syntax errors (like the stray quote).\n- Make sure to connect your mutation to backend logic that actually invokes these scanners.\n\n---\n\n**If you’d like a full, end-to-end example (GraphQL resolver + Python LLM Guard integration), let me know!**",

In the processRequest mutation step:  \n   1) We first scan the user input (in parallel or sequentially, depending on your pipeline setup).  \n   2) If the input is invalid or flagged, the scanning logic will raise an exception, which we catch and return to the user as an error.   \n   3) If the input is valid, we call the OpenAI completion endpoint with the sanitized or verified prompt.  \n   4) Once we get the completion, we run output scanners to check or transform the text from the model if needed.  \n   5) If the output scans pass, we return a success with the final text. If not, we log or raise an error.  \n\nThe above flow demonstrates a clean way to intercept data both inbound and outbound to ensure you meet your safety, compliance, or business requirements.  \n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n6. Next Steps\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n• Customize the scanners: If you find certain scanners unnecessary (e.g., you do not need an “Anonymize” scanner), you can remove them from the pipeline.  \n• Add or build your own custom scanners: If you have domain-specific rules, you can write custom scanner classes that inherit from BaseScanner.  \n• Adjust concurrency: If certain input checks must happen after others (e.g., you need to remove PII before you measure toxicity so that PII doesn’t influence the classification), use sequential scanning.  \n• Integrate with a real server: Instead of the simple if __name__ == \"__main__\": snippet above, integrate this schema with a production GraphQL server (e.g., running via an ASGI or WSGI framework).  \n\nWith that, you have a complete illustration of how to weave LLM Guard’s scanning mechanism into a minimal GraphQL API.",

          "response": "This schema defines a GraphQL mutation called processRequest along with its associated types. Here’s a breakdown of what’s going on:\n\n1. Mutation Definition:\n  • The mutation processRequest accepts one argument: input, which is a non-null String.\n  • When this mutation is called, it returns an object of type ProcessingResult.\n\n2. ProcessingResult Type:\n  • This type includes two fields:\n    – success (Boolean!): Indicates whether the processing was successful.\n    – message (String): Provides additional information or context about the processing result.\n\n3. The Example Input (Documentation Comment):\n  • The long multiline string, provided just after the input definition, is a documentation string (or docstring) that explains a sample usage scenario:\n    – It demonstrates how to incorporate LLM Guard in a “fast and least disruptive” manner.\n    – The approach involves scanning the prompt (input) concurrently with the OpenAI completion. If the prompt is flagged as invalid (e.g., due to prompt injection or toxicity), the process stops and an error is logged.\n    – It also illustrates that the output is scanned in a streaming fashion: if any part of the output fails the checks (e.g., sensitivity, deanonymization), the streaming is halted.\n\n4. Python Code Snippet Details:\n  • The snippet imports various modules from the llm_guard package, which is used for ensuring safe usage of language models.\n  • Input scanners such as Anonymize, PromptInjection, TokenLimit, and Toxicity are used to analyze and (if necessary) sanitize or block the provided prompt.\n  • Output scanners like Deanonymize, NoRefusal, Relevance, and Sensitive serve to check the model’s output as it is generated, providing a safeguard to automatically stop potentially harmful completions.\n  • Finally, the snippet mentions that necessary dependencies can be installed with pip from the provided GitHub repository and that asyncio (alongside OpenAI) is used, likely to facilitate asynchronous processing of the parallel input and output scans.\n\nOverall, the provided GraphQL schema and accompanying Python example illustrate how one might expose a safe language-model processing endpoint via a GraphQL API. The processRequest mutation uses LLM Guard to ensure that, by scanning both the input and the output, prompt injections or other problematic content can be detected and handled in real time before further processing or delivery occurs.",

It also expects specific whitespace and punctuation between words.\n\n- Each letter in every word is wrapped in a character class, like `[iI][nN]` for \"in\", to allow both lowercase and uppercase.\n- Spaces between words are matched with `\\s+` (one or more whitespace).\n- Punctuation (like commas, periods, colons, slashes) is matched literally (e.g., `\\,`, `\\.`).\n- The pattern is extremely rigid in terms of expected structure, order, and content.\n\n## 2. **What Does It Match?**\n\n### **The pattern matches the following (case-insensitive):**\n- **A multi-line, formatted code example and comment block** explaining how to use `llm_guard` with OpenAI completions, including numbered steps, install commands, and import statements.\n- The match begins with a comment or string literal explaining the demonstration purpose.\n- It then expects two enumerated steps (1. and 2.) each with a precise explanation.\n- Then, it expects two pip install commands (for `llm_guard` and `openai_asyncio`).\n- Then, it expects several Python import statements from the `llm_guard` library, listing specific functions and classes.\n- Finally, it expects a description line: `Description: Matches text related to request processing`\n- And a line with `Flags: gi (global, case-insensitive)`\n\n**In short:**  \nIt matches an example/tutorial block (including code and comments) for using `llm_guard` with OpenAI, as written in the exact order and format, but allowing any mix of upper/lowercase.\n\n## 3. **Practical Example**\n\n### **Here is a simplified illustration of the kind of text this would match:**\n\n```\nIn this example, we demonstrate how to use llm guard in the fastest and least disruptive way possible.\n1.

          "response": "Below is an explanation of the regular expression you posted.\n\n1. Overall Structure:\n • The regex is written as a single (multi‐line) pattern that is meant to match several blocks of literal text. Each block is built from individual character classes that match specific letters in a case‐insensitive way (for example, [iI] matches “i” or “I”). Although the global (g) and case‐insensitive (i) flags are set, the individual character classes (e.g. [nN] instead of just “n”) make the case‐insensitivity redundant. In short, the regex forces an exact match (including punctuation and whitespace) of several phrases.\n\n2. First Block:\n • It starts with a pattern that matches a phrase like:\n   \"in this example, we demonstrate how to use llm guard in the fastest and least disruptive way possible.\"\n • Every word:\n  – Has each letter matched by a character class ([iI] for “i”, [nN] for “n”, etc.)\n  – Uses \\s+ between words to match one or more whitespace characters.\n  – Uses punctuation such as commas (\\,) or periods (\\.) exactly where shown.\n • The pattern is written in a very detailed way, ensuring that every letter is exactly in the intended order, regardless of case (even though the i flag would have achieved that if used with plain letters).\n\n3. Second Block:\n • After the first phrase, the regex seems to include additional numbered sections.\n • For example, the next section begins with:\n   [11]\\.\\s+[wW][eE]\\s+[sS][cC][aA][nN] ...\n • This block matches text starting with “11.” followed by a sentence about scanning the prompt in parallel with the openai completion. It also describes what happens if the prompt is invalid, ending with logging an error.\n • The next similar block (starting with [22]\\.) is a corresponding section for output scanning in “streaming mode” that stops the completion if the output is invalid.\n\n4. Comments/Installation and Import Sections:\n • After these three blocks, there are commented lines (each starting with #) that look like installation instructions. For example:\n   # [pP][iI][pP] ... pip install llm_guard@git+https://github.com/...\n • Following these are additional sections that begin with simple regex parts (again written as character classes for each letter) matching Python import statements:\n  – An “import logging” line.\n  – Imports from llm_guard.input_scanners, with functions like anonymize, promptinjection (note the letter‐by‐letter matching), tokenlimit, and toxicicity.\n  – Imports from llm_guard.output_scanners such as deanonimize, norefusal, relevance, sensitive.\n  – And finally an import from llm_guard.vault for vault.\n • These sections are meant to match (or highlight) text related to request processing, including installation instructions and the code that sets up input/output scanning.\n\n5. What It Matches:\n • The regex will match a fixed text that includes a very specific “in this example” sentence, two numbered paragraphs with line numbers [11]. and [22]. that describe request scanning behaviors, and additional commented/instructional and import code lines.\n • The intended use seems to be checking that some documentation or log output exactly conforms to this expected text regarding request processing methodology.\n\n6. Special Notes:\n • Using explicit character classes for each letter (e.g. [iI] instead of relying on the i flag) is repetitive when the overall case‐insensitive flag (i) is already specified.\n • The pattern enforces exact spacing and punctuation (using \\s+ for whitespace and escaped punctuation) so any deviation will cause a mismatch.\n • The overall design appears to be a validation or search pattern to confirm that the text (or log) includes well‐defined messages regarding prompt and output scanning, installation commands, and import statements.\n\nIn summary, the pattern is carefully constructed to match a very specific set of text blocks that document aspects of request processing in a system (likely one that deals with machine learning model safety and output filtering). The use of detailed character classes, strict whitespace, and punctuation matching ensures that the text conforms exactly to what is expected.\n\nThis explanation should help clarify what the regex is designed to do. Let me know if you need further details on any specific part!",

          "response": "Here's the given regular expression pattern simplified and explained clearly. The provided regex is a highly verbose, case-insensitive pattern explicitly enumerating each character in multiple words. In practice, you could represent it more concisely by using the case-insensitive flag and simple word matching.\n\nBelow is a clear breakdown of the functionality, intention, and simplified form of the provided regex:\n\n### Original intent of the regex:\nThe given regular expression matches text that describes a specific example of how to use \"llm guard,\" including the installation of dependencies via pip, imports from modules (`llm_guard.*`), and logging setup. Specifically, it matches text related to:\n\n1. An explanatory example sentence on using `llm guard` in the fastest and least disruptive way.\n2. Instructions (marked by `[11]`, `[22]`) for scanning the prompt and output in parallel, stopping completions early if invalid, and logging errors.\n3. Pip installation instructions from GitHub (`llm_guard`) and from PyPI (`openai`, `asyncio`).\n4. Python imports from various `llm_guard` submodules (input scanners, output scanners, vault, etc.) and the logging module.\n\n### Simplified Explanation of Original Regex:\n- The pattern explicitly lists each character with optional whitespace (`\\s+`) between words.\n- It handles multiple sections: an introductory sentence, numbered steps `[11]` and `[22]`, pip installation commands, and Python import statements.\n- The original regex redundantly specifies every character twice (upper-case and lower-case), which can be simplified by using the `i` (case-insensitive) regex flag.\n\n### Simplified and Readable Regular Expression:\nInstead of explicitly enumerating each character, you can simplify the regex significantly using the `i` (case-insensitive) flag. Here is how the simplified version looks:\n\n```regex\n(?is)                                                  # Case-insensitive and dot matches newline\nIn\\s+this\\s+example,\\s+we\\s+demonstrate\\s+how\\s+to\\s+use\\s+llm\\s+guard\\s+in\\s+the\\s+fastest\\s+and\\s+least\\s+disruptive\\s+way\\s+possible\\.\\s*\n\\[11\\]\\.\\s+We\\s+scan\\s+the\\s+prompt\\s+in\\s+parallel\\s+with\\s+the\\s+OpenAI\\s+completion\\.\\s+If\\s+the\\s+prompt\\s+is\\s+invalid,\\s+we\\s+stop\\s+the\\s+completion\\s+and\\s+log\\s+the\\s+error\\.\\s*\n\\[22\\]\\.\\s+We\\s+scan\\s+the\\s+output\\s+in\\s+the\\s+streaming\\s+mode\\.\\s+We\\s+stop\\s+the\\s+completion\\s+as\\s+soon\\s+as\\s+the\\s+output\\s+is\\s+invalid\\.\\s*\n#\\s+pip\\s+install\\s+llm_guard@git\\+https://github\\.com/protectai/llm-guard\\.git\\s*\n#\\s+pip\\s+install\\s+openai\\s+asyncio\\s*\nimport\\s+logging\\s*\nfrom\\s+llm_guard\\.input_scanners\\s+import\\s+anonymize,\\s+promptinjection,\\s+tokenlimit,\\s+toxicity\\s*\nfrom\\s+llm_guard\\.output_scanners\\s+import\\s+deanonymize,\\s+norefusal,\\s+relevance,\\s+sensitive\\s*\nfrom\\s+llm_guard\\.vault\\s+import\\s+vault\n```\n\n### Explanation of Simplified Regex:\n- `(?is)` enables:\n  - `i`: Case-insensitive matching (no need to explicitly match uppercase and lowercase variants)\n  - `s`: Dot matches newline, allowing multiline matching clearly.\n- The simplified regex directly expresses the intended phrases clearly, without character-by-character enumeration.\n- Special characters like `.`, `[`, `]`, and URLs are properly escaped (`\\.` to match literal periods).\n- Whitespace (`\\s+`) matches one or more whitespace characters between words or phrases.\n- The `\\s*` between sections allows some flexibility for optional whitespace/newlines between sections.\n\n### Recommended Regex Flags:\nYou indicated the flags \"gi\" (global, case-insensitive). In many regex engines:\n- `g` (global): matches all occurrences.\n- `i` (case-insensitive): matches regardless of case.\n- Optionally add `s` (single-line mode, dot matches newline) if you intend to match multiline content.\n\nFinal recommended flags: \n```regex\ngis\n```\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe original regex is unnecessarily complex. The simplified form above retains the intent clearly, is much easier to maintain, and performs identically in functionality.",
