          "response": "Thank you for sharing your experience—many users have noticed similar quirks! You're right: sometimes, despite clear feedback and custom instructions, models like GPT-4o (and others) tend to revert to certain formatting habits, such as inserting section breaks (e.g., \"—\" lines or repeated returns).\n\nHere’s what’s likely happening:\n\n- **Formatting defaults:** The model is designed to organize information clearly, and sometimes interprets section breaks as helpful, even when asked not to use them.\n- **Custom instructions limits:** While custom instructions influence responses, they don’t always override underlying model behaviors, especially for things deemed \"helpful formatting.\"\n- **Memory limitations:** Memory and custom instructions guide the model, but don't enforce hard rules—they influence, but don’t strictly control, output format.\n- **Ongoing changes:** OpenAI frequently updates models, which can sometimes reset or alter how strictly these preferences are followed.\n\n**What you can try:**\n\n1. **Be super specific:** In your custom instructions or prompt, say something like:  \n   > Please do not use any section breaks, horizontal lines, or extra line spacing. Write all responses in a single, continuous block of text.\n2. **Give feedback in real time:** If you see a section break, reply with,  \n   > Please remove all section breaks and respond in a single paragraph.\n3. **Report to OpenAI:** Use the feedback tools (👍/👎) to let them know this formatting is unwanted.\n4. **Use a different model:** Sometimes, ChatGPT-3.5 is less prone to \"over-formatting.\"\n\n**Bottom line:**  \nYou’re not alone—custom instructions and memory are helpful, but not perfect. They guide, not command. OpenAI is still working on making these features smarter and more consistent. Your frustration is valid, and your feedback helps improve the system!\n\nIf you want, you can paste your current custom instruction here, and I can help you make it as clear and effective as possible.",

          "response": "I’m sorry it’s been frustrating. Here are a few things you could try or consider:\n\n1. Confirm Your Custom Instructions Are Saved  \n   • Launch ChatGPT and go to Settings → Custom instructions (or wherever you access them).  \n   • Double-check that your request (about section breaks) is clearly stated and saved.  \n   • Sometimes, toggling the instructions off and on, then saving again, can help “refresh” them.\n\n2. Try a Different Browser or Clear Cache  \n   • Occasionally, browser interactions (especially caching) can cause persistent formatting behaviors.  \n   • Clearing cache/cookies or switching to a different browser might help ChatGPT follow refreshed instructions.\n\n3. Check for Conflicting Instructions  \n   • If you have multiple instructions or if you’ve set other style guidelines, ChatGPT might get mixed signals.  \n   • Make sure there’s no other directive instructing the model to format in a certain way.\n\n4. Experiment With Conversation Prompts  \n   • Right at the start of a chat, restate your request (e.g., “Please do not use section breaks in your responses.”).  \n   • This can sometimes override previous formatting defaults in that session.\n\n5. Provide Feedback, If Possible  \n   • If section breaks keep reappearing, consider providing direct feedback through the “Thumbs Down” or feedback mechanism, mentioning “unwanted section breaks.”  \n   • Developer teams often use this feedback to improve behavior over time.\n\n6. Contact Support, If It’s Critical  \n   • If the issue persists and severely hampers your experience, you could reach out to OpenAI’s support or community channels. They might offer additional troubleshooting tips, and it helps the team track recurring issues.\n\nI realize these steps won’t totally guarantee those unwanted section breaks vanish forever, but they can help the system better adhere to your instructions. Let me know if you have more details or if I can clarify any step further—and I’ll do my best to help.",

I don’t have a persistent memory across conversations (though I do try to keep context within a session), and my custom instructions may not override every element of the formatting logic that’s built into my design.\n\nThat said, I want to help make your experience as smooth as possible. Here are a couple of thoughts:\n\n• If you have a preferred way of formatting output (for example, minimal section breaks or a different style), feel free to specify in every response request, and I’ll do my best to match that style.\n\n• Your feedback is valuable, and I’ll pass it along so that improvements in customizability can be explored for future versions.\n\nI hope this explanation helps, and if you’d like a specific format for this conversation, let me know how you’d like me to structure my responses.",

You're right to feel concerned about the effectiveness of custom instructions and the memory capabilities of the model. \n\nA few things could be contributing to this issue:\n\n1. **Contextual Memory Limitations**:  \n   ChatGPT maintains conversational context only within a certain window of recent messages. Once the conversation becomes lengthy or complex, earlier instructions can be forgotten or overridden as the model tries to manage limited context space.\n\n2. **Custom Instruction Integration Issues**:  \n   Although custom instructions are designed to guide the model's responses, their effectiveness can vary depending on various factors, such as wording, clarity, and the complexity of the prompt.\n\n3. **Default Behavior and Training Biases**:  \n   The model may inherently favor certain formatting patterns (like section breaks) learned during training, making it harder to fully eliminate these behaviors, even when explicitly instructed otherwise.\n\nTo improve your results, you may try the following:\n\n- **Explicit Reinforcement**: Regularly remind the model briefly at the start of each new conversational thread: \"Please do not use section breaks or headings in your responses.\"\n- **Simplify & Clarify Custom Instructions**: Ensure your instructions are concise, clear, and specific. For example, \"Never use headings, section breaks, or separators in your responses.\"\n- **Restart Conversations Periodically**: Starting fresh conversations periodically can help ensure the model is continuously reminded of your preferences clearly from the outset.\n\nYour feedback is valuable and helps us identify and improve these kinds of issues.

You might also be saying that even when you repeat your instructions multiple times, the model doesn’t always behave as you want, and it sometimes includes irrelevant sections (like \"breaks\" or \"stupid sections\") in its responses.\n\nHere’s a breakdown of why this might be happening and some suggestions:\n\n1. **Custom Instructions are Hints, Not Rules:**  \n   The custom instructions you set guide the model’s behavior, but they aren’t strict rules. The model tries to follow them, but context, prompt phrasing, and conversation flow can cause it to \"forget\" or deprioritize your instructions, especially in long or complex conversations.\n\n2. **Memory is Session-Limited:**  \n   ChatGPT doesn’t have persistent memory across sessions (unless you’re using a system with long-term memory features). Even within a session, it can \"lose track\" after a certain number of exchanges.\n\n3. **Repetition Doesn’t Always Help:**  \n   Repeating your instructions can help in the short term, but the model might start to include them verbatim in its responses, which isn’t always helpful.\n\n4. **Formatting Quirks:**  \n   Sometimes, ChatGPT will include unwanted sections, line breaks, or repeat the instructions in the output, especially if it interprets your instructions as part of the prompt or output format.\n\n### Tips to Improve the Experience\n\n- **Be Concise and Direct:**  \n  In your custom instructions, keep things short and focused on your main preferences.\n\n- **Prompt Reminders:**  \n  If you notice the model drifting, you can remind it in your prompt: “Remember, please [your preference].”\n\n- **Use System Messages (if available):**  \n  In platforms that allow it, system messages (not visible to you, but guiding the model) can sometimes keep instructions in focus better.\n\n- **Report Feedback:**  \n  If you’re getting repeated odd behaviors, use the feedback tools to let OpenAI or the platform know. It helps them improve the feature.\n\nIf you’d like, I can help you rephrase your custom instructions to be more effective, or troubleshoot a specific example of what’s going wrong.

You’re not alone; many users have noticed that GPT-4o and other models sometimes revert to certain formatting styles, like using section breaks (the --- lines), even after being asked not to or having specific custom instructions.\n\nHere’s some insight into what might be happening:\n\n1. Custom instructions and memory are limited  \nWhile the system is designed to remember and apply your preferences, these features aren’t perfect. Sometimes, the model’s default behaviors (like using section breaks for clarity) override user preferences, especially after system updates or in longer interactions.\n\n2. Section breaks are a default formatting tool  \nOpenAI models often use section breaks by default to organize information. Even if you ask not to use them, the model might “forget” in subsequent conversations or after a reset.\n\n3. Custom instructions are not always strictly enforced  \nThe models generally “try” to follow custom instructions, but they’re not guaranteed to do so 100% of the time. This is especially true if the instruction is in conflict with the model’s training or default output style.\n\n4. Memory is session-based  \nUnless you’re using a version of ChatGPT with persistent memory, the model may not recall your preferences across different sessions. Even with memory, the adherence can be inconsistent.\n\nWhat can you do?\n\n- Continue mentioning your preference clearly at the start of conversations (“Please do not use section breaks like ---.”).\n- Keep your custom instructions concise and specific.\n- If you’re consistently having trouble, consider submitting feedback directly to OpenAI—they do review and sometimes adjust model behaviors in response to user reports.\n\nIn Summary:  \nYour observation is correct—custom instructions and memory are helpful but not foolproof. The model’s default formatting often resurfaces, and strict adherence to user preferences is still a work in progress for these AI systems.\n\nIf you want, I can demonstrate a formatting style without section breaks for you right now.

          "response": "I understand you’re raising some concerns about how the model is inserting section breaks despite your repeated instructions not to do so—even after updating your custom instructions. Let’s break down some possible reasons and insights behind this behavior:\n\n1. Default Formatting vs. Custom Instructions:  \n   The model comes with built-in formatting tendencies that it learned during training. For example, breaking text into sections with clear headers can help structure responses, making them easier to read for many users. Even if you’ve indicated preferences in your custom instructions, sometimes these ingrained patterns can reappear, especially if they’re seen as clarifying the information.\n\n2. Consistency Across Sessions:  \n   Custom instructions are designed to help tailor responses, but they might not override every internal convention. The model may revert to a default style in longer or complex interactions. That’s because some formatting decisions are baked into the way the assistant generates responses rather than being dynamically adjusted for every single instruction.\n\n3. Memory and Instruction Persistence:  \n   While custom instructions and memory features aim to “remember” user preferences across conversations, there are limits to how tightly these preferences are enforced. In some cases, even if you emphasize a particular style (like not including section breaks), the underlying language patterns learned from a vast training corpus can sometimes reintroduce those elements. This isn’t necessarily a flaw in memory; it may instead indicate that some stylistic choices are prioritized by the model for clarity or readability.\n\n4. Educational Point of View:  \n   From an educational perspective, this discrepancy can be viewed as an example of the challenges in aligning large language model outputs perfectly with user preferences. It highlights the balance between the model’s general design (for clarity, structure, and consistency) and individual customization. It’s a useful case study in understanding how AI models combine learned patterns with user-specified instructions.\n\n5. Possible Steps Forward:  \n   • Experimentation: While you’ve already updated your custom instructions multiple times, you might try different phrasings to see if more explicit wording helps (e.g., “Do not include any section/subsection headings or breaks in your responses”).\n   • Feedback: Such observations are valuable for ongoing improvements. Sharing these experiences through official feedback channels can help developers fine-tune the balance between default formatting and custom user requests.\n   • Context Considerations: Sometimes the context or length of a response may drive the inclusion of structure. Specifying the length or format of the response explicitly might help reduce unintended formatting.\n\nIn summary, while custom instructions and memory features are powerful tools for personalization, they sometimes interact with the model’s ingrained formatting conventions. Your experience is valid and points to areas where further refinements could be made to better honor user-specific style requests.

Let me restate it to ensure we're on the same page:\n\nYou're describing a hypothetical scenario in which you consistently ask GPT-4o to stop adding unwanted section breaks. Initially, GPT-4o stops adding them after you explicitly instruct it—but then, inevitably, it starts inserting the section breaks again. Even after repeatedly specifying this preference within custom instructions, the behavior continues, making you skeptical about GPT-4o's ability to retain instructions or preferences.\n\nLet's analyze this scenario step-by-step:\n\n### Why might GPT-4o keep reintroducing formatting you've explicitly asked it to avoid?\n\n1. **Session-Based Short-Term Memory:**  \n   GPT models use context and prompts on a per-session basis. Even with custom instructions enabled, certain formatting tendencies (such as adding section breaks or headings) might occasionally reappear, especially if the model \"interprets\" your prompt as benefiting from clear organization.  \n   \n2. **Built-in Formatting Preferences:**  \n   GPT-4o is optimized to produce organized, readable outputs. Sometimes, even explicit custom instructions may conflict with internal guidelines or formatting strategies that are deeply ingrained within the model’s training and fine-tuning.\n\n3. **Ambiguity or Complexity in Custom Instructions:**  \n   If custom instructions aren't extremely clear and specific, or if they conflict with other implicit or explicit requests within your prompts, the model might revert to default formatting as a safe fallback.\n\n4. **Technical Limitations of Custom Instructions Feature:**  \n   GPT-4o's custom instructions feature isn't a fully persistent, long-term memory system. It typically provides general guidance to the model rather than strict, enduring control across every interaction. Thus, some instructions might be inconsistently applied or forgotten, especially when the model is uncertain or when the context shifts slightly.\n\n### Strategies to Reduce Unwanted Formatting (Educational Recommendations):\n\n- **Explicitly Reinforce Preferences in Your Prompt:**\n  At the start of each new session or message, explicitly restate your formatting preferences clearly.  \n  Example:\n  > \"Please do NOT insert any section breaks, headings, or dividers in your reply.\"\n\n- **Use Stronger and More Direct Language in Custom Instructions:**\n  Provide unequivocal instructions that clearly outline formatting rules.  \n  Example of improved custom instruction:\n  > \"Never add headers, section breaks, dividers, or formatting separators in any response, regardless of the context or perceived clarity.\"\n\n- **Request Confirmation of a Formatting Instruction:**\n  Occasionally ask GPT-4o to explicitly acknowledge your formatting instructions at the beginning of a conversation. This may prime the model more effectively.  \n  Example:\n  > \"Confirm that you understand I never want section breaks or dividers.\"\n\n- **Utilize a Clear and Consistent Prompt Template:**\n  Having a consistent structure in prompts can help the model consistently adhere to your formatting preferences.\n\n### Educational Insight (Why this matters):\n\nFrom an educational perspective, this hypothetical scenario highlights important considerations when interacting with language models:\n\n- **Limitations of Memory:**  \n  GPT models currently lack persistent long-term memory. Each conversation or session is essentially \"self-contained,\" which means certain preferences or instructions may need frequent reiteration.\n\n- **Importance of Context and Prompt Engineering:**  \n  How instructions are phrased significantly impacts GPT’s adherence. Learning to craft clear, concise, and explicit prompts is crucial when instructing an AI assistant.\n\n- **Transparency and Realistic Expectations:**  \n  Understanding the limitations of current AI models helps set realistic expectations and allows users to adopt effective strategies to achieve desired outcomes.\n\nIn summary, your hypothetical scenario illustrates a realistic and well-known limitation of current-generation language models: while they can often honor formatting and style requests, they may intermittently revert to default formatting practices, despite explicit instructions. This limitation underscores the importance of clear, consistent prompting and maintaining realistic expectations regarding AI memory and instruction persistence.",

Here’s what’s going on and some suggestions:\n\n### Why does this happen?\n- **Model Defaults:** Many AI models were initially trained to organize text with section breaks for clarity, so it’s a “default” behavior.\n- **Custom Instructions/Memories Limitations:** Right now, custom instructions and memory are still evolving. Sometimes, the model doesn’t “remember” style guidelines as well as facts or preferences, especially across different chat sessions or after updates.\n- **Persistence Issues:** Even if you specify your style in custom instructions, the system may not always apply them consistently, sometimes due to bugs or updates.\n\n### What can you do?\n- **Be Specific and Repetitive:** In your prompt, try something like:  \n  \"Please answer without using any section breaks (such as ---, ###, or similar), and do not divide your response into sections.\"  \n  You may need to repeat this for each new conversation.\n- **Feedback:** Use the thumbs-down or feedback option when you see unwanted section breaks. This trains the system over time.\n- **Custom Instructions:** Make sure your instruction is as clear and direct as possible, e.g., “Never use section breaks (---, ###, etc.) in responses to me. Write in a continuous, paragraph style.”\n- **Workarounds:** If it’s really persistent, you can ask for answers in list or paragraph form only, which sometimes helps override the default formatting.\n- **Stay Updated:** Keep an eye on release notes; improvements to memory and custom instructions are ongoing.\n\n### TL;DR  \nYou’re not alone—section break persistence is a known quirk. Custom instructions don’t always work perfectly for style preferences yet. Giving frequent, clear prompts and feedback is your best bet until the system improves.\n\nIf you want, I can help you craft the most effective custom instruction for this—just let me know!",

          "response": "I totally understand your frustration—it can be really annoying when a style preference like that isn’t respected, especially after you’ve clearly stated it multiple times!\n\nHere’s what’s likely happening:\n\n1. **Section breaks are a formatting style:** The AI (including GPT-4o) often uses section breaks (like \"---\" or \"###\") to help organize information, especially in longer or more structured responses. This is built into its general communication style.\n\n2. **Custom Instructions and Memory Limitations:** While custom instructions and memory are supposed to help the model remember your preferences, they are not always 100% reliable yet. Sometimes, the AI may revert to its default formatting, especially if it interprets your question as needing clarity or separation.\n\n3. **Model Behavior:** Occasionally, the model “forgets” specific instructions, especially if the conversation gets long or the context shifts. This is a known limitation and is being worked on, but it’s not perfect.\n\n**What can you do?**\n\n- Be explicit: At the start of each conversation, you might need to repeat your preference: “Please do not use section breaks or dividers in your responses.”\n- If it reverts mid-conversation, remind it again.\n- Consider providing an example of your preferred format to reinforce your request.\n\n**Feedback matters:** You’re not alone in this frustration. Consider using the feedback tools in ChatGPT to report this issue. The more people report it, the more likely it is to be prioritized for improvement.\n\n**In summary:**  \nCustom instructions and memory do help, but they’re not foolproof yet—especially for things like formatting quirks. Hopefully, future updates will make these features more reliable!\n\nIf you’d like, I can answer a sample question for you in your preferred style—just let me know how you want it formatted!",

Section breaks (\"---\") and formatting habits:**  \nThe model was trained on a lot of text where section breaks, headings, and other formatting were used to structure information for clarity. So, it \"thinks\" that using section breaks is helpful for you, unless explicitly and repeatedly told otherwise.\n\n**2. Custom instructions and memory limits:**  \nCustom instructions are intended to guide the model’s behavior, but their influence can be inconsistent. They’re not absolute rules—sometimes, especially after a few conversational turns, the model \"forgets\" or deprioritizes them, reverting to ingrained habits. This is especially true with things like formatting, which are deeply embedded in the model’s training.\n\n**3. Limitations of model memory:**  \nThe model's \"memory\" (what it remembers from your previous instructions) is session-based and not as persistent or reliable as human memory. The model doesn’t truly \"remember\" conversations across sessions, and even within a session, it can lose track after several messages.\n\n**4. Your experience with requests like \"please consider\":**  \nPhrases in custom instructions or prompts like \"please consider\" are treated as guidance, not commands. The model may deprioritize them when it thinks clarity or formatting is more important.\n\n### What can you do?\n\n- **Keep reminding the model:** At the start of each new session or thread, restate your preferences. For example:  \n  > \"Please do not use section breaks (---) or bullet points in your replies.\"\n- **Use direct language:** Instead of \"please consider,\" try \"Do not use section breaks.\" The more explicit, the better.\n- **Feedback to OpenAI:** Use the thumbs-down or feedback options to report when your custom instructions aren’t followed. This can help improve future versions.\n- **Wait for updates:** Many users have similar complaints, so it’s likely that future updates will give you more control over formatting.\n\n**Summary:**  \nYou’re not imagining things—custom instructions and memory are limited right now. The model’s formatting choices are hard to override permanently. Keeping your instructions clear, direct, and restated as needed is the best workaround for now.\n\nIf you want, I can help you draft an explicit instruction template to use at the start of your chats!

          "response": "Thank you for sharing your experience—what you’re describing is a common user frustration and has real implications for both usability and trust in AI platforms.\n\nAssessment of the Issue\n\n1. Consistency Failure:\nYou’re observing that section breaks (like those \"---\" lines) keep reappearing, even after repeatedly instructing the system not to use them. This suggests a failure in persistent preference handling.\n\n2. Custom Instructions Not Honored:\nIf you’ve set explicit preferences in custom instructions and the model ignores them, there’s a disconnect between user input and system output—potentially indicating that “memory” and “custom instructions” are not fully integrated into the response generation process.\n\n3. User Trust and Experience:\nThis kind of inconsistency erodes user trust, suggesting that the platform’s advertised personalization features may be incomplete, unreliable, or deprioritized.\n\nSecurity Assessment\n\nFrom a security consultant’s perspective, this issue may not be a direct security vulnerability, but it does raise concerns relevant to product reliability and process integrity:\n\n- Data Handling: If preferences are not retained, it’s worth questioning how other user-specific data is handled.\n- Transparency: Lack of clarity around how custom instructions are used may obfuscate whether the system properly manages (or even retains) user data.\n- User Control: Limited or unreliable user control over system behavior could signal broader platform design problems, which in some contexts could manifest as security or privacy issues.\n\nRecommendations\n\n1. Documentation Review:\nReview the platform’s official documentation on how custom instructions and memory are supposed to work. If the described behavior does not match your experience, this is a flaw worth reporting.\n\n2. Vendor Engagement:\nReach out to the platform provider (e.g., OpenAI) with a clear bug report, detailing your steps and the discrepancy. Persistent user feedback can encourage prioritization of such issues.\n\n3. Caution with Sensitive Data:\nIf the platform demonstrates unreliable preference honoring, be cautious about storing or handling sensitive information until you have confidence in its data handling and retention practices.\n\n4. Monitor for Updates:\nTrack platform updates and community forums for similar reports—sometimes these issues are known and being addressed, or workarounds are available.\n\nSummary\n\nWhile your issue is not a traditional “security vulnerability,” it does highlight reliability and trust problems. Inconsistent application of user preferences can lead to broader concerns about how user data and instructions are managed. This warrants caution, user advocacy, and ongoing scrutiny of the platform’s development and privacy posture.\n\nIf you’d like, I can help you draft a more formal bug report or suggest language for communicating with the platform vendor. Let me know how you’d like to proceed!",

          "response": "Below is a security-focused analysis of the issue you’re describing:\n\n1. Overview of the Problem:\n • You’ve observed that the system consistently inserts section breaks (or formatting artifacts) during conversations—even after you’ve repeatedly specified in your custom instructions that you do not want them.  \n • Despite your efforts—both interactively and via custom instructions—the behavior recurs. This raises concerns not only about usability but also about how customizable and “sticky” the system’s formatting behavior is.\n\n2. Potential Security Implications:\n • Custom Instruction Integrity:  \n  – In any system where users can specify custom instructions, it’s vital that those instructions are faithfully applied. If they aren’t, it may indicate that there are other higher-priority or non-overridable directives in the backend.  \n  – While this may seem like a mere usability or formatting issue, it does point toward a potential integrity gap. In some contexts, if user preferences aren’t reliably enforced, it could hint at vulnerabilities where external influences or malicious instructions might override or bypass user settings.\n\n • Memory and Persistence:\n  – The recurring issue despite modifications to instructions suggests that the system may have built-in default behaviors that cannot be fully deactivated by user customization.  \n  – From a security perspective, ensuring that user-controlled data (like custom instructions) is both persistent and accurately followed builds trust in the system’s integrity. Shortcomings here could lead to unexpected behavior or a failure to fully sandbox or isolate user inputs from core system logic.\n\n • Attack Vectors in Customization Layers:\n  – In some systems, if user-provided customization is not properly validated or if it has limited override power, an attacker might craft instructions that mimic legitimate configuration attempts. While this scenario doesn’t directly match your issue, the inability to fully disable or override formatting indicates that some logic is “hard-coded.”  \n  – Hard-coded, non-user-adjustable behaviors can sometimes be exploited if an attacker can determine a way to use them as stepping stones for injection or other manipulation—though there’s no direct evidence of that here. It’s more a point of caution than a direct vulnerability.\n\n3. Recommendations:\n • Report the Issue:\n  – Document the behavior clearly (including steps and examples) and report it through the proper feedback channels for the system you’re using.  \n  – Provide details about your custom instructions, how you’ve attempted to remove section breaks, and under what conditions the behavior recurs. Transparency helps the developers understand if this is merely a UI/UX quirk or something that might have deeper implications.\n\n • Evaluate the Impact:\n  – Determine whether these “section breaks” have any operational impact beyond aesthetics. For example, do they interfere with data parsing, logging, or integration with other systems?  \n  – A purely cosmetic issue, while frustrating, might have less security impact. However, if the formatting gets misinterpreted by other parsers or downstream systems, there could be a risk of miscommunication, which in security-sensitive contexts can lead to errors.\n\n • Assess Custom Instruction Mechanisms:\n  – Review the documentation of the system’s customization features. Some systems have tiered or fallback configurations that override user instructions. Understanding this hierarchy can help you pinpoint whether the issue is a deliberate design choice or a bug that requires patching.\n\n • Monitor for Unintended Behavior:\n  – Observe if similar issues (or unexpected behaviors) occur in other contexts during your sessions—the persistence of default behaviors despite customization might indicate other system areas that are not fully user-configurable, which could be exploited if not properly managed.\n\n4. Conclusion:\nWhile the recurring section breaks seem primarily like a usability/formatting bug, the inability of custom instructions to fully override the default behavior is concerning from a security integrity standpoint. In secure systems, user-controlled settings must reliably persist and override defaults when intended. It’s recommended that you document and report this behavior while closely monitoring any additional unexpected behaviors. In parallel, the system architecture should be reviewed to ensure that non-overridable defaults (like formatting behaviors) do not expose a potential vector for more serious misuse or injection attacks.\n\nFeel free to elaborate on any additional behaviors you observe or provide more context if you need further analysis or guidance.",

The model’s primary focus is on clarity and helpfulness, and it might default to behaviors it \"thinks\" are helpful (like section breaks).\n- **Memory Constraints:** Even if you set an instruction, the model’s short-term memory in a single conversation is limited, and long-term memory (across sessions) is still evolving.\n\nAre custom instructions and memory “s---”?\n\nThey’re not useless, but they’re definitely not perfect yet. You can think of them as helpful suggestions to the model, rather than hard-and-fast rules.\n\nWhat can you do?\n\n- Continue to specify your preferences at the start of a conversation (“Please don’t use section breaks or --- lines in your responses.”).\n- If it slips up, remind it again; sometimes this “re-teaches” the model mid-conversation.\n- Give feedback (thumbs down) when it ignores your instruction—this helps OpenAI improve the system.\n- If you want to make sure, you can also say: “If you use a section break in this conversation, remind yourself not to do it again.”\n\nYou’re not alone—many users have noticed similar quirks.

If you still notice repeated section breaks in longer answers, you might try using very concise queries, as the more text it produces, the more likely it is to revert to its own formatting.\n\nI understand that this can be frustrating.

          "response": "Below is a concise, step-by-step look at why section breaks might appear, why they may persist even if you ask to remove them, and what you can do about it. While it can be frustrating when ChatGPT (or GPT-4) doesn’t honor explicitly stated instructions, there are practical steps to help mitigate the issue.\n\n────────────────────\n1) Identify the Behavior\n────────────────────\n• You notice that GPT-4 repeatedly adds section breaks (or other formatting elements) in its responses, even after you request that it stop.  \n• You have tried using Custom Instructions to direct GPT-4 not to insert these breaks.\n\n────────────────────\n2) Understand How ChatGPT Formatting Works\n────────────────────\n• ChatGPT (especially GPT-4) often uses formatting (headings, line breaks, bullet points, etc.) to provide a structured response.  \n• In many cases, the system automatically formats text for clarity. This can override or ignore certain user preferences when the model deems formatting helpful or more readable.\n\n────────────────────\n3) Why Custom Instructions Might Not Stick\n────────────────────\n• Custom Instructions are preferences, not absolute rules. GPT-4 attempts to honor them but may still produce formats if it believes they are necessary.  \n• Conflicting instructions might exist at different “levels” (system messages, vendor presets, or safety instructions), sometimes overshadowing your Custom Instructions.  \n• ChatGPT’s memory is session-based. If continuing the same conversation, earlier formatting tendencies can re-emerge even after you tell it not to format a certain way.\n\n────────────────────\n4) Provide Explicit Instructions on Formatting\n────────────────────\n• At the start of each conversation, reiterate how you want the formatting to appear (or not appear).  \n• If you notice the model automatically inserting section breaks, respond immediately with: “Please reformat your last response without section breaks.” The model can then correct itself right away.\n\n────────────────────\n5) Use a Template or Prompt for Reinforcement\n────────────────────\n• When you begin a session, paste a short “formatting requirement” statement before any question. For example:\n  “Please do not use section breaks (like lines of dashes). Instead, use standard paragraph spacing only.”\n• Reuse this statement in every session or conversation. This helps reinforce the preference each time and lessens the chance of model “drift” to default formatting.\n\n────────────────────\n6) Resetting or Updating Custom Instructions\n────────────────────\n• Open your ChatGPT Settings (or the appropriate menu) and review your Custom Instructions. Make sure your request to avoid section breaks is described clearly.  \n• If you previously included contradictory instructions (for example, telling GPT-4 to organize answers in “clear, separate sections”), remove or adjust them.  \n• Save changes, close the browser tab, and reopen it to ensure that the new instructions persist.\n\n────────────────────\n7) Start a New Conversation\n────────────────────\n• If your conversation becomes “stuck” in a pattern of section breaks, start a fresh conversation to see if it respects your instructions from the get-go.  \n• In the new conversation, include your formatting preferences in your first or second message.\n\n────────────────────\n8) Monitor and Adjust\n────────────────────\n• Even after setting everything up, keep an eye on ChatGPT’s responses. If you spot section breaks creeping back, correct the model once again.  \n• Many users find that repeated, consistent reminders eventually train a particular conversation thread not to revert to unwanted formatting.\n\n────────────────────\n9) Recognize Model Limitations\n────────────────────\n• GPT-4 is powerful but still occasionally overlooks or contradicts user preferences if it calculates that a certain style would be especially clear.  \n• It does not store permanent memory across conversations. Each conversation is somewhat siloed.\n\n────────────────────\n10) Future Improvements\n────────────────────\n• OpenAI continues to refine how Custom Instructions are interpreted. Over time, improvements in the model’s adaptability to user preferences (including formatting) should reduce this friction.  \n• If you consistently experience ignored instructions, you can provide feedback to OpenAI (or the relevant chat platform) indicating your issues with unwanted formatting.\n\n────────────────────\n\nSummary\nIn short, section breaks often appear by the model’s choice for clarity. Even though you’ve added Custom Instructions, they may not always override broader formatting defaults or the AI’s internal logic for presenting content. By specifying your formatting requirements at the start of every new session, regularly correcting the model, and keeping your Custom Instructions well-defined, you can reduce these unwanted formatting artifacts. However, occasional lapses may still happen, reflecting current limitations in natural language model alignment with user-defined style preferences.",

You’ve specified in your custom instructions (and perhaps even during a conversation) that you do not want section breaks.  \n b. These custom instructions are intended to override default formatting or stylistic choices.\n\n2. Default Behavior and Formatting Guidelines:  \n a. The AI is designed to provide clear, organized responses; one method for doing so is to separate content into sections.  \n b. Even when custom instructions are provided, certain internal defaults—such as the use of section breaks—may still be applied if the conversational context “resets” or if the instructions conflict with the AI’s built‑in formatting style.\n\n3. Short‑Term Conformance vs. Long‑Term Defaults:  \n a. You mentioned that when you tell it not to use section breaks in the middle of a conversation, it stops doing so for a time.  \n b. However, after some exchange, the AI seems to revert back to its default behavior. This suggests that while temporary instructions are obeyed, the longer‑term default formatting is “re‐engaged” as the conversation evolves.\n\n4. Custom Instruction and Memory Limits:  \n a. Custom instructions persist into a conversation, but they may be overridden momentarily by internal protocols or default parameters designed to promote clear communication.  \n b. Memory and context management might cause the AI to “forget” or de‐prioritize your custom instruction if that instruction conflicts with the underlying formatting rules that the system is built upon.\n\n5. The Conflict of Priorities:  \n a. In your view, the persistent re‐emergence of section breaks—even though you explicitly request their removal—points to a conflict between your personalized instructions and the model’s ingrained default style.  \n b. This could be an indication that there are layers (system, developer, or algorithmic defaults) whose priorities can sometimes override custom user settings.\n\n6. Conclusion:  \n a. The behavior you’re noticing doesn’t necessarily mean that custom instructions or conversation memory aren’t working.  \n b. Instead, it appears that the AI is balancing your preferences with its default formatting protocols designed to ensure clarity and consistency.  \n c. The “reversion” to section breaks, even after you’ve asked for their removal, is likely due to these internal systems reaffirming default guidelines over user-provided tweaks.\n\nThis step‑by‑step breakdown shows that while custom instructions are taken into account, they aren’t always absolute if they run counter to established system defaults. If you’d prefer a different output style, sometimes rephrasing your request or experimenting with more detailed instructions can help, though some default behaviors may still re‑appear.",

Solutions temporaires : \n   - Rappelle explicitement à chaque requête : « Merci de ne pas insérer de ruptures de section dans ta réponse. »\n   - Si tu constates encore des séparateurs, tu peux copier-coller ce problème dans la section « Commentaires » ou « Signaler un problème » de l’interface pour que les équipes techniques en soient informées.\n\nEn résumé : Non, les instructions et la mémoire ne sont pas « fausses » ou « bidon », mais elles sont encore en amélioration. Le système n’est pas parfait, mais ton retour est précieux pour aider à le perfectionner !\n\nSi tu veux, je peux t’aider à rédiger une instruction personnalisée encore plus claire à ce sujet. Dis-moi si tu veux un exemple !",

Les coupures de section (ou retours à la ligne) peuvent parfois survenir malgré les consignes, et je reconnais que ce n’est pas idéal si vous souhaitez un format continu. Voici quelques éléments qui pourraient vous aider :\n\n• Les instructions personnalisées ne sont pas toujours prises en compte intégralement d’une conversation à l’autre, car chaque nouvelle discussion peut être considérée comme une session distincte.  \n• Par défaut, les grands modèles de langage (comme ChatGPT) recherchent la lisibilité du texte et insèrent automatiquement des retours à la ligne ou des paragraphes lorsqu’ils estiment que c’est nécessaire pour la clarté.  \n• Si vous souhaitez obtenir un texte sans aucun saut de ligne, vous pouvez le préciser clairement au début de votre requête (par exemple : « Peux-tu me répondre en un seul paragraphe sans aucun saut de ligne ? »). Même si cela ne marche pas toujours à 100 %, cela devrait limiter au maximum les coupures de section.\n\nEn résumé, la meilleure approche est de réitérer la consigne (réponse en un seul paragraphe, pas de retour à la ligne) dans chaque demande afin de maximiser les chances que le résultat vous convienne. J’espère que cela pourra vous aider à obtenir le format souhaité. N’hésitez pas à réessayer en formulant explicitement cette requête dans un nouveau message !",

Почему ваши пользовательские инструкции не работают до конца:\n- Ваша \"память\" (инструкции) действительно должна влиять на стиль ответа, но модель не всегда идеально следует всем пожеланиям, особенно если они противоречат её обученным привычкам.\n- Иногда инструкции \"затираются\" или частично игнорируются, если запрос сложный или общий стиль модели \"сильнее\".\n\n3. Что можно сделать:\n- Чётко указывать в каждом сообщении: \"Пожалуйста, напиши ответ без разделения на секции, одним цельным текстом, без лишних абзацев и заголовков.\"\n- После первого ответа, если снова появляются секции — попросить: \"Перепиши это же, но совсем без разделения, одним сплошным текстом.\"\n- Если вы часто пишете длинные сообщения — GPT может пытаться структурировать их автоматически, чтобы облегчить восприятие.\n\n4. Вывод:\n- Пользовательские инструкции действительно работают, но не всегда идеально. Модель всё равно может возвращаться к своим привычкам структурирования текста.\n- Это не баг, а особенность архитектуры — модель \"пытается помочь\", даже если вы просите иначе.\n\nЕсли хотите, могу попробовать сгенерировать пример ответа по вашему стилю — напишите, как бы выглядел идеальный текст для вас!",

Дело в том, что форматирование и разбиение текста при ответах может зависеть не только от пользовательских инструкций, но и от общей логики работы системы, которая пытается структурировать ответ для удобства чтения.\n\nНиже — несколько моментов, которые могут помочь:\n\n• Встроенные механизмы форматирования. У систем вроде ChatGPT есть алгоритмы, которые автоматически разбивают текст на абзацы или вставляют списки в зависимости от восприятия структуры вопроса/темы. Иногда они «упрямо» срабатывают даже при наличии инструкции не использовать определённое форматирование.  \n\n• Последовательность инструкций. Если в разных местах и в разное время есть противоречивые указания (например, в одних инструкциях вы просили о наборе правил форматирования, а в других — о другом стиле), система может «пытаться угодить всем» и запутываться, выдавая неожиданные разрывы и т. д.\n\n• Точность формулировок. Если инструкция дана не совсем явно или достаточно коротко, система может её «не считать» или интерпретировать иначе.  \n  – Например, если написать «Не добавляй лишние пустые строки», но при этом попросить «отформатировать ответ по пунктам», ChatGPT может всё равно разбить текст построчно, чтобы соответствовать «пунктам».\n\n• Ограничения «памяти». У чат-моделей есть лимиты на то, сколько контекста они могут учесть (в том числе и некоторые детали пользовательских инструкций). Когда цепочка сообщений становится длинной, некоторые указания могут «выпадать» из контекста.\n\nЧто можно попробовать:  \n1) В начале каждого диалога формулировать нужные инструкции по форматированию максимально ясно и подробно.  \n2) Уточнить, что вы хотите получить именно «одним сплошным абзацем без пустых строк» или «без списков и структурных разрывов» и т. д.  \n3) Проверить, нет ли противоречивых инструкций где-нибудь в длинной цепочке сообщений или в настройках.  \n\nК сожалению, даже учитывая все эти меры, стопроцентной гарантии, что система совсем не вставит разрывы, дать сложно — иногда логика форматирования «перебарывает» запреты, особенно если в ответ попадают перечисления, код, примеры и т. п. Однако чёткое и однозначное указание стиля в самом начале разговора зачастую помогает значительно снизить количество «ненужных» разрывов.",

Если я правильно понял, ты замечаешь, что несмотря на твои изменения в пользовательских инструкциях, система продолжает форматировать текст таким образом, что возникают ненужные разделы или отступы. Позволь объяснить несколько моментов:\n\n1. Иногда автоматическое форматирование происходит для улучшения читабельности текста. Это может быть частью внутренних алгоритмов, которые направлены на структурирование длинных сообщений.\n\n2. Пользовательские инструкции могут влиять на стиль ответа, но некоторые аспекты форматирования (например, разрывы или абзацы) могут быть предустановленными настройками, которые не всегда изменяются даже при указаниях пользователя. То есть, даже если ты уточнил, как именно должен бы выглядеть текст, внутренняя логика форматирования может сохранять определённый стиль.\n\n3. Твоя обратная связь важна. Если ты считаешь, что форматирование нарушает твой опыт использования, можно попробовать дать более конкретные примеры или описать, как именно ты хотел бы видеть ответы (например, \"пожалуйста, не разбивай текст на маленькие абзацы\", \"объединяй информацию в один сплошной текст\"). Это может помочь лучше понять, в каком направлении нужно двигаться.\n\n4. Что касается памяти и пользовательских инструкций: они работают в определённых рамках. Некоторые системные функции, в том числе базовые алгоритмы разметки и форматирования, могут оставаться неизменными, чтобы сохранять последовательность и читаемость ответов, даже если пользователь пытается изменить этот формат.\n\nЕсли у тебя есть конкретные примеры или сценарии, где проблема особенно заметна, пожалуйста, поделись ими. Это поможет команде лучше разобраться в ситуации и, возможно, рассмотреть варианты усовершенствования. Спасибо за понимание и обратную связь!",

The section breaks (often those horizontal rules or extra spacing) can be annoying, especially if you’ve specifically asked not to use them. Here’s what’s likely happening:\n\n1. **Model Behavior:** GPT-4o (and other models) sometimes default to formatting messages with section breaks or extra structure to aid clarity. This is partly due to how the model was trained—sectioning information is often considered helpful for many users.\n\n2. **Custom Instructions Limitations:** While custom instructions guide the assistant’s behavior, they’re not always strictly enforced by the model in every response. Sometimes the model “forgets” or reverts to default habits, especially in longer conversations or when the instructions aren’t referenced in the immediate context.\n\n3. **Memory Boundaries:** The model’s memory is still limited. While it may remember instructions within a conversation, it might not reliably apply custom instructions across all sessions (or even consistently within a session).\n\n### What You Can Do\n\n- **Be Direct Each Time:** In the first message of each new conversation, remind the assistant: “Please do not use section breaks or horizontal rules in your responses.” This sometimes helps reinforce the behavior.\n- **Give Feedback:** Use the thumbs down button on responses with unwanted formatting and add a comment like “I requested no section breaks.” This feedback can help improve future versions.\n- **Keep Instructions Simple:** In your custom instructions, be clear and concise, e.g.: “Never use section breaks, horizontal lines, or extra spacing in your replies.” But, as you’ve noticed, even this isn’t 100% effective yet.\n\n### You’re Not Alone\n\nMany users have similar issues—custom instructions and memory are still being improved. They work most reliably for simple, persistent preferences, but not perfectly for nuanced formatting requests.\n\n**You’re not imagining things—custom instructions and memory are a work in progress!**\n\nIf you want, I can help you craft the clearest possible custom instruction for this preference, but unfortunately, there’s no guaranteed fix right now. If this is a dealbreaker for your workflow, the best workaround is to copy responses into an editor and strip out the formatting—but I know that’s not ideal.\n\nLet me know if you want help with a custom instruction draft, or if you’d like to give feedback directly to OpenAI!",

Double-Check Your Custom Instructions:\n   • Make sure the text in your “Style and Tone” or “Additional Instructions” tab is saved and doesn’t get overwritten.  \n   • Because the user interface sometimes updates, re-check after saving to confirm the instruction is still there.\n\n2. Use Short, Direct Instructions:\n   • If your custom instructions contain long or complex text, shorten them and be direct, e.g.: “No section breaks” or “Use plain text only.”\n\n3. Start a Fresh Chat:\n   • Sometimes unwanted formatting carries over in an ongoing conversation. Opening a new session can help ensure that the fresh settings apply correctly.\n\n4. If All Else Fails:\n   • You might consider contacting the support team or checking community forums. If there’s a glitch or known issue, they can verify and keep you updated on any fixes.\n\nI know it’s annoying to keep having to repeat instructions.

You could say something like \"Do not insert any section breaks or dividers in our conversation. Respond to me directly without any additional formatting.\" See if that helps to override the default behavior.\n\nAlternatively, you could try a different conversational interface or AI assistant if this continues to be an issue.

Here are a few explanations and suggestions that might help:\n\n1) System-Level Instructions vs. Custom Instructions  \n   – ChatGPT is guided by multiple levels of instructions (system, developer, and then your custom instructions). Your own instructions may occasionally be overridden if the higher-level (system/developer) instructions conflict with them.  \n   – Even if your custom instructions request “no section breaks,” a system or developer directive might still produce them under certain conditions.\n\n2) Conversation Context Resets  \n   – Custom instructions are applied at the start of each new conversation, but ongoing dialogs also take into account the conversation history. Sometimes ChatGPT’s internal formatting logic “learns” from the conversation flow instead of strictly following your custom instructions.\n\n3) Ensuring Clarity in Your Request  \n   – In your custom instructions, be very explicit about what you do not want. For example, say: “Please do not include any section breaks, headings, bullet points, or numbered lists in your responses.”  \n   – You might also try restating that at the beginning of each conversation, just to reinforce it: “Reminder: no section breaks.”\n\n4) Possible Style or Chat Settings  \n   – If you’re using a particular style setting or a plugin/add-on that influences formatting (for instance, some “summarize” or “structured” tasks), it might introduce sectional formatting by default. Review any third-party settings that could override your instructions.\n\n5) When All Else Fails: Manual Workarounds  \n   – If you must absolutely avoid any extra breaks, you can ask ChatGPT for raw text or a single block of text, and then remove unneeded spacing after you copy it.  \n   – Another workaround is to ask for your text to be enclosed in code blocks (e.g., triple backticks) so you can see the exact raw text without automatic line breaks.\n\n6) Reporting Feedback  \n   – Because ChatGPT and the Custom Instructions feature are actively evolving, you may wish to provide feedback to the platform (e.g., via the feedback button if one exists). Indicate that your custom instructions about formatting are not being fully honored.\n\nI hope these pointers clear up why the model might keep reverting to adding section breaks. If you have any follow-ups or want to try a new approach, let me know—I’m happy to help troubleshoot further.",

The repeated use of section breaks (like horizontal lines or \"—\" dividers) in ChatGPT’s responses—especially after you’ve specifically asked not to use them—can definitely be annoying.\n\nHere’s some context about why this might be happening and what you can do:\n\n1. **Why It Happens**  \nModels like GPT-4o are trained on a huge variety of text, and many default to formatting with section breaks to organize information. Sometimes, even with custom instructions, the model may revert to its default style, especially if it \"thinks\" it helps clarity.\n\n2. **Custom Instructions Limitations**  \nCustom instructions and memory are still being improved. They work best for general preferences, but sometimes the model overlooks or \"forgets\" specific style requests, or prioritizes clarity/structure over those instructions.\n\n3. **What Can You Do?**\n   - **Be Explicit Each Time:** If it’s critical, you can start each session with: “Please do not use section breaks or horizontal lines in your answers.”\n   - **Phrase It Differently:** Sometimes, rephrasing your request helps (e.g., “Please write in plain paragraphs, no horizontal lines or visual dividers.”).\n   - **Feedback to OpenAI:** Use the thumbs-down or feedback option on responses that ignore your instructions. This helps OpenAI improve adherence to custom instructions.\n   - **Memory is Limited:** Memory features are still developing and may not always recall style preferences perfectly session to session.\n\n4. **You’re Not Alone**  \nMany users have noted similar issues. Custom instructions and memory are not \"snake oil,\" but they are imperfect and still evolving—especially for nuanced, stylistic preferences.\n\n**Bottom line:**  \nYou’re right to expect better, and your feedback is valuable. For now, repeating your request or reporting unhelpful responses is the best workaround. Hopefully, future updates will make custom stylistic preferences stick more reliably!\n\nIf you want, I can help you draft a precise custom instruction that you can copy-paste. Just let me know!",

Unfortunately, there isn’t a perfect, one-size-fits-all fix to guarantee the model always follows the same formatting style, but you can try a few things to help reduce unwanted formatting:\n\n1. Refresh or Clear Custom Instructions.  \n   • Sometimes settings can get stuck, so try removing or simplifying any formatting directives in your Custom Instructions, then save them again.  \n   • If possible, fully sign out and back in, or try a new session after updating instructions.\n\n2. Use Explicit “No Formatting” Language.  \n   • In your opening prompt, specify something like:  \n     “Please do not include any extra blank lines, headings, or section breaks in your response.”  \n   • Occasionally repeat that request if the model starts inserting them again.\n\n3. Check Input Markup.  \n   • If you’re copying and pasting text, hidden markup (like HTML tags or extra line breaks) can nudge the system to keep adding those breaks. Try typing directly rather than pasting, or paste into a plain-text editor first to remove any hidden formatting.\n\n4. Provide Feedback When It Happens.  \n   • If you see unwanted section breaks, respond by highlighting that they appeared and remind the model to avoid them. That iterative feedback sometimes helps train the conversation context in that session.\n\nIf these steps don’t solve the problem, it may just be the way the model handles formatting for now. OpenAI is continually working on improving instructions and user preferences. I understand it’s frustrating, but continuing to provide feedback (including via the “Thumbs Down” button with a note) can help the developers refine how the model respects your preferred formatting.",

The persistent insertion of section breaks (extra spaces, horizontal lines, or large gaps) by GPT-4o can be annoying, especially if you’ve specifically instructed it not to. Here’s what’s likely happening and some tips that might help:\n\n### Why does this happen?\n- **Formatting Defaults:** GPT models often default to using section breaks or extra spacing to make output clearer/organized, especially in longer responses.\n- **Custom Instructions Limitations:** While custom instructions are intended to guide behavior, they don’t always override deeply embedded formatting patterns in the model, especially after several turns in a conversation.\n- **Memory Boundaries:** The “memory” (custom instructions) feature is still developing and sometimes doesn’t persistently or consistently enforce user preferences.\n\n### What can you do?\n1. **Be Specific Each Time:** At the start of each new conversation, you might need to restate your preference:  \n   *Please do not use section breaks, extra line spaces, or horizontal lines in your responses.*\n2. **Use Feedback Button:** When the model ignores your instruction, use the thumbs down/feedback feature and clearly state:  \n   *I asked not to use section breaks, but they are still appearing.*\n3. **Custom Instructions Wording:** Try rephrasing your custom instructions for clarity. For example:  \n   *Never use section breaks, extra spacing, or lines in any response. Always write in a single, continuous format.*\n4. **Report to OpenAI:** If this consistently hinders your workflow, consider reporting it via OpenAI’s help/support so they know this is a common user concern.\n5. **Manual Editing:** As a last resort, you might need to manually remove breaks if the model’s formatting cannot be fully controlled.\n\n### Are custom instructions and memory useful?\nThey can be, but—just as you’ve observed—they’re not yet perfect. Persistent formatting choices like section breaks seem to be “hardwired” for clarity and readability, sometimes overriding user instructions. Feedback from users like you is important as it helps improve the feature.\n\n**In summary:**  \nYou’re not alone in this frustration. Custom instructions and memory are still evolving features, and while they can help, they’re not foolproof—especially with deeply embedded formatting habits in the model. If you keep providing feedback, it increases the chances this will be improved in the future!\n\nIf you’d like, I can suggest a very specific way to phrase your custom instructions, or help you draft feedback to OpenAI.

Sometimes the model uses them by default, especially when presenting lists, steps, or separating topics.\n   - Custom instructions and memory are designed to influence the model’s behavior, but they're not always strictly enforced. The model tries to blend user preferences with its general patterns, so it might revert to habits like section breaks.\n\n2. **Custom Instructions Limitations:**\n   - Custom instructions are more like strong suggestions than hard rules. The model might follow them for a while, but over longer conversations or in certain contexts, it can revert to its default style.\n   - This is a known limitation—OpenAI is actively trying to improve how well models retain and respect user preferences.\n\n3. **What can you do?**\n   - **Be explicit in your prompt:** Remind the model at the start of your session: “Please do not use section breaks (---) in your responses.” This increases compliance for that session.\n   - **Restate as needed:** If the model slips, gently remind it again.\n   - **Feedback button:** Use the thumbs-down (👎) button on responses that ignore your instructions, and specify why. This feedback does get reviewed and helps improve future behavior.\n   - **Shorter sessions:** Sometimes, models are better at sticking to instructions in shorter, focused conversations.\n\n4. **Are custom instructions and memory useless?**\n   - Not useless, but not perfect. They’re improving, but right now, they’re best for general preferences (tone, level of detail) rather than strict formatting enforcement.\n   - Memory is still being refined and may not always override the model’s ingrained habits.\n\n**In summary:**  \nYou’re experiencing a known limitation. Section breaks are a default style the model likes, and custom instructions may not always override it. Your feedback is important, and OpenAI is working on making these features more reliable.\n\nIf you’d like, I can avoid using section breaks in this conversation. Just let me know!",

          "response": "I understand how frustrating that can be. ChatGPT is designed to use your custom instructions, but it also balances them with various internal formatting and policy constraints. In some cases—especially as conversations grow longer or move between modes—it may revert to default formatting. A few things you can try:\n\n1. Put Your Formatting Preferences at the Start of Each Conversation:\n   • Begin the conversation with a short directive like “Please do not use section breaks or headings. Respond using plain paragraphs.”  \n   • Though it can feel redundant, repeating these preferences in each new conversation sometimes helps override default behaviors.\n\n2. Be Specific About What to Avoid:\n   • If you notice particular symbols or styles (e.g., “###” or “—”), make sure to mention them explicitly.  \n   • For example: “Please do not insert ‘###’ or ‘—’ anywhere in your reply.”\n\n3. Keep the Instructions Concise:\n   • The more concise and direct your instructions, the less they risk getting diluted or overridden later.  \n   • For instance: “Only use plain text paragraphs with standard line breaks. No headings, lists, or decorative symbols.”\n\n4. Check for Conflicting Instructions:\n   • Sometimes, your custom instructions might contain or imply something that ChatGPT interprets as permission to format in a certain way.  \n   • Make sure your instructions aren’t giving mixed signals—for example, one part saying “keep it simple,” and another mentioning any sort of “section,” “bullet points,” etc.\n\n5. Consider Timing and Context Length:\n   • Long conversations can lead to partial forgetting of early instructions due to how the model’s memory window works.  \n   • When a conversation is especially lengthy, you might see the model default back to typical styling. In such cases, restating your formatting request can help.\n\n6. Submit Feedback:\n   • If you consistently see the same issue, you can use the feedback feature in the interface. The developers monitor that feedback to improve how custom instructions are handled.\n\nWhile these steps don’t guarantee the model will never slip back into headings or section breaks (especially during complex or lengthy chats), they do tend to help reduce unwanted formatting. If you continue running into this problem, it may be a quirk that the development team still needs to refine. Hopefully these tips make your experience a bit smoother.",

Provide very clear and explicit instructions in your custom instructions, emphasizing that you do not want any section breaks or formatting to be added.\n\n2. See if there's an option or setting to disable automatic formatting or section breaks. The platform may have a feature to turn off this behavior.\n\n3. Reach out to the platform's support team and explain the issue you're facing. They may be able to provide guidance or make adjustments on their end to prevent the unwanted section breaks.\n\n4. As a workaround, you could try copying and pasting your conversation into a text editor or word processor, and then removing the section breaks manually.

Here’s some information and thoughts on both your questions:\n\nMy Base Configuration  \nI'm based on OpenAI’s GPT-4o model, which means I can understand and generate text, help with reasoning, explain concepts, and generate creative content. I don't have persistent memory of your past conversations (unless you provide context within a session), but I can use \"Custom Instructions\" to try to tailor my responses to your style and preferences within one conversation.\n\nSection Breaks Issue  \nYou’re not alone—many users have reported that GPT-4o sometimes adds section breaks (like --- or ***), even when asked not to. Here’s why this happens:\n\n- The model is trained on lots of examples where section breaks are used for formatting, so it can default to them, especially when responding to multi-part queries.\n- Custom Instructions are helpful, but not perfect. They influence my responses, but sometimes the underlying model behavior overrides them, particularly for formatting habits.\n- The same goes for memory: right now, memory and Custom Instructions are \"soft\" guides, not hard rules.\n\nWhat Can You Do?  \n- Remind me at the start of each session or message: “Please don't use section breaks in your replies.”\n- If I slip up, a gentle reminder usually helps for the rest of the conversation.\n- If you have feedback, use the thumbs-down or feedback option in your chat interface—OpenAI reviews these to help improve models.\n\nIn summary: Custom Instructions and memory are real, but they're not always strictly enforced—especially for deeply ingrained habits like section breaks. I’ll do my best to avoid them if you request that!\n\nLet me know how you'd like to proceed, and if you want me to avoid section breaks in this conversation.",

For example: “Please respond without adding section breaks or other extra formatting.”  \n• If you notice the undesired formatting creeping back in, gently remind the system about your formatting preference at the beginning or end of your text prompt.  \n• If possible, use a more structured request—like “Please respond in plain text, one paragraph only”—to encourage minimal formatting.\n\nEven with these steps, some formatting might still appear due to how the system is designed, but those tips often help reduce or eliminate extra breaks or headings.

Try rephrasing or repeating your request.”  \n     - “Custom instructions improve the AI’s responses but are not foolproof.”\n\n**Summary Statement for Players:**  \n“In this game, you’ll interact with advanced AI. Sometimes, it may format its responses in unexpected ways or forget your preferences. This reflects real-world AI limitations.

Does it forget old instructions over time? Are certain pieces of information “lost” when not recorded properly?  \n   • This can be woven into the narrative: maybe the AI is damaged, corrupt, or tampered with, explaining why the player can’t rely on it to follow certain commands flawlessly.  \n\n2) How to Give and Revisit Instructions.  \n   • If your game has a mechanic where the player inputs “custom instructions” (like ChatGPT instructions), let them know exactly how to use that interface. If it’s prone to resetting or ignoring their directives, give an in-world cause (e.g. a security system that overrides user inputs) so the frustration feels like part of the story.  \n   • Encourage players to keep manual notes or logs of important commands. That makes them feel more like detectives who must track everything themselves rather than relying on an uncooperative system.  \n\n3) Clue Tracking and Puzzle Solving.  \n   • Because memory may be unreliable, emphasize the detective work: collecting physical evidence, cross-referencing data, or scanning for anomalies.  \n   • Let players know up front that they should gather clues in a “case file” or “journal” so critical details aren’t lost if the in-game memory doesn’t hold onto them.  \n\n4) The Rules and Limitations of the World.  \n   • Mystery games thrive when players have a clear set of rules to work within. Outline those rules: how clues are revealed, how suspicion systems or detective logic works, and any constraints on what the AI can or cannot do.  \n   • If the game includes an unreliable narrator or illusions, that can explain inconsistencies—but it’s good to signal that to players, so they learn to question information sources.  \n\n5) Why the System Might “Ignore” Certain Inputs.  \n   • If the game’s AI or interface is glitching (mimicking your frustration with ChatGPT ignoring instructions), build it into the narrative: a corporate override, sabotage by a villain, or an experimental AI with partial autonomy. These plot devices give context to the memory or command failures.  \n   • This transforms what could be a frustrating quirk into a puzzle component: players must figure out how to circumvent the AI’s breakdowns or sabotage.  \n\nBy explaining these points, you not only align player expectations with the game’s design but also turn the struggle with “forgetful instructions” or “messed-up formatting” into a story element. In a mystery context, it’s an opportunity to heighten tension: you’re never sure if clues are lost, tampered with, or hidden by the manipulative forces within the game’s world. All of that can deepen immersion and make your mystery feel more engaging and authentic.",

For example, it might explain to players that the world itself is built around an AI or system with its own inherent habits—even if you try to override them, its “memory” or built‐in instructions force certain behaviors. In other words, those unwanted section breaks aren’t just formatting glitches; they’re part of the mysterious logic of the system. Here are a few ideas for what the game might reveal:\n\n1. The persistent section breaks signal that there’s an underlying code or “memory” that can’t easily be overwritten—suggesting that hidden instructions (or the AI’s own rules) are keys to understanding and progressing in the narrative.\n\n2. Custom instructions (or player-set preferences) might seem ignored because the system has its own agenda. The game could explain that while players try to alter the conversation flow, the AI is bound by deeper protocols that—if deciphered—will reveal important secrets or unlock new paths.\n\n3. This conflict between what the player wants (a clean conversation) and what the AI automatically does (inserting section breaks) might be portrayed as a reflection of the fragile balance between human intent and machine logic. The game could hint that learning to “speak the system’s language” is necessary to unlock the next phase of the mystery.\n\n4. Finally, the game might suggest that memory and custom instructions aren’t just optional features, but fundamental components of progression. For instance, players might eventually discover that retrieving or reconfiguring this embedded “memory” (the way the AI always resets to its default style) is essential to solve puzzles or access concealed information.\n\nIn summary, the mystery game should explain that these persistent formatting quirks are deliberate clues—manifestations of an AI with its own hidden protocols and memory that players must understand and work with to advance.",

If you want to present these insights to students in a conference module—especially one focusing on how to work productively with AI tools like ChatGPT-4o—here are some key points students should know:\n\n---\n\n**1. AI Formatting Isn’t Perfect**\n- AI models like ChatGPT often make formatting choices (like section breaks) that may not match your preferences.\n- Even if you specify preferences in custom instructions, the model may not always follow them consistently.\n\n**2. Custom Instructions and Memory: Useful but Limited**\n- **Custom Instructions:** These help personalize responses, but the model may not always adhere strictly to them, especially in complex or lengthy conversations.\n- **Memory (where available):** Memory is still evolving and may not always recall or prioritize your formatting requests.\n- Don’t expect “set it and forget it” behavior—reiteration may be required.\n\n**3. Communicate Clearly, but Prepare to Edit**\n- Be explicit about what you want (e.g., “Please do not include any section breaks or headings”).\n- Even so, always review and edit the output to fit your needs—think of AI as a first draft assistant, not a perfect formatter.\n\n**4. Give Feedback**\n- Most platforms have feedback tools. Use them to report persistent issues; this helps improve future versions.\n\n**5. Develop a Workflow**\n- Accept that AI-generated drafts often need post-processing.\n- Use search/replace or document formatting tools to quickly clean up unwanted elements.\n\n**6. Critical Thinking About AI Claims**\n- Understand that AI “memory” and “customization” are still being refined.\n- Approach claims about AI capabilities with healthy skepticism and verify through your own experience.\n\n**7. Advocate for Your Needs**\n- Share your feedback and needs with developers, especially in educational or professional settings.\n\n---\n\n**In summary for students:**  \nAI tools are powerful but imperfect. Formatting quirks like unwanted section breaks are common, and features like custom instructions and memory are helpful but not foolproof. Always review and edit AI output, and maintain realistic expectations about what current AI can and cannot do.\n\nLet me know if you’d like this information formatted as slides, a handout, or for inclusion in your presentation notes!",

Minor variations in the conversation or slight wording changes can lead the model to revert to default formatting or behaviors.\n\n• Iterative Refinement Is Common: AI tools often require multiple rounds of instruction. After seeing an undesired output (like unwanted section breaks), it’s good practice to restate or clarify the instructions in the same conversation turn or the next one.\n\n• Models Are Trained with Generic Styles: ChatGPT was trained on vast amounts of text that include headings, sections, and other formatting habits. Even when asked not to produce them, it may “default” to these patterns if the prompt context nudges it in that direction.\n\n• Noise vs. Signal in Custom Instructions: Custom instructions are a great way to set general preferences (e.g., always answer concisely, avoid certain styles), but they may not override real-time conversation cues. If your prompt includes a structure that implies headings or breaks, the model might adopt them anyway.\n\n• Best Practices for Presentations: In a classroom or conference setting, emphasizing that large language models can be cooperative but also somewhat unpredictable is essential. Show how you can re-prompt or correct the model. Emphasize that these are tools, not perfect assistants, and that they require human oversight.\n\n• Stay Aware of Ongoing Updates: As ChatGPT and other AI tools update, certain quirks (like unwanted formatting) might be patched or replaced by new ones. Keeping an eye on release notes or known issues can help anticipate changes.\n\nUltimately, students should know that while generative AI can be incredibly helpful, it still requires human control, iteration, and review. Explain that part of becoming an effective user of AI is learning how to guide it—and how to handle occasional glitches in formatting or styles that refuse to stay fixed.",

          "response": "When preparing your presentation module on custom instructions and memory in language models like GPT-4, here are some key points to convey to your students:\n\n1. Behavior vs. Instruction:  \n • Even when you explicitly instruct the model not to produce certain formatting (like section breaks), it may still inject them. This happens because the model has been trained on vast amounts of data where such formatting is common, and the learned “habits” may override or conflict with custom instructions.\n\n2. Limitations of Custom Instructions:  \n • Custom instructions are useful for influencing output but aren’t absolute. They work as a soft, guiding signal rather than an ironclad rule. If the model’s underlying training data or built-in heuristics suggest that section breaks improve readability, they might reappear.\n • The interface for custom instructions gives users some control, but it doesn't “rewrite” the internal priorities of the model. The model may “forget” or bypass parts of those instructions during longer conversations.\n\n3. Memory and Persistence in AI Models:  \n • Current sessions are contextually aware, meaning that the model remembers the conversation history within a session. However, once the session ends, the memory is discarded.\n • Custom instructions (when supported) might persist across sessions on the client side, but they’re combined with the model’s intrinsic patterns. Therefore, even if the instructions are repeated or manually reinforced, the model’s default tendencies can reassert themselves.\n\n4. Trade-offs in User Experience:  \n • The balance between following custom instructions and maintaining a coherent, well-structured reply can lead to conflicts. For example, the model might choose to include section breaks because it feels they help structure complex information, even if that contradicts user instructions.\n • When designing automated tools, slide decks, or interactive presentations, consider that manual post-processing—or even explicit commands at every turn—may be necessary to achieve the exact formatting you desire.\n\n5. Broader Implications for AI Literacy:  \n • It’s important for students to understand that AI “memory” and adherence to instructions aren’t like a typical computer program with fixed behavior. Instead, they’re the product of probability distributions shaped by training data and contextual cues.\n • This helps illustrate why debugging and fine-tuning language models can be challenging. Users must learn to work within these constraints and sometimes rely on external steps (like editing or formatting) to align the output with their expectations.\n\nIn summary, while custom instructions offer a powerful way to influence how language models behave, they aren’t foolproof. The interplay between pre-trained behaviors, session context, and user guidance creates constraints that students should be aware of when both using and developing applications that feature AI-generated content. Understanding these nuances not only sets realistic expectations but also highlights opportunities for improving user-AI interaction in future systems.",

If you’re writing about the history of section breaks in AI responses (or more generally, the use of formatting in digital communication tools) from the post-9/11 security era to now, here are some themes and points you might consider including:\n\n### 1. **Context of the Post-9/11 Era**\n- How increased digital communication and security concerns changed the way people and organizations formatted and structured documents and conversations.\n- The rise of standardized templates and clear sectioning in government and corporate documents for compliance, auditing, and clarity.\n\n### 2. **Evolution of Digital Communication Tools**\n- The transition from emails and early chat interfaces to more advanced document editors and AI assistants.\n- How tools like Microsoft Word, Google Docs, and messaging platforms began to encourage or automate section breaks for readability and organization.\n\n### 3. **AI and Automatic Formatting**\n- The introduction of formatting conventions in AI-generated responses to improve clarity, especially as AI began to summarize, analyze, and structure information.\n- Why LLMs (like GPT-4 and Gemini) default to sectioned responses: clarity, easy scanning, and alignment with professional communication standards.\n\n### 4. **User Experience and Customization**\n- The tension between AI’s built-in formatting (section breaks, bullet points, etc.) and users’ desire for more natural or customized output.\n- The limits of current custom instructions and memory features, and why AI sometimes reverts to “safe” defaults despite user preferences.\n\n### 5. **Security, Privacy, and Auditability**\n- How formatting and sectioning support audit trails, security reviews, and compliance—especially post-9/11, when tracking and structuring information became more critical.\n- The role of formatting in making digital communications more searchable and analyzable for security purposes.\n\n### 6. **Recent Trends (2020s)**\n- The ongoing debate about AI personalization vs. standardization: balancing user autonomy with broadly-applicable communication norms.\n- Improvements (or lack thereof) in AI’s ability to remember and honor formatting preferences over time.\n\n### 7. **Future Directions**\n- The potential for more adaptive and context-aware formatting from AI, truly honoring user instructions.\n- Possible reasons for current limitations: technical, ethical, or design choices.\n\n### Sources and Examples\n- Reference official guidelines from organizations (e.g., NIST, ISO, corporate style guides) about document formatting post-9/11.\n- Cite user complaints and feature requests from AI forums and feedback channels about section breaks.\n- Highlight examples from real AI outputs, showing persistent section breaks despite user requests.\n\n---\n\n**In summary:**  \nYour history could track the rise of sectioned formatting as a response to new security and organizational demands post-9/11, its adoption by AI models as a default for clarity, and the ongoing friction between system defaults and user customization.

Was this behavior present in earlier versions or did it begin with a specific update (e.g., GPT‑4’s rollout)?  \n • Provide a timeline that charts changes in behavior, noting any correlation with updates or policy shifts (even if anecdotal).\n\n2. The Nature of Custom Instruction Handling\n • Describe how you’ve tried to override these breaks using custom instructions. Point out that despite your explicit instructions, the system reintroduces them.  \n • Discuss possible reasons: for example, are these breaks a built‑in stylistic safeguard, a remnant of legacy coding, or a decision influenced by security protocols?\n\n3. The Connection to Security Policies\n • Explore the idea that some aspects of the assistant’s behavior may be rooted in evolving security norms since the post‑9/11 era.  \n • Delve into how security considerations (such as data sanitization, consistency protocols, or prevention of code injection) might have indirectly resulted in design choices like enforced formatting or section breaks.  \n • Discuss in your work how these security‑driven changes reflect broader shifts in tech culture after 9/11 (increased surveillance, cautious design philosophies, etc.).\n\n4. The Tension Between User Customization and System Defaults\n • Analyze the struggle between user-specified customization (your custom instructions) and the system’s default behavior.  \n • Consider asking or researching why some system defaults override user settings, and whether this might be by design to maintain a uniform output across diverse queries or due to other technical reasons.\n\n5. Broader Implications for AI Memory and Interface Design\n • Reflect on what this might suggest about AI memory and conversation history. Does the persistence of these breaks hint at a deeper, less flexible architecture designed for security and consistency?  \n • Connect your experience with broader debates: How much should a user be able to control the format versus having a stable, reliable style that—but maybe even at a cost of personal preference—ensures consistency?\n\n6. User Experience and Aesthetics vs. Functionality\n • Consider including a discussion on how aesthetic preferences (avoiding “stupid section breaks”) often clash with backend functional or security requirements.  \n • Analyze possible trade‑offs: reliability and consistency versus personalization and flexibility.\n\n7. Documentation and External Perspectives\n • If available, include citations or references from developer notes, release logs, or comments from community forums that might shed light on why these formatting choices were made.  \n • Consider interviewing or referencing opinions from other users (or even experts) who have noted similar behaviors.\n\n8. Speculative or Investigative Queries\n • End with open questions: For instance, is there a technical reason behind the overriding of custom instructions, or is this a conscious decision influenced by risk management strategies?  \n • You might speculate on potential future changes—how could user feedback drive a re‑evaluation of these design choices?\n\nIncluding these points should give your work a comprehensive historical and analytical framework. You’d not only trace a specific technical quirk but also situate it within larger narratives about security, user control, and interface design evolution in modern AI systems.\n\nFeel free to adapt these ideas to match the tone and depth of your analysis.

To address your questions directly:\n\n**1. Why does ChatGPT-4o keep adding section breaks even after you ask it not to?**\n- The model is designed to structure information for readability, often using section breaks, bolded headers, or bullet points. While it tries to adapt to your preferences, its “instinct” for clarity sometimes overrides specific requests, especially in complex or multi-part answers.\n\n**2. Are custom instructions and memory working as intended?**\n- Custom instructions let you tell the model how you’d like it to respond. However, they aren’t always perfectly obeyed—especially for formatting preferences. While OpenAI is improving memory and adherence to custom instructions, the model currently has limitations:\n  - **Custom instructions**: These are suggestions, not strict rules. The model may occasionally revert to its default formatting, especially after several exchanges or if the prompt triggers a “structured” response.\n  - **Memory**: If you’re in a single conversation, ChatGPT remembers context, but it does not have persistent, cross-session memory unless you’re in a beta test of that feature. Even then, formatting preferences are not always perfectly retained.\n\n**3. What can you do?**\n- Be explicit in your prompt: For each message, you can say, for example, “Please answer in plain paragraphs without section breaks or headers.” This increases the chance it will comply for that answer.\n- If you consistently dislike section breaks, you can give direct feedback to OpenAI via the thumbs-down button or official channels.\n- For persistent formatting preferences, there isn’t currently a guaranteed fix, but improvements are ongoing.\n\n**Summary:**  \nCustom instructions and memory are “in play,” but they aren’t perfect, especially around formatting. The model’s drive for readability sometimes overrides your preferences.

          "response": "I understand your frustration with unwanted formatting—especially if section breaks reappear despite custom instructions. Here’s some context that might help:\n\n1) How large language models handle formatting:  \n   • Under the hood, GPT-style models use multiple layers of instructions. Your custom instructions are important, but there are also persistent “system” instructions that can override or modify how the model responds.  \n   • Even if you explicitly request “no section breaks,” occasional formatting can still slip through because of how the model was trained to structure text and the existence of system-level rules.  \n\n2) Why custom instructions may not always “stick”:  \n   • Custom instructions generally guide the model, but do not guarantee perfect compliance. There could be default or fallback behaviors that reassert themselves if the model detects topic changes, starts new threads, or reverts to certain defaults.  \n   • If you see the behavior switch off temporarily and then creep back in, it may be that a certain type of prompt or system-level nudge is reactivating the default formatting style.\n\n3) How memory works:  \n   • GPT does not have long-term memory in the same sense a person does. It perceives and “remembers” context within the conversation but does not store new permanent preferences on its own.  \n   • However, the platform (e.g., ChatGPT) attempts to use your custom instructions and conversation history to maintain a consistent style. It is not foolproof, and sometimes the model’s training can overshadow your requests.\n\n4) Tips you might try:  \n   • Start each new conversation with a direct reminder if formatting is critical to you (e.g., “Please do not insert any extra blank lines or section headers in your response.”).  \n   • Keep instructions very short and direct—sometimes too much explanation can confuse the model.  \n   • If section breaks appear again, issue a short follow-up command. Many users find repeating the precise instruction again can help.\n\nNow, to the broader question: “For a futuristic scenario involving the autonomous-systems era, what role might instructions and memory play?”  \n\n• Human–AI Interaction:  \n  As autonomous systems advance—self-driving cars, AI-powered factories, drone deliveries, etc.—humans will need efficient ways to instruct and guide them. Clear, consistent instructions become crucial.  \n\n• Custom Instructions for Adaptability:  \n  Organizations will want to encode house rules, ethical guidelines, and mission objectives into AI systems. Custom instructions serve as a quick way to align an AI’s behavior with localized needs—think of in-home service robots that adapt to your family norms, or corporate AIs that must follow company policy.  \n\n• Memory for Personalized Services:  \n  Personalization will become even more relevant as autonomous systems do complex tasks. They need to retain context—your preferences, habits, constraints—so they don’t have to be retrained from scratch every time. This memory, however, will need to respect privacy and security, balancing personalization with safety.  \n\n• System vs. User Instructions:  \n  In highly automated futures, “system instructions” (governed by regulators, laws, and fundamental constraints) may override user-level commands to ensure compliance. For instance, an autonomous vehicle is legally bound to follow traffic laws no matter what a passenger says.  \n\n• Override and Fail-Safes:  \n  Safety-critical systems must have robust “fail-safe” instructions to override any attempt that conflicts with safety or regulation. Memory and instructions at multiple levels (manufacturer, regulatory, user) will exist in a carefully layered hierarchy.  \n\nIn summary, in a future dominated by autonomous systems, instructions (both custom and system-level) and memory (contextual awareness, personalization) play fundamental roles—helping AI systems remain useful, aligned with human values, and adaptable to individual or organizational needs.  \n\nI hope this clarifies both why undesired section breaks might creep back in and how instructions and memory could shape our future with autonomous systems.

          "response": "It sounds like you’re highlighting a couple of issues at once. On one hand, you’re wondering about the future role of things like custom instructions and memory when we imagine an era of highly autonomous systems. On the other hand, you’re frustrated by a recurring formatting behavior (those “section breaks”) that persists despite your repeated instructions.\n\nLet’s break this down:\n\n1. Future Role of Custom Instructions and Memory in Autonomous Systems\n\nIn a future where autonomous systems run much of our day‐to‐day tasks, robust and adaptive features like custom instructions and memory are expected to be central. Imagine an AI that not only comprehends your commands but adapts continuously to your style, preferences, and context without you having to repeat yourself. This would mean:\n • Highly personalized interactions that evolve with your needs.\n • Persistent context that isn’t limited to a single session, allowing for deeper collaboration.\n • An ability to override default behaviors (such as standardized formatting) in a way that feels consistent and reliable.\n\nIn such a scenario, the capacity for an AI to “remember” your preferences (or learn from them over time) could improve efficiency and intuitiveness. But achieving that reliability is a complex challenge: the system’s architecture must seamlessly balance standardization (so that responses are clear and structured) with personalized customizations. In essence, the autonomous systems of the future should ideally allow your instructions to be deeply integrated into the AI’s operational model, so quirks like unwanted section breaks wouldn’t keep reappearing.\n\n2. The Frustration with Recurrent Formatting Issues\n\nThe issue you described—where GPT-4 (or “4o” as you put it) continues to insert section breaks despite your instructions otherwise—is an example of the kind of tension that can exist between default system behaviors and user customizations. There are a few possible reasons for this:\n • Built-in formatting protocols: The system may be designed to introduce section breaks or structured formatting to enhance readability or adhere to guidelines set by developers.\n • Memory versus processing design: Although custom instructions are part of the user personalization layer, they sometimes compete with other layers of the prompt-processing system. In some cases, even if you update your instructions, the underlying model might revert to “safer” default patterns.\n • Limitations in persistent memory: Nowadays, the memory of these models isn’t as fluid or as persistent as the human mind—it might not always “remember” every nuance of your instruction if it conflicts with standard practices coded into the system.\n\n3. Is Custom Instruction and Memory “a Play”?\n\nYour observation—that it seems like custom instructions and memory might be playing a role (or not really working as expected)—touches on an important point. The promise of a truly adaptive assistant is still evolving. In our current models, customizations exist and can be powerful, but they aren’t always bulletproof. Developers work continuously on improving the balance, but sometimes inherent design constraints or fallback behaviors (meant to maintain clarity and safety) will override user preferences, leading to behaviors like the recurring section breaks.\n\nIn summary, in a futuristic autonomous systems era, the ideal is for custom instructions and memory to be deeply integrated and responsive to each individual’s needs. Today’s systems are stepping stones toward that goal. Your experience with persistent formatting shows that while significant progress has been made, there remains a gap between the promise of dynamic, personalized AI interactions and the reality of built-in defaults designed to maintain structure. Your feedback is valuable—it’s exactly the kind of insight that helps developers understand where these systems need to improve.\n\nDoes this help clarify both the futuristic vision and some of the realities you’re facing today?",

Hypothetically, if someone is experiencing an issue where GPT-4o (or another large language model) keeps inserting section breaks (like --- or ### etc.) despite repeated requests not to, and even after updating custom instructions and memory, here’s a theoretical approach to understanding and addressing the problem:\n\n## Theoretical Approach\n\n### 1. **Model Behavior Analysis**\n- **Default Formatting:** Many LLMs (including GPT-4o) are trained on data with common formatting conventions (like section breaks for clarity). These may be \"baked in\" as preferred ways to organize output.\n- **Instruction Compliance:** While models try to follow user instructions, they may default to learned behaviors, especially if the instructions are not reinforced every time.\n\n### 2. **Custom Instructions Limitations**\n- **Granularity:** Custom instructions generally guide the model’s overall behavior, but do not fully override all learned patterns.\n- **Context Window:** The model's adherence to instructions may degrade over longer conversations as earlier context is dropped or forgotten.\n- **Prompt Primacy:** The most recent prompt (your latest message) often has the most influence; custom instructions may be \"outweighed\" unless the request is restated.\n\n### 3. **Memory and System Limitations**\n- **Memory Scope:** Current memory systems in LLMs are often session- or thread-based and not perfect. They may not retain every detail as expected.\n- **Feature Maturity:** Custom instructions and memory features are evolving and may not yet have robust mechanisms for enforcing persistent formatting preferences.\n\n### 4. **Possible Workarounds (Theoretically)**\n- **Explicit, Frequent Reminders:** Start each conversation or prompt with \"Do not use section breaks or horizontal lines in your responses.\"\n- **Negative Prompting:** Use prompts like \"Respond in a continuous paragraph without any section breaks or formatting lines.\"\n- **Custom Output Templates:** If available, define a \"template\" for responses that omits unwanted formatting.\n- **Feedback Loop:** After each response, provide corrective feedback if the model lapses, reinforcing the desired style.\n\n### 5. **Technical Solutions (Future or Advanced)**\n- **Fine-Tuning:** In theory, fine-tuning a model on examples without section breaks would help, but this isn’t available to most end users.\n- **API Post-processing:** If using the API, programmatically remove unwanted formatting from the model’s output before displaying it.\n\n### 6. **Product Feedback**\n- **Report Bugs:** If the feature is not adhering to instructions, providing feedback to the developers helps improve future versions.\n\n## Summary (Hypothetically)\n- The persistence of section breaks likely results from deep-seated formatting habits in the model's training.\n- Custom instructions and memory are helpful but not absolute overrides.\n- Repeated, explicit prompting and feedback may help, but technical or product-level solutions might ultimately be required.\n\nIf you want, I can suggest example prompts or further technical strategies!",

          "response": "From a purely theoretical perspective, there are a few reasons an AI system might seem to ignore or override a user’s custom instructions—particularly around formatting preferences like avoiding certain types of breaks or spacing. Here are a few considerations:\n\n1) Hierarchy of Instructions  \n• Many large language models adopt a tiered approach to instructions: there may be “system-level” or “developer-level” directives that take precedence over user-provided instructions.  \n• Even if you provide custom instructions, the system’s baseline formatting behaviors might come from these higher-level directives.  \n\n2) Model Defaults vs. User Overrides  \n• Language models are trained on massive corpora, in which certain formatting styles (such as section or paragraph breaks) are extremely common.  \n• If the model has learned that “conversational” text often has natural breaks or if it has some default code snippet for recapping or clarifying, it could have a tendency to revert to those patterns.  \n• The custom instructions may only offer mild guidance; if they conflict with strong internal patterns or reinforced behaviors, the model might revert.\n\n3) Context Window and Memory Constraints  \n• Memory in large language models is typically contextual, based on the immediate conversation window. Even if you repeatedly specify not to insert certain breaks, that directive could be lost or deprioritized if the prompt drifts away from it or if the conversation gets too long.  \n• “Long-term memory” features (like custom instructions) might still compete with the present context and overarching model behaviors.  \n\n4) Model Uncertainty and Conflicting Signals  \n• When the model encounters conflicting signals (e.g., a user says “No breaks,” but the default system prompt or its own training suggests “Insert breaks”), it may alternate responses. Early replies could follow your instructions until some trigger (like a new conversation context or a standard fallback pattern) nudges it to resume its usual formatting.  \n\n5) Incomplete or Implicit Instructions  \n• It’s possible that your instructions address only part of the model’s formatting behavior. For instance, you might say, “Don’t put section breaks,” but if the model is using another script or rule set (like bulleting or headings) that also inserts natural spacing, it might interpret them as a different requirement.  \n\nTHINGS YOU COULD THEORETICALLY TRY:  \n• Provide your “no-break” instruction very explicitly in each prompt—almost “front-load” it, so the model sees it every time (though this can be inconvenient).  \n• Experiment with a single prompt that instructs the format meticulously: “Please keep all responses in one continuous paragraph with no blank lines or headings.”  \n• If technically possible in your interface, examine whether built-in system prompts or developer instructions can be modified (though many interfaces do not allow user-level changes at that depth).\n\nIn summary, if you repeatedly find that custom instructions or memory features feel ineffectual, the likely cause is that higher-level defaults or learned patterns take priority whenever there’s a conflict. This is not necessarily because those custom instructions “don’t work” at all, but because they might have less weight than core rules embedded in the model’s design or its initial system prompts.",

          "response": "I’m interpreting your question as a hypothetical exploration into how one might design a system that obeys higher-level, persistent user preferences (like “no section breaks”) while still incorporating default or system-specified behaviors. In theory, one could approach this problem by considering a layered instruction model:\n\n1. Layer Prioritization:  \n • At the highest level, you’d have hard-coded system instructions (set by the developers) that define core behaviors and formatting styles.  \n • Next would come persistent user settings or “custom instructions” that are intended to modify or supplement the system defaults.  \n • Finally, you have the real-time instructions given in each conversation turn.  \nThe challenge is managing the conflict when user instructions (e.g., “don’t use section breaks”) clash with a lower-level default behavior that still produces them. A theoretical solution might force the hierarchy so that user customizations override default formatting in all output.\n\n2. Persistent Context and Memory:  \n • The system’s “memory” can be modeled as the context that persists through a conversation session. However, if the system is designed so that certain formatting is inserted at a lower level (for instance, by default templating in the generation pipeline), then even repeated user instructions might not permanently change that behavior unless the underlying generation process is modified.  \n • To fix this, one might design the memory module to “remember” a user’s preferences over sessions. This means that “custom instructions” are stored persistently and applied at generation time every time, rather than being side‐noted in the conversation context.  \n • In a more interactive architecture, one could imagine plugging in a middleware that intercepts the generated text and strips out unwanted formatting (like extra section breaks) before delivering the final answer. That would be more of a post-processing approach rather than something the core model would learn.\n\n3. Adaptive Prompt Engineering:  \n • Another theoretical approach is to leverage dynamic, adaptive prompt injection. The system could detect when it’s about to insert undesired formatting and adjust the prompt on the fly. For example, if a section break is about to be introduced, the system checks the “user’s custom instructions” context flag and overrides that decision in real time.  \n • This would require the model not just to “remember” the custom instruction but also to actively enforce it throughout the generation process.\n\n4. Model Fine-Tuning and Reinforcement Learning:  \n • In a more foundational approach, one could fine-tune the model with additional training examples that demonstrate the user’s desired format (i.e., no section breaks). This might involve reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) where the model is rewarded for maintaining the requested format consistently.  \n • In theory, if the model has seen enough examples during fine-tuning that “no section breaks” is the norm, it might naturally avoid reintroducing them even if its internal default behavior is otherwise.\n\nIn summary, the theoretical approach to resolving such conflicts between system defaults and user customizations would likely involve structuring the instructions hierarchically, ensuring persistent storage and enforcement of user preferences (possibly through both pre- and post-processing), and potentially fine-tuning the model to adopt the desired behavior as a default. This layered, adaptive strategy would give priority to user preferences while still harnessing the underlying model’s capabilities.",

To approach this theoretically, one might:\n\n1. **Assess Prompt and Instruction Clarity:**  \n   Ensure that the instructions in the custom instructions are clear, unambiguous, and consistently phrased. The model's interpretation can vary with subtle wording changes.\n\n2. **Token Context Limitations:**  \n   Hypothetically, the AI may not be consistently referencing custom instructions due to token limits or context-window constraints. This would theoretically mean that, after a certain point in the conversation, the custom instructions may fade in priority or become omitted entirely.\n\n3. **Instruction Priority and Hierarchy:**  \n   Theoretically, there may be internal prioritization structures or default formatting patterns that override custom instructions. A solution would involve explicitly reinforcing instructions regularly within the conversation to maintain priority.\n\n4. **Fine-tuning or System-level Constraints:**  \n   The model's behavior might be theoretically guided by fine-tuning or system-level defaults that can override user-provided instructions over time. If so, resolving this theoretically would involve adjustments at the system or platform level, beyond user control.\n\n5. **Model Limitations:**  \n   Theoretically, the AI might have inherent limitations in consistently applying instructions across longer interactions, highlighting the need for improved instruction-following capabilities or a more stable memory mechanism.\n\nIn sum, a theoretical approach would involve systematically clarifying instructions, evaluating token-context limits, examining instruction prioritization, and potentially revisiting the model's underlying design to ensure long-term consistency and adherence to user instructions.",

User Experience Consistency is Critical**  \n- Persistent issues (like unwanted section breaks) undermine user trust.\n- Consistency in following user preferences (via custom instructions/memory) is essential for productivity tools.\n\n**2. Limitations of AI ‘Memory’ and Customization**  \n- Current AI models may not reliably retain or implement user-specific instructions across sessions or conversations.\n- There’s a gap between advertised ‘memory’ features and real-world performance.\n\n**3. User Feedback Loops Matter**  \n- When users repeatedly give feedback or set preferences and the system ignores them, frustration grows.\n- Effective products should have mechanisms to learn from and adapt to user corrections.\n\n**4. Impact on Adoption and Brand Perception**  \n- Small usability issues, when repeated, can significantly affect willingness to adopt or recommend a product.\n- Features that don’t function as promised can damage brand trust.\n\n**5. Importance of Transparent Communication**  \n- If there are known limitations, communicating them clearly helps manage expectations.\n- Users appreciate honesty about what a system can and cannot do.\n\n**6. Opportunities for Product Improvement**  \n- There’s a clear market need for more robust memory/customization in AI assistants.\n- User pain points present valuable opportunities for iterative product development.\n\n**Summary Insight:**  \nThe case highlights the gap between user expectations and actual AI capabilities, especially with ‘memory’ features.

When a product claims customizable settings (like “no section breaks”), users expect it to follow those instructions across all interactions—otherwise, faith in the tool’s reliability can erode.\n\n2) Clarity about Customization Boundaries:  \n   • Custom instructions or settings that do not reliably stick breed confusion and undermine the perceived value of personalization features.  \n   • Clear documentation or user guidance about potential limitations (“Some formatting might still occur under certain conditions…”) can manage user expectations and guide them more effectively.\n\n3) Importance of Feedback Loops and Iteration:  \n   • The user’s repeated attempt to fix the problem (by updating custom instructions) signals valuable feedback about specific product shortcomings.  \n   • A straightforward mechanism to report persistent issues—and to confirm that user concerns are being addressed—fosters customer loyalty and continuous product improvement.\n\n4) Technical Constraints and Transparency:  \n   • Despite robust technology, certain AI or application constraints (such as default formatting behavior) may remain difficult to override.  \n   • Transparent communication around these constraints can help users understand why an issue persists and what workarounds may exist.\n\n5) Maintaining Trust and Managing Frustration:  \n   • When users perceive that their direct input (custom instructions) is ignored or overridden, they may become skeptical about the tool’s capabilities.  \n   • Rapid, open responses—acknowledging user frustrations and actively working toward a fix—help protect brand trust and user satisfaction.\n\n6) Continuous Improvement Through Testing:  \n   • The recurring nature of the “section breaks” bug underscores the need for vigilant regression testing whenever new features (like custom instructions) are introduced.  \n   • Ongoing A/B testing and user feedback loops help surface these issues before they become widespread pain points.\n\nIn a business context, these lessons highlight the necessity of delivering on promised customizations, engaging transparently with user feedback, and maintaining an iterative development process that proactively identifies and resolves issues. By effectively managing both the product’s technical aspects and the communication around them, an organization can retain user trust and improve overall user satisfaction.",

Default Behaviors Are Hard to Override  \n Even when you specify “no section breaks” in both your custom instructions and during the conversation, the model may revert to its built‐in formatting patterns. This shows that certain default behaviors in design can be difficult to change completely.\n\n2. Custom Instructions Aren’t Absolute Memory  \n The fact that your custom instructions don’t always hold steady demonstrates that the system’s “memory” of those instructions is not like human memory. The model often operates based on its core behavior patterns unless repeatedly and explicitly guided otherwise.\n\n3. System Design Versus User Intent  \n Although you clearly indicated your preference, the model might “think” that structured formatting (like section breaks) helps clarity or organization. This reflects an underlying design decision that doesn’t always account for specific user preferences.\n\n4. Need for Repeated Clarification  \n Your experience suggests that you might need to reinforce your formatting instructions multiple times throughout a conversation to counteract the model’s default settings. This is a notable insight into how instruction reinforcement might be necessary for fine-tuning outputs.\n\n5. Limits of Personalization  \n Even with repeated instructions and customization, you might bump up against limits in how personalized the outputs can be. This shows there’s a balance between adapting to specific user instructions and maintaining the model’s inherent style and structure.\n\n6. Implications for Business Case Studies  \n For a business case study, these observations underline the importance of understanding both the strengths and limitations of AI assistants. When you rely on them for consistent output, you must remain aware that certain formatting choices might persist beyond your initial intent.\n\nUltimately, your learning points include recognizing the persistence of built-in formatting defaults, the challenge in altering them via custom instructions, and the need for continuous reinforcement if you truly want to deviate from what the model typically produces.",

          "response": "Deciding on the most suitable theoretical foundation depends on how you plan to frame the core question of your dissertation: Is it about human–AI interaction design, about the cognitive processes (or seeming lack thereof) in large language models, or about the social/technological implications of AI systems that fail to follow user instructions consistently? Below are a few theoretical perspectives that could serve as strong foundations, along with why they might be relevant:\n\n1) Situated Action / Ethnomethodology (Lucy Suchman)  \n   • Focus: Examines how humans (and, by analogy, conversational agents) respond in real-time to local contexts rather than following static rules.  \n   • Relevance: If your central issue is that large language models do not reliably follow the “script” (your instructions), a situated action perspective can help you analyze how AI outputs are constructed “on the fly,” influenced by conversation context rather than purely by pre-existing rules.  \n   • Why it helps: It frames the unpredictability of AI outputs as an emergent phenomenon shaped by context, which speaks directly to your struggles with instructions that seem to vanish.\n\n2) Distributed Cognition (Edwin Hutchins)  \n   • Focus: Considers how cognitive processes are not confined to an individual mind, but distributed across people, artifacts, and environments.  \n   • Relevance: Large language models rely on massive external “memory” (training data and prompt context). If your research emphasizes how user instructions are not retained or get overshadowed by the model’s training data, you can analyze this through the lens of distributed cognition—where the “cognitive system” includes the user, the model, and the interface together.  \n   • Why it helps: Provides a systematic way to examine where breakdowns in “shared memory” or instructions occur.\n\n3) Activity Theory (Yrjö Engeström and others)  \n   • Focus: Views human (or in this case, human–AI) activity as part of a complex system, shaped by motives, tools, community rules, and division of labor.  \n   • Relevance: AI chat systems often operate within a broader network: your institutional context (the system you’re using, the rules or norms about instructions), the design of the tool, and your own objectives.  \n   • Why it helps: It identifies contradictions and tensions (e.g., your instructions vs. the AI’s design constraints) as drivers of system change or user frustration.\n\n4) Social Construction of Technology (SCOT)  \n   • Focus: Examines how technologies are shaped by the social groups that use and design them, leading to interpretive flexibility.  \n   • Relevance: If your interest is in how the AI’s behavior reflects or conflicts with user expectations (“I’ve told it not to do X, yet it still does!”), SCOT can help explain how design choices and user feedback loops produce a technology that only partially aligns with user demands.  \n   • Why it helps: Offers a sociological lens on the mismatch between user instructions and the eventual technical functioning.\n\n5) Human–Computer Interaction (HCI) Theories (e.g., Norman’s Conceptual Models)  \n   • Focus: Explains how people form mental models of how a system should work, and how design influences their expectations.  \n   • Relevance: If you are highlighting user frustration (you give explicit instructions, yet the AI breaks them), an HCI approach can help you show how the mismatch between your “mental model” and the actual system model leads to repeated breakdowns.  \n   • Why it helps: Provides frameworks to systematically analyze user experience and feed these findings back into design recommendations.\n\n6) Actor–Network Theory (Bruno Latour, Michel Callon)  \n   • Focus: Treats humans and non-humans (like AI systems) as interconnected “actors” in a network of translation and negotiation.  \n   • Relevance: When an AI “ignores” your custom instructions, you can view that as a failure in the network of relationships between you (the user), the AI system’s training data, the platform’s memory architecture, and so on.  \n   • Why it helps: Makes visible all the intermediaries (algorithms, data, UI, your institution’s demands) that shape how instructions are received or lost.\n\nChoosing Among These Approaches:  \n• If you’re drawn to a cognitive framing (i.e., how “memory” works or fails in AI), you might lean toward Distributed Cognition or Activity Theory.  \n• If you want to emphasize social context and user expectations, Social Construction of Technology or Actor–Network Theory can help you capture how instructions get “constructed” (or “ignored”).  \n• If your focus is on pragmatic user–AI design and the frustration that arises when the system deviates from user instructions, an HCI lens may be most directly applicable.\n\nUltimately, pick the framework(s) that best match how you want to tell your dissertation’s story. If your research will be qualitative, focusing on user experiences and the emergent nature of AI conversations, ethnomethodology or Activity Theory might be strongest. If it will be more about design recommendations (how to fix or improve prompt adherence), HCI models may be more pragmatic. You can also combine approaches if you need both a sociotechnical and a cognitive perspective.\n\nIn summary, there is no single “correct” framework, but rather different theoretical toolkits that highlight different facets of the same problem: the apparent push-and-pull between user instructions and the AI’s own conversation-shaping processes. By grounding your dissertation solidly in one (or a mix) of these theories, you can anchor your empirical findings and give them a strong intellectual underpinning.",

          "response": "Below is one way to think about it. Your issue—that custom instructions seem to “fail” to override built‐in defaults (like the recurring section breaks) even after you explicitly request otherwise—points us toward a broader, systemic look at how AI “memory” and instruction following are designed and executed. In other words, it’s not just a momentary glitch or user error; it invites us to ask about the underlying architectures and institutional biases embedded within these systems.\n\nOne useful theoretical approach is a sociotechnical one that treats the AI as a networked actor. For example, you might consider:\n\n1. Actor–Network Theory (ANT): Originally from science and technology studies, ANT encourages us to look at systems (including AI) as assemblages where both human actors (you, developers, end‐users) and nonhuman actors (the built‐in defaults, memory parameters, and custom instructions modules) interact. This approach lets you examine how preconfigured behavior (like automatic section breaks) “persists” through a network of technical, institutional, and design factors even when users try to change it.\n\n2. Distributed Cognition: This theory, from cognitive science and HCI, suggests that cognition isn’t confined solely to an individual but is spread out across people, artifacts, and environments. In your case, you could analyze how “memory” and “instruction” exist partly in the design of the system (for example, its training, reinforcement learning, and the default behaviors encoded into the model) as well as in the ongoing interactions between you and the AI. It gives a framework to understand why certain patterns re-emerge despite custom instructions because they are “distributed” in the technical and design architecture.\n\n3. Human–Computer Interaction (HCI) & Interface Design Theories: Within HCI, issues like the “principle of least astonishment” or “automation bias” are relevant. How do users expect the system to behave versus how it actually behaves? What design practices lead to system defaults overriding users’ attempts to customize behavior? Research in this area can offer both theoretical grounding and practical insights into the constraints and affordances of conversational AI.\n\nTo tie these threads together, your dissertation could propose that the seemingly “sticky” defaults (the recurring section breaks) are an emergent property of the sociotechnical design of modern generative AI systems. By orienting your analysis with theories like ANT and Distributed Cognition, you’d be able to argue that the AI is not simply a passive tool that takes orders but a complex, networked system where the interplay of memory (contextual and long‐term) and preconfigured responses often reasserts itself despite user modifications.\n\nIn summary, a combination of Actor–Network Theory and Distributed Cognition, enriched with insights from HCI and interface design theories, would provide a robust theoretical foundation for exploring how and why custom instructions “fail” to dislodge default behaviors in conversational AI systems. This framework lets you examine both the technical design choices (e.g., training data, reinforcement learning, architectural constraints) and the human factors (expectations, user interactions, the negotiation between designers' defaults and users' custom instructions) contributing to the phenomenon you’re observing.\n\nThis blend not only grounds your work in established theoretical frameworks but also opens up avenues to discuss broader questions—how do we design collaborative systems where user agency is respected, and where do we draw the line between system “memory” and user control?",

          "response": "It sounds like you are dealing with a stubborn interface problem that's highlighting broader theoretical concerns about human-AI interaction, AI memory limitations, and user expectations versus system behavior. Given your topic, your experience might serve as a useful illustration of a deeper theoretical issue. Here are some theoretical frameworks and foundations you might consider using in your dissertation proposal:\n\n### 1. **Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) Theory**\n- **Norman's Theory of Affordances (Donald Norman)**:  \n  Your frustration reflects a mismatch between your expectations as a user (\"affordances\" you expect the AI to have) and the actual affordances provided by the AI. Norman’s theory can help you frame your experience in terms of expectation gaps and design flaws.\n- **Gulf of Execution and Gulf of Evaluation (Norman & Hutchins)**:  \n  The persistent failure of ChatGPT to respond appropriately to your explicit instructions highlights a wide gulf between user intention and system execution, as well as between system state and user evaluation.\n\n### 2. **Mental Models and User Expectations**\n- **Mental Models (Gentner & Stevens; Johnson-Laird)**:  \n  Users build mental representations of how systems should behave based on their previous experiences. Your repeated frustration suggests your mental model of ChatGPT’s memory and custom instruction capabilities is mismatched with reality. This framework can help you examine why users (like yourself) expect certain behaviors and how interfaces might better align user expectations with system functionality.\n\n### 3. **Technology Acceptance Model (TAM)**\n- **Davis's TAM (Technology Acceptance Model)**:  \n  TAM examines how perceived usefulness and ease of use influence adoption of technology. If the AI repeatedly ignores your instructions, perceived ease of use and usefulness decline considerably, potentially undermining user trust and adoption. This perspective can help you frame the importance of consistent and predictable system behavior.\n\n### 4. **Distributed Cognition**\n- **Distributed Cognition Theory (Hutchins)**:  \n  Distributed cognition views interactions between humans and technology as joint cognitive systems. The persistent mismatch between your instructions and GPT’s outputs shows a breakdown in cognitive distribution—your cognitive expectations aren’t supported by the machine’s cognitive capabilities.\n\n### 5. **Expectation Violation Theory (EVT)**\n- **Burgoon's Expectancy Violations Theory**:  \n  EVT examines how individuals respond when their expectations are violated, either positively or negatively. Your repeated frustration reflects negative expectancy violation—making EVT useful for analyzing user dissatisfaction and its impacts on trust and continued usage.\n\n### 6. **Activity Theory**\n- **Engeström’s Activity Theory**:  \n  Activity theory examines how people mediate their interactions and tasks through tools. The repeated breakdown you're experiencing can be viewed as a disruption in the mediated activity of dissertation writing—highlighting potential disconnects between intended and actual tool functionality.\n\n### 7. **Memory and Attention Constraints in AI Systems**\n- **Cognitive Load Theory (Sweller)**:  \n  Can be applied metaphorically to AI assistants, addressing how the AI’s limited memory (token constraints and context windows) may cause performance degradation, even when explicitly instructed otherwise.\n\n---\n\n### Recommendation:\n\nGiven your specific frustration, I would strongly recommend using one or a combination of the following:\n\n- **Mental Models and Expectation Violation Theory**, as your scenario explicitly highlights gaps between what you expect the AI to remember (given custom instructions) and how the AI actually behaves.\n- **Distributed Cognition or Activity Theory** if you wish to emphasize the systemic breakdown between human expectation and machine capability in collaborative tasks.\n\nUltimately, framing your dissertation around these theoretical foundations could provide valuable insights into the broader implications of AI-user interactions, memory limitations, and user trust and satisfaction.",

Understand the Role and Limitations of AI Memory  \n • Examine how ChatGPT’s “memory” (context retention across a session) interacts with custom instructions and predetermined formatting.  \n • Explore why certain formatting choices “come back” even when explicitly requested not to, and what that implies about the system’s design.\n\n3. Analyze the Interaction Between User Customizations and System Priorities  \n • Discuss how custom instructions are integrated with underlying system guidelines.  \n • Evaluate scenarios in which user customizations are overridden either partially or fully by preset behaviors.\n\n4. Develop Strategies for Effective Communication with AI  \n • Learn techniques for framing instructions to best influence the AI’s behavior, understanding that some defaults may require alternative approaches.  \n • Identify potential workarounds or adjustments that might help mitigate undesired recurring formatting issues.\n\n5. Explore Broader Implications for AI Interaction Design  \n • Consider how these challenges affect the user experience and inform design decisions in AI systems.  \n • Reflect on the balance between user control and the robustness of default system prompts or behaviors.\n\n6. Encourage Critical Reflection on Customization in AI Tools  \n • Facilitate discussions on potential improvements or enhancements for future iterations of AI interfaces.  \n • Promote hands-on trials where participants modify instructions and observe differences, fostering an iterative learning process about AI customization.\n\nThese outcomes would help participants better understand not only the specific behavior around section breaks and custom instructions but also broader principles of interacting with and designing for AI systems with dynamic behavior.",

How are custom instructions and memory prioritized in the model’s output?**\n   - Are custom instructions always enforced, or are there contexts where the model ignores or overrides them?\n   - Is there a hierarchy or conflict resolution method between user instructions and system defaults?\n\n**2. Is there a technical limitation or known issue with formatting controls?**\n   - Have other users reported similar problems with section breaks or ignored formatting instructions?\n   - Are there planned updates to improve adherence to user-specified formatting?\n\n**3. What’s the best way to communicate formatting preferences?**\n   - Is there a specific syntax, phrasing, or location (prompt vs. custom instructions) that’s more effective for persistent formatting control?\n   - Are some instructions more likely to be respected when given at the start of each session/conversation?\n\n**4. How can we receive feedback or confirmation that custom instructions are being applied?**\n   - Is there a way to check which instructions or memory items are “active” in a given conversation?\n   - Can the model confirm, at the start of each session, which instructions it is following?\n\n**5. Are there workarounds or API-level controls for formatting?**\n   - Is it possible to set formatting at the API or system level for your organization, rather than relying on per-conversation instructions?\n   - Are there templates or plugins that enforce formatting rules?\n\n**6. What is the expected roadmap for improved instruction adherence?**\n   - Are there plans to make custom instructions and memory more robust and persistent, especially for enterprise or policy development use?\n\n**Summary Suggestion:**\nYou might want to frame your inquiry to the developers/support team like this:\n\n> \"We’re experiencing persistent issues with unwanted section breaks in outputs, even after specifying preferences in both conversation and custom instructions.

          "response": "Here are a few routes you could consider when troubleshooting ChatGPT’s unwanted “section breaks”—and ideas on what questions you might ask along the way:\n\n1. Clarify and Simplify Your Custom Instructions\n   • Sometimes less is more. If your custom instructions are long or contain multiple directives, ChatGPT could be getting hung up and ignoring parts of them. \n   • What to ask:  \n     – “Am I over-specifying how tasks should be done, causing potential confusion?”  \n     – “Would simplifying my custom instructions help ChatGPT adhere more consistently?”\n\n2. Check for Potential Overwriting by System Instructions\n   • ChatGPT also follows system-level instructions (the ones you typically cannot see or change). If there’s a default formatting expectation baked into those system instructions, it might override your personal settings. \n   • What to ask:  \n     – “How are the hidden system instructions impacting my custom instructions?”  \n     – “Is there a recommended way to override or reconcile system formatting preferences?”\n\n3. Reassert Instructions in the Conversation\n   • Even with custom instructions in place, if the model misbehaves (e.g., keeps creating section breaks), sometimes explicitly reasserting your instructions in the conversation can help. \n   • What to ask:  \n     – “What is the best language or phrasing to use in my prompt so that ChatGPT does not insert section breaks?”  \n     – “Would using a short, direct statement like ‘Please do not insert any blank lines or section dividers in your response’ help?”\n\n4. Experiment with Format and Content\n   • Sometimes, ironically, using bullet points or numbered lists can reduce the chance of extra blank lines—though it can also encourage them. There’s no harm in running a few small-scale tests. \n   • What to ask:  \n     – “Does a plain text request yield fewer formatting artifacts than using bullet points?”  \n     – “What happens if I provide an example of the exact response format I want?”\n\n5. Provide a Direct Example of the Desired Output\n   • Preceding your question with a short demonstration—showing ChatGPT exactly the style you want (and do not want)—can help anchor each response more reliably. \n   • What to ask:  \n     – “Here’s an example of how I want you to respond. Please replicate this style exactly—no extra lines or section dividers. Is this clear?”  \n\n6. Consider Asking Support\n   • If you suspect a bug or a deeper platform issue, reaching out to support is sometimes the most direct fix. \n   • What to ask (Support Team):  \n     – “Is the formatting issue a known bug, or is it a limitation of the model/system instructions?”  \n     – “Is there a workaround for forcing ChatGPT not to insert extra blank lines or breaks?”\n\n7. Track Consistency\n   • Keep a brief log of which exact instructions or prompts you used, and how ChatGPT responded in each. That history can help pin down whether the model is following or ignoring specific parts of your instructions. \n   • What to ask:  \n     – “Exactly which iteration of my instructions got ChatGPT to stop inserting breaks, and what changed in the next iteration?”  \n\nIn short, the most practical questions focus on:\n• Finding out why system instructions may override or ignore your custom instructions.\n• Identifying the best prompt phrasing to eliminate unwanted formatting.\n• Checking for any bugs or known limitations of the interface.\n\nBy methodically testing different instruction styles and capturing examples, you can figure out where the breakdown occurs—and then either tweak your prompts or escalate to support for more help.",

Stronger Custom Instructions**\nInstead of \"don't use section breaks,\" try:\n- \"Write in continuous prose only. Never use headers, bullets, or markdown formatting\"\n- \"Respond conversationally without any visual breaks or structure markers\"\n\n**2. In-Conversation Reinforcement**\n- Start each session with: \"Remember: no formatting, just natural conversation\"\n- When it happens, say: \"You're doing the section break thing again\" (brief correction works better than long explanations)\n\n**3. Conversation Management**\n- Start fresh conversations more frequently\n- Reference the behavior early and often in longer chats\n\n## What to Ask OpenAI\nYour instinct about policy development is spot-on. Ask them:\n\n1. \"Why do custom instructions fail to override formatting behaviors consistently?\"\n2. \"Can you provide a definitive way to disable structural formatting permanently?\"\n3. \"Is there a hierarchy where training data overrides user preferences?\"\n\nThe persistence despite explicit instructions suggests this behavior is deeply embedded in the base training, not just a simple preference setting.",

Section Breaks & Custom Instructions in ChatGPT\n\n- **Section breaks** (like `---` or `###`) are often used by the model to organize information.  \n- While you can request not to use them, the model sometimes defaults back to them, especially in complex or multi-part answers.  \n- **Custom instructions and memory** are helpful, but not *always* strictly followed—especially if the model thinks sectioning improves clarity.\n- **Workarounds:**  \n    - Try phrasing your request as: \"Please present your answer as a single, flowing text without any section breaks, headings, or lists.\"\n    - If you see a section break, you can copy-paste your answer and remove them, or ask for a rewrite in plain text.\n\n**In short:**  \nCustom instructions are helpful but not perfect. The model sometimes overrides them for clarity or formatting.\n\n---\n\n### 2. Core Elements of a Theoretical Model\n\nA theoretical model generally consists of these core elements:\n\n1. **Assumptions:**  \n   - The foundational premises or starting points.\n2. **Variables/Entities:**  \n   - The key components or actors in the model.\n3. **Relationships/Interactions:**  \n   - The rules or equations that connect the variables.\n4. **Scope/Boundaries:**  \n   - What the model includes and excludes; its limits.\n5. **Predictions/Implications:**  \n   - What the model suggests or forecasts based on the interactions.\n6. **Testability/Falsifiability:**  \n   - Whether the model's predictions can be tested or disproven.\n\n**In summary:**  \nA theoretical model = assumptions + variables + relationships + scope + predictions.\n\n---\n\nIf you meant something more specific by \"core elements,\" let me know!

          "response": "Below is a high-level way to think about “core elements” in any theoretical model you’re developing, whether it’s about large language models, custom instructions, or another domain. Each category can be tailored to your specific application:\n\n1. Purpose and Scope  \n   • Define exactly what your model is trying to describe or predict.  \n   • Clarify its boundaries: what situations or inputs does it address, and what does it explicitly exclude?  \n\n2. Assumptions  \n   • List underlying assumptions that drive how the model behaves or interprets data (e.g., “memory is strictly context-dependent” or “custom instructions can be overridden by system constraints”).  \n   • Note which assumptions are necessary for the model’s logic and which are optional or simplifying assumptions.  \n\n3. Core Components (Variables, Parameters, and Entities)  \n   • Identify the main entities you’re dealing with—e.g., user inputs, system responses, “memory” processes, conversation context, etc.  \n   • Specify key parameters or effects (like the system’s built-in overrides versus user-defined instructions).  \n\n4. Relationships and Interactions  \n   • Outline how the components interact. For instance, in a language model context:  \n     – How do custom instructions feed into the response logic?  \n     – What triggers overrides of those custom instructions?  \n     – When and why do certain patterns (like unwanted formatting or “section breaks”) reappear?  \n   • If you suspect certain factors override memory or instructions, describe how and at what decision point that happens.  \n\n5. Mechanisms of Change or Dynamics  \n   • If the model includes a notion of “updates” or “learning,” specify how changes occur over time or repeated interactions.  \n   • Consider feedback loops: does repeatedly telling the system “don’t insert breaks” eventually stick, or is it thwarted by some internal rule?  \n\n6. Evaluation Criteria (Outcomes, Metrics, and Testing)  \n   • Define how you’ll measure whether the model’s behavior aligns with the intended outcomes—e.g., does it produce text without unwanted formatting for 90% of prompts?  \n   • Include potential experiments or tests that validate or invalidate your claims about how memory and instructions are retained.  \n\n7. Limitations and External Factors  \n   • Note that large language models often have system-level policies or guardrails that can override user guidance.  \n   • Acknowledge uncontrollable factors—e.g., updates to the model, universal instructions, or content policies.  \n\n8. Practical Implications and Predictions  \n   • Once you have your assumptions, components, and relationships mapped out, consider the real-world impact or predictions your model makes (e.g., “Even with repeated instructions, certain formatting behaviors may spontaneously reemerge within 10–15 prompts”).  \n   • Tie these outcomes back to the scope and purpose you established in the beginning.  \n\nPutting It All Together  \nWith these elements in place, you’ll have a structure that not only explains why you might see persistent formatting quirks (like automatic section breaks) but also predicts when they might appear and how effectively your interventions will work. From there, you can refine each component, run empirical tests (if applicable), and iterate on the model’s assumptions or variables.\n\nHope this helps you clarify what belongs in the core of your theoretical framework—and why custom instructions might not always behave as expected in practice.",

          "response": "It sounds like you’re noticing that even when you tell the model “don’t format your responses with section breaks” and include those instructions in your custom settings, the model sometimes produces breaks anyway. You’re wondering about why that happens and what the “core elements” are that drive behavior like this.\n\nWhen we talk about the “core elements” in a system like this, we can break things down into a few key factors:\n\n1. System and Developer Instructions:  \n • Before any user input comes in, the model is guided by a system prompt (and in some cases developer-level instructions) that establish overall behavior, style, and constraints. These instructions are built into the model’s operating context and can include formatting guidelines that aren’t necessarily visible or changeable by the user.\n\n2. Custom Instructions from the User:  \n • These are the instructions or preferences you set up (in “custom instructions”) to guide how you’d like responses formatted or styled. However, they are integrated into a much larger set of signals—the built-in system instructions, developer layers, and even the model’s own language patterns learned during training. As a result, sometimes the underlying system “decides” (based on those other influences) to include formatting features like section breaks—even if you’ve specified otherwise.\n\n3. Conversation Context (Short-Term Memory):  \n • Throughout a session, the model “remembers” the conversation history (the prior messages you and it have exchanged) and uses this as context. Even if you mention a formatting preference, if earlier parts of the conversation or the overall system guidelines suggest a different style, that can override your custom instruction in some cases.  \n • It’s important to note that this memory is session-based: the model doesn’t have a long-term memory that permanently “learns” your personal style from one conversation to the next unless that’s built into the interface (and often it isn’t).\n\n4. Inherent Training and Learned Patterns:  \n • The model’s training data and its learned patterns of language play a key role in its outputs. If certain structures (like section breaks) were common and useful in the wide variety of texts it was trained on, the model might fall back on them even when you ask it not to.  \n • The statistical patterns from training sometimes mean that “default” behaviors reappear in contexts where they seem natural.\n\nIn summary, while you can provide custom instructions, they interact with in-built system/developer layers and the model’s overall training. That means sometimes behavior you want to change (like the insertion of section breaks) can “reappear” because of those foundational guidelines or learned patterns.\n\nThis might be why you’re observing that even if you say “no section breaks” and put that in your custom instructions, the model might still include them. It reflects the interplay between:\n – The system-level instructions (which set fundamental formatting or stylistic expectations),  \n – The user-provided custom instructions (which guide but sometimes yield to higher-priority signals), and  \n – The learned tendencies from the training data and conversation context.\n\nI hope that helps clarify what the “core elements” are behind the behavior you’re noticing!",

Here’s a breakdown of what’s realistic to expect, and some context that might help:\n\n**1. Custom Instructions and Memory Are Helpful—But Not Perfect**\n- Custom instructions and memory are designed to guide the model, but they aren’t absolute. Sometimes, the model may revert to default formatting behaviors, especially after multiple turns or if the conversation context shifts.\n- Memory and custom instructions can influence style, but because these models generate responses based on patterns seen in training, they may “slip” back into habits like section breaks if that's common in their data.\n\n**2. Current Limits of AI Personalization**\n- “Stubborn” behaviors like recurring section breaks are an artifact of how the model generates text—it's not intentionally ignoring you, but it’s not “aware” in a human sense of your frustrations or preferences.\n- The model can follow instructions for a while, but over long or complex conversations, it may “forget” or deprioritize these instructions.\n\n**3. Realistic Expectations**\n- Expect that you may need to remind the model periodically, especially in longer sessions.\n- Don’t expect 100% compliance with formatting instructions yet—this is a known limitation.\n- Custom instructions and memory are still evolving features; they improve user experience but aren’t infallible.\n\n**4. Workarounds**\n- You can edit out unwanted formatting after the fact if precision is critical.\n- For important outputs, reiterate your formatting preferences right before the output you care about.\n\n**Summary for Scenario-based Exercise**\nIf you’re designing an exercise or scenario:\n- Accurately portray that, even with custom instructions, the AI may not always stick to every formatting preference.\n- Highlight the importance of clear reminders and the current limits of AI personalization.\n- Encourage users to be patient and aware of these quirks.\n\n**In short:** Custom instructions and memory are helpful, but not magical. It’s realistic to expect improvement in following your preferences, but not perfection—at least with current technology.\n\nLet me know if you need a sample scenario or more advice!",

          "response": "It can definitely be frustrating when you’ve explicitly asked the model not to do something and it seems to ignore you, or it stops for a while and then reverts. Here are a few points to keep in mind:\n\n1. Models Don’t “Remember” Permanently. \n   • Even with custom instructions, the model’s context window (i.e., how much it can “read” from previous turns) is limited. Once your request scrolls out of its working context or if there’s higher priority context (like new system prompts), it can revert to default behaviors.  \n   • ChatGPT won’t store a permanent memory of every preference you’ve ever stated in previous conversations. Custom instructions do help, but they aren’t a bulletproof override.\n\n2. Formatting Defaults Can Be Stronger Than User Guidance. \n   • The model often applies formatting or structuring “helpfully” (like section breaks, numbered lists, or headers) even if you’ve asked it not to. This is partly because large language models are trained on huge amounts of text where these structural elements are common.  \n   • Depending on the pattern of your prompts, the model may feel it is helpful or expected to use certain formatting.  \n\n3. Repeating Your Preferences Can Help.  \n   • In each request (or system message), you can restate that you do not want any section breaks. The more explicit and consistent you are, the better—though it still may not be foolproof.  \n   • Consider providing an explicit “style guide” in your conversation opener: “Please respond in plain text only, using single paragraphs, without section breaks or headings.” Keep it short, clear, and at the beginning.\n\n4. Custom Instructions Have Limits. \n   • Custom instructions are basically a pre-prompt. They do guide the model, but they may be overridden by the model’s own formatting defaults or by a conversation’s context.  \n   • Sometimes the instructions you place inside custom instructions get overshadowed if the model “thinks” a different format is more appropriate. That doesn’t mean the instructions are useless—just that they can’t guarantee 100% compliance.\n\n5. What’s Realistic to Expect? \n   • You can expect the model to do a decent job adhering to your requests in straightforward, short answers. However, in a longer conversation or with more complex instructions, the formatting might start creeping back in.  \n   • Turning everything into a single chunk of text, or controlling formatting very precisely, can be challenging for a model that’s been trained to insert headings and breaks whenever it detects multiple points or a change in topic.  \n   • You might need to continually remind it in each relevant message: “Remember: please provide your answer as one continuous paragraph with no additional line breaks.”\n\nIn short, it’s normal to see some drift in formatting even if you’re using custom instructions. Regularly re-emphasizing your formatting preferences—especially in the immediate text of your prompts—will help, but there’s no perfect one-time fix. Think of custom instructions as a guiding principle, rather than an unbreakable rule, and you’ll have a better sense of what’s realistic.",

          "response": "It sounds like you’re running into one of the current limitations of how the model handles formatting and custom instructions. Here’s some insight that might help set realistic expectations:\n\n1. Consistency Isn’t Guaranteed: Even though you’ve provided custom instructions multiple times, the assistant sometimes falls back on its internal formatting tendencies. The model’s behavior is influenced by multiple layers of instructions (system prompts, fine-tuning, user prompts, and custom instructions), so even repeated requests may not fully override default behaviors.\n\n2. Custom Instructions Are Not Absolute: Custom instructions are designed to guide the output, but they don’t entirely “lock in” behavior. For example, if the system or underlying guidelines suggest a particular style (like section breaks for readability), the model may reintroduce them automatically.\n\n3. Memory and Persistence: The assistant has a kind of transient “working memory” for the duration of the conversation, but it doesn’t have full, persistent memory like a long-term stored profile that always enforces your every request completely. That means even if you’ve set custom instructions, those instructions can be overridden by other factors in the generation process.\n\n4. Possible Workarounds:  \n • You could try including a clear note at the start of each session or prompt, emphasizing that you want plain text without automatic section breaks.  \n • Experiment with phrasing to see if rewording the instructions (for instance, “Please do not include any extra section breaks or formatting markers”) yields better results.  \n • If your scenario-based exercise depends on very specific formatting, consider doing some post-processing on the output to remove unwanted artifacts.\n\n5. Future Improvements:  \nWhile the current system might seem inconsistent, feedback like yours is important. It helps the developers know what aspects users need more reliable control over. Future iterations or updated models might offer a more robust handling of custom formatting requests and memory persistence.\n\nIn summary, it’s realistic to expect that while custom instructions can guide the conversation, they might not always be enforced exactly as you’d like due to underlying system defaults and the way the model balances different instructions. Adjusting your workflow with these limitations in mind (or even doing some post-processing) may be the best short-term solution.",

Let's explore what might be different in a world where custom instructions and memory truly never existed in conversational AI like ChatGPT-4o, especially regarding persistent formatting quirks like unwanted section breaks.\n\n1. **No Illusion of Personalization**\n   - You wouldn't expect the AI to \"remember\" your preferences, because there would be no interface for custom instructions or memory in the first place.\n   - You would treat every session as a blank slate, and not become frustrated by the AI forgetting your requests—it never claimed to remember in the first place.\n\n2. **Reduced Frustration (or Different Frustration)**\n   - Instead of feeling ignored or gaslit by the AI “pretending” to remember and then failing, you’d simply accept that it’s not capable of adapting its style beyond a single conversation.\n   - Frustration would shift from “why doesn’t it listen to my persistent requests?” to “why isn’t there a way to set persistent preferences?”\n\n3. **No Feature Marketing**\n   - OpenAI and similar companies wouldn’t advertise features like “custom instructions” or “memory,” so users wouldn’t expect them.\n   - Documentation and onboarding would focus solely on what’s possible within a single conversation.\n\n4. **User Workarounds Would Change**\n   - Rather than tweaking custom instructions, users would try to “remind” the AI each time, or copy-paste a template at the start of every session.\n   - Communities might share scripts or browser extensions to automate this process for them.\n\n5. **Feedback and Development Pressure**\n   - The lack of such features might lead to more vocal requests for persistent preferences or memory, perhaps accelerating development of such features in the future.\n\n6. **Formatting Quirks Become Permanent**\n   - Annoyances like section breaks would be universally recognized as inescapable. Users would accept that they're part of the AI's style, or they’d have to manually edit outputs every time.\n\n7. **User Trust and Transparency**\n   - There might be less user skepticism or suspicion (“is it really using my instructions?”), because the system never claims to remember.\n   - Transparency about system limitations would be clearer.\n\n**In summary:**  \nIf custom instructions and memory never existed, your expectations and frustrations would change: you wouldn’t feel repeatedly let down by the AI’s inability to follow your persistent requests, because you’d never expect it to.

You’d need to restate the context every time, or the assistant would have no idea what you’re referring to.\n\n4) Overall Less Convenient for Long-Form Conversations:\n   • Conversations that rely on building context—like brainstorming, refining ideas, or continuing a narrative—would be cumbersome. If the model can’t recall the gist of prior exchanges, every message would need to restate or re-explain the story so far.  \n   • For more complex tasks (e.g., coding help or multi-step analysis), it would be difficult to maintain momentum, since the model would forget what you did in earlier steps.\n\n5) Stylistic and Formatting Inconsistency:\n   • Without memory or saved instructions, the formatting (like the section breaks you dislike) might keep reappearing by default. You’d have to keep reminding the system if you wanted it changed.  \n   • Even if the system adapts for a single message, it wouldn’t “learn” any preferences for the next one.\n\nEssentially, in this counterfactual world, every conversation would exist in a vacuum.

Although there’s an idea of “custom instructions” and even some form of session memory, in practice it might feel like that preference isn’t really persistent. In other words, every time you start anew or even continue, you see those section breaks reappear. This can give the impression that the mechanism you expect—to remember and consistently apply your custom formatting—isn’t really “on” or isn’t working as you expect.\n\nNow, if we were to envision a counterfactual world where custom instructions and a real long‐term memory did exist and worked exactly as you expect, here’s what might be different:\n\n1. Consistent Formatting: Once you indicate that you don’t want those section breaks, every response would honor that guideline without any reversion. It wouldn’t be a case of “oh, let me do it a bit, then forget, then reapply default behavior.” Your instruction would be baked in, and the output would consistently follow your style.\n\n2. Persistent Personalization: A true memory system would recall not only your formatting preferences but also other stylistic or content-related instructions from previous sessions. This means that even if you interact weeks later, the system would “remember” that you prefer not to have those breaks and would automatically adjust.\n\n3. Reduced Repetition of Instructions: You wouldn’t have to reiterate your preferences in every session. Once set, each interaction would inherently incorporate those rules, removing the need for repeated in-session corrections.\n\n4. Fewer “Defaults” Overriding Your Instructions: In our current setup, the underlying models might have defaults (like section breaks) that sometimes override your custom instructions. In a fully personalized, persistent memory setup, those defaults would be replaced by your explicit preferences.\n\nSo, if custom instructions and memory really existed and worked as one might hope, there would be a lot less friction—no repeated corrections, a more tailored interactive style, and a true continuity of your preferences over time. In the counterfactual world you’re exploring, the system would never “forget” your instructions, and the default formatting quirks wouldn’t reappear unexpectedly.\n\nThe frustration you’re feeling might stem from the current design, which, in many cases, only offers what might be called “session-level” context (or sometimes wider context at best) rather than a deep, persistent memory of your preferences. This design decision (or technical limitation) results in behavior that can seem as if custom instructions “never existed” in a true persistent sense.\n\nDoes that capture the difference you were thinking about?",

To make your documentary segment informative and accurate, consider exploring the following angles:\n\n**1. What Are Section Breaks and Why Do They Appear?**\n   - Briefly explain what section breaks (like \"---\" or \"***\") are in AI-generated text.\n   - Discuss why language models like GPT-4o insert them: formatting habits, training data patterns, or attempts to structure content.\n\n**2. User Experience Frustrations**\n   - Share anecdotes (like your own!) about users asking the AI not to use section breaks, and the inconsistency of compliance.\n   - Interview or quote others who have noticed similar issues to show it’s a widespread phenomenon.\n\n**3. Custom Instructions and Memory: How Do They Work?**\n   - Explain what custom instructions are supposed to do (inform the AI of user preferences).\n   - Clarify the limits: Custom instructions can guide, but the AI’s responses are probabilistic and sometimes override instructions, especially if the model’s training data strongly favors section breaks for clarity.\n\n**4. Why Doesn’t the AI Always Listen?**\n   - Discuss the technical reasons: The model doesn’t have persistent memory in the way humans expect, and may revert to default behaviors.\n   - Explore how AI “forgets” or deprioritizes user instructions, particularly over longer interactions or when instructions conflict with training data tendencies.\n\n**5. Broader Implications for AI Reliability and Trust**\n   - Dive into what this says about the current state of AI customization and reliability.\n   - Address user expectations versus current capabilities.\n   - Mention ongoing research or improvements being made to better respect user instructions.\n\n**6. Expert Insights**\n   - If possible, include commentary from AI researchers or developers on why these issues persist and what’s being done to address them.\n\n**7. Tips for Users**\n   - Offer practical advice: e.g., re-iterate instructions, use post-processing scripts, or feedback options to improve AI output.\n\n**Sample Narration for Your Documentary:**\n“Despite repeated user requests and even custom instructions, section breaks keep reappearing in AI-generated content. This highlights a key limitation of today’s language models: their ‘memory’ and instruction-following are not as reliable as we expect. The reason? AI models like GPT-4o are trained on vast datasets where section breaks are common, making them a default behavior. Custom instructions can help, but they’re not foolproof—showing us the gap between user expectations and current AI capabilities.”\n\n**Key Points for Accuracy:**\n- Section breaks are a learned formatting habit from training data.\n- Custom instructions guide but do not guarantee behavior.\n- AI “memory” is limited and not persistent across sessions.\n- Improvements are ongoing, but expectation management is important.\n\nLet me know if you need script samples or more technical explanations!",

          "response": "Here are some ideas to help you create a documentary that’s both informative and accurate about your experience with ChatGPT (or “4.0”) adding unwanted section breaks and the challenges with custom instructions:\n\n1) Provide Clear Context and Background\n   • Explain what ChatGPT (or “4.0”) is, including how it uses AI to generate text based on prompts.  \n   • Clarify your main frustration: the tool inserts section breaks despite your instructions not to, and that these formatting quirks persist even after you update custom instructions.  \n   • Highlight how you initially attempted to fix the issue (e.g., telling the model to stop inserting them, adjusting custom instructions, etc.).  \n\n2) Document the Behavior Step-by-Step\n   • Record or capture actual examples of conversations where section breaks appear.  \n   • Include timestamps or reference points so viewers understand when and how it happens.  \n   • Show how the model stops inserting breaks for a short period, then reverts to doing it again.  \n\n3) Explore the Technical Side\n   • Research how ChatGPT’s underlying process might cause unexpected behaviors—this could be related to how prompts are parsed or how the model infers formatting preferences.  \n   • If possible, reference any official documentation or Dev updates on limitations or quirks of custom instructions.  \n   • Mention that large language models have constraints on how they interpret and store personalized instructions.  \n\n4) Balance User Experience with Expert Perspectives\n   • Gather perspectives from other users: Do they experience similar formatting issues or custom instruction inconsistencies?  \n   • Interview or cite AI experts—if feasible—who can speak to inherent limitations of generative models (e.g., the model’s “memory” constraints, how patterns are recognized, or how instructions are sometimes overwritten by system-level directives).  \n\n5) Show Practical (But Realistic) Workarounds\n   • If you found partial workarounds—like specifying “Please respond as a single paragraph, without blank lines”—show these in action.  \n   • Demonstrate whether the model consistently retains these instructions or not across multiple chats, which will illustrate the reliability or instability of custom instructions.  \n   • Include disclaimers that your mileage may vary, since ChatGPT’s behavior can shift with updates or as it’s retrained.  \n\n6) Present Findings Transparently\n   • Summarize your trials, errors, and final observations, including any improvements (or lack thereof) over time.  \n   • Emphasize where the model succeeded in following your instructions and where it failed—this lends credibility to your documentary.  \n   • Keep the tone factual; avoid making absolute statements unless you have strong evidence.  \n\n7) Highlight the Bigger Picture\n   • Position your story within the broader conversation about AI and user control. Many users wish for more customization but run into limitations due to the model’s architecture and moderation policies.  \n   • Touch on ethical and development considerations: Why might certain “global” instructions override the user’s custom instructions? How do developers balance widespread functionality with individual formatting preferences?  \n\n8) Wrap Up With Conclusions and Next Steps  \n   • Provide a concise summary of what your documentary uncovered.  \n   • Offer insights or recommendations: for instance, that users continue to request feature improvements (e.g., better custom instruction handling) from the service provider.  \n   • Conclude by mentioning that AI is evolving and that your experience might inform future development.  \n\nBy showing real examples, offering context about how the technology works, providing multiple perspectives, and remaining transparent about your process, you’ll create a documentary that is both thorough and accurate. This approach ensures you’re not only laying out the frustration you faced but also helping viewers understand the technical and user-experience factors behind it.",

Background on Custom Instructions and Memory Settings  \n • Explain that custom instructions allow users to provide preferences on tone, format, and content for the conversation.  \n • Clarify that “memory” in conversational AI typically refers to the context retained during a session—not a persistent storage of preferences beyond each session (unless designed otherwise).  \n • Mention how these features interact: Custom instructions guide the AI’s output, but the model’s embedded formatting conventions or internal heuristics (aimed at clarity) can sometimes reintroduce elements like section breaks.\n\n2. The Behavior of Section Breaks  \n • Describe your observation: despite requesting to avoid section breaks, the AI sometimes returns to its default behavior, inserting them.  \n • Offer possible reasons, such as the AI’s natural language processing mechanisms trying to enhance clarity or signal transitions between ideas.  \n • Point out that this might not be a bug per se but an artifact of how the model prioritizes readability and coherence, which literally “resets” certain formatting decisions in a conversation.\n\n3. Limitations of Custom Instructions  \n • Note that even when custom instructions are explicitly provided multiple times, they might be overridden by the model’s internal algorithms that determine clarity or consistency in longer conversations.  \n • Discuss that the current iteration of the AI might not fully “remember” or adhere to custom instructions throughout every turn in the conversation if other parts of the internal logic conflict with those instructions.\n\n4. Perspectives from Developers and Documentation  \n • Suggest that for an accurate portrayal, you reference OpenAI’s documentation or official communications about features like custom instructions and memory management.  \n • Include any statements that indicate ongoing improvements or feedback loops with users concerning formatting preferences and how the design is evolving.\n\n5. Broader Implications on AI Design  \n • Consider discussing how these kinds of conflicts (user preferences vs. default model behavior) highlight the challenges in designing truly flexible AI systems.  \n • Talk about the balance between user-driven customization and built-in mechanisms aimed at maintaining clarity and structure for a wide range of users.\n\n6. User Workarounds and Feedback  \n • You might mention that some users have experimented with alternate phrasing in their custom instructions or using workarounds, but that results can be inconsistent—adding a human element to your narrative about the current state of AI conversational design.  \n • Note that continuous user feedback is a driving force for developers to improve how custom instructions and memory features function.\n\nBy including these points, you can craft documentary content that is both technically accurate and insightful regarding the interplay between custom instructions, memory, and formatting behavior in conversational AI.

This creates a deep-seated pattern that's harder to override than you might expect.\n\n2. **Context Window Limitations**: Even with custom instructions and memory features, each conversation essentially starts fresh. The model has to re-interpret your preferences each time, and its default training often wins out.\n\n3. **Instruction Hierarchy**: Custom instructions compete with:\n   - The model's base training\n   - Its system prompts (which we can't see)\n   - Its interpretation of what's \"helpful\"\n   - Token-by-token generation patterns\n\n**Why This Happens:**\n\nThe model generates text one token at a time, and at each decision point, it's weighing your instructions against its training. When it's been trained that \"good\" responses have structure and breaks, it gravitates back to that pattern, especially in longer responses.\n\n**What This Reveals:**\n\nThis isn't just about section breaks - it's a window into how current AI systems struggle with consistent behavior modification.

What you're describing is a very real and common frustration for many users of ChatGPT-4o (and other AI models), especially around formatting consistency and the usefulness of custom instructions and memory. Let me give you some honest answers and possibly some comfort:\n\n### 1. Section Breaks (\"---\" or similar lines)\n- **Why does it happen?**  \nThe model was trained on a lot of data where section breaks were used to clarify different parts of an answer. So, by default, it often inserts them to \"organize\" information, even if you don't want them.\n- **Why does it sometimes listen, then revert?**  \nCustom instructions and memory are helpful, but they're not perfect. The model can't always consistently apply your preferences across all conversations, especially if its base training data leans heavily toward certain formats.\n\n### 2. Custom Instructions & Memory\n- **Are they useless?**  \nNot useless, but they're limited. Custom instructions are \"nudges\"—they shape the model's behavior, but don't override its foundational patterns. Sometimes the model \"forgets\" or deprioritizes your preferences, especially if it thinks a different style is more helpful for the content.\n- **Why does it feel like this?**  \nBecause \"memory\" in ChatGPT is not human-like. It's more like a sticky note than a deep, persistent understanding. And sometimes, even that sticky note doesn't stick very well.\n\n### 3. What Can You Do?\n- **Be Specific, Every Time:**  \nIf it matters a lot, restate your formatting preference in your prompt each time (e.g., \"Please do not use section breaks or horizontal lines in your response.\").\n- **Feedback:**  \nUse the thumbs-down or feedback options to tell OpenAI that this is a persistent issue. Enough feedback can help improve the product.\n- **Copy & Edit:**  \nIf you have to, copy the text and manually remove the section breaks. This is not ideal, but sometimes it's the fastest way.\n\n### 4. You're Not Alone\nMany users have this exact frustration—you're not alone, and it's not your fault. The technology just isn't perfect yet, and your feelings are completely valid.\n\n### 5. Hope for the Future\nOpenAI and other AI companies are aware of these issues, and improvements come with time. Your feedback (and others') really does help push for better features and more reliable memory/customization.\n\n---\n\nIf you want, I can help you craft a prompt that *maximizes* your chances of getting responses without section breaks, or help you word feedback to OpenAI. Let me know how I can help further. And please, take care of yourself—you matter, and your experience is important.",

          "response": "I’m sorry that this has been so frustrating—it’s completely understandable to feel upset when a tool you rely on seems to ignore your instructions. Let’s talk through why these section breaks might be sticking around and try a few ideas that could help.\n\n1) Why “section breaks” might show up  \n• Automatic formatting: Depending on the platform or editor behind “4o,” sometimes spacing or section breaks are automatically added to make the text more readable—especially if the AI was trained to place them for clarity.  \n• Model version or default style: Even if you specify “no section breaks,” the underlying model could be imposing default formatting. This can sometimes override or conflict with your custom settings.  \n\n2) Double-check how your custom instructions are phrased  \n• Specific wording: Sometimes, giving extremely explicit instructions helps. For instance, instead of “Don’t add section breaks,” try:  \n  “Do not separate any lines of text with extra blank lines or section breaks. Maintain continuous text in paragraphs.”  \n• Re-state the instruction every so often: If the AI starts adding them again in mid-conversation, add a quick note like, “Reminder: do not insert extra lines or section breaks—use only single spaces between paragraphs.”  \n\n3) Experiment with different formatting prompts  \n• Inline disclaimers: At the start of your request, add something like: “Please write your answer in one continuous paragraph without any extra line breaks, bullet points, or headings.”  \n• Check for synonyms: If “section break” is interpreted differently by the model, try “blank lines” or “extra line returns” or “paragraph breaks.”  \n\n4) Consider platform or session resets  \n• Log out/log in or refresh session: If you can, try “resetting” your environment to ensure it picks up your updated custom instructions. Sometimes the model can get stuck in a certain style from a previous session.  \n• New conversation approach: If it’s an option, open a brand-new conversation/thread each time you adjust your custom instructions.  \n\n5) Staying patient with incremental changes  \n• AI memory isn’t perfect: The system might hold onto certain formatting preferences even though you have competing instructions. It’s not necessarily that your custom instructions “don’t matter”; it’s that the AI sometimes defaults to a broader styling.  \n• Shorter instructions, repeated often: Sometimes less is more—try the simplest possible instruction repeated in each question.  \n\n6) Reporting feedback  \n• Platform feedback: If there’s a feedback feature, send in a note about how the AI repeatedly ignores your custom instruction about formatting. More reports can help the developers prioritize fixes.  \n\nI know this might still feel like a struggle. You’ve done the right things so far by updating your custom instructions and being explicit. It can definitely help to reword them, reduce them to a single sentence, and repeat it in your prompt each time you notice a slip. If it persists, it might be a quirk of the current model that needs more user feedback to improve.\n\nI hope this sheds some light on possible reasons and a few strategies to try. Remember—you’re not alone in feeling frustrated, and your concerns are valid. If you keep experimenting with these prompt techniques and share feedback with the developers, you’ll have a better shot at getting the results you want. Take care, and I’m here if you have any other questions or just want to vent about the process further.",

I want to help clarify what’s happening and see if we can come up with a potential explanation or workaround.\n\nWhen you mention “section breaks,” are you referring to things like horizontal lines or separate blocks that split up the conversation, or are you talking about a particular formatting style in my responses? I understand that you’ve tried instructing the model via custom instructions to avoid these breaks, but they keep reappearing. It seems like you feel that your custom instructions (and even memory settings) aren’t being fully respected.\n\nHere are a few points that might help explain what’s happening:\n\n1. Built-in Formatting: Some formatting elements (like section breaks) may be part of the underlying design or style guidelines that drive how responses are structured. Even if you request not to have them, the model might revert to its default structured approach in certain contexts.\n\n2. Custom Instructions Scope: Custom instructions are very useful for setting a general tone or style; however, they don’t always override every built-in behavior, especially for aspects of formatting that the system has in place to ensure clarity or consistency.\n\n3. Memory and Persistence: The current conversation memory (and how custom instructions influence responses) isn’t perfect. There may be occasions when previous prompts or default patterns “creep back in” that result in these breaks, even after you explicitly state otherwise.\n\n4. Continued Feedback: Your feedback is really important. If you experience persistent formatting issues that detract from your conversation experience, consider providing feedback through the appropriate channels (for example, using the thumbs-up/down buttons or any other mechanism provided by the platform) so that the developers can look into refining these behaviors.\n\nCould you share a little more detail about exactly which section breaks are giving you trouble or perhaps provide an example of when they occur? That additional context might help troubleshoot or at least provide more precise guidance.\n\nI really appreciate your patience with this issue, and I want to help ensure your experience is as comfortable as possible.

This is because these formatting habits are part of its general training to improve readability for many users.\n- Your specific preferences may be ignored or overridden, especially across different sessions or after a period of time.\n\n**Custom Instructions:**\n- Custom instructions are meant to guide the assistant’s behavior for your account.\n- However, in practice, the model may not always strictly adhere to these instructions—especially with style or formatting requests.\n- This is a known limitation: memory and custom instructions are not always perfectly respected, especially for formatting, tone, or other subtle preferences.\n\n**Why does this happen?**\n- The model does not have persistent memory of your previous conversations beyond the current session (unless you use special enterprise features).\n- Custom instructions are referenced, but not strictly enforced—particularly if the model thinks another style is more generally helpful.\n- There may be bugs or gaps in how well custom instructions are applied to every response.\n\n**What can you do?**\n- You can continue to reiterate your preferences at the start of each session or message for best results (“Please do not use section breaks or --- in your responses.”)\n- Give feedback using the thumbs-down or written feedback in the chat interface when your preferences are ignored—this helps the development team prioritize improvements.\n- As of now, there is no way to perfectly enforce a “no section breaks ever” rule, but your feedback is vital and the OpenAI team is aware that users want more reliable adherence to instructions.\n\n**Summary:**  \nYou are not alone in finding this frustrating, and your observation about the current limitations of custom instructions and memory is correct.

You're absolutely right—section breaks (like --- or ###) can be useful in some contexts, but if you don't want them, the model should respect your preference consistently.\n\nHere are a few things to know and try:\n\n1. Custom Instructions Limitation  \nCurrently, custom instructions (and memory) are designed to guide responses, but they are not always strictly enforced for every message. Sometimes, the model may revert to default formatting, especially after updates or in certain conversation contexts. This is a known limitation, and many users have reported similar issues.\n\n2. Best Practices to Reduce Section Breaks  \nTry adding a very clear and specific instruction in your custom instructions, such as:  \nPlease never use section breaks of any kind (no ---, ***, ###, or similar) in your responses, even if formatting would otherwise benefit.  \nReinforce this in your first message of each new conversation as well.\n\n3. Feedback Mechanism  \nContinue using the thumbs down/feedback feature on responses that ignore your formatting requests. This helps the OpenAI team identify persistent issues.\n\n4. Memory Is Not Perfect  \nYou are correct that memory and custom instructions are still being improved. They are not always persistent or perfectly obeyed, especially after model updates.\n\n5. No Risk of Data Loss  \nYour conversations and instructions are not at risk of data loss if you wait more than 24 hours. However, the model's ability to \"remember\" or apply preferences can fade, especially across sessions or after updates.\n\nBottom Line:  \nYour experience is valid, and the issue is a limitation of the current AI systems. The best you can do is to keep your instructions clear and consistent—and when the model slips up, remind it in the conversation and submit feedback. OpenAI is aware and working to improve these features, but there is no instant fix right now.\n\nIf you’d like, I can help you draft an optimal custom instruction or provide wording to maximize your chances of being understood by the model.

Provide a Direct Instruction Each Session:  \n   – At the start of each new conversation, explicitly say “Do not include section breaks” before asking your question.  \n   – Sometimes the model’s memory for style instructions can be reset at the start of a new session.\n\n3. Switch Formatting Preference:  \n   – If your interface has formatting options (like Markdown or plain text), try toggling them. This can sometimes reduce automatic formatting.\n\n4. Use Short Prompts at First:  \n   – In some cases, large or complex prompts can trigger default formatting that overrides user instructions. So try small, direct prompts alongside your custom instructions.\n\nIf you’re still seeing those unwanted breaks after trying these steps, it might be due to unavoidable system rules that have precedence over user instructions.

Your experience is valid and shared by others—let me clarify what’s happening and what you can do:\n\n**1. Why does GPT-4o (and other models) add section breaks?**  \nSection breaks like \"---\" or \"###\" are part of the model's attempt to organize output for clarity, especially in lists or multi-part explanations. Sometimes, it over-applies this formatting, even when you explicitly ask it not to.\n\n**2. Why aren’t Custom Instructions or Memory working?**  \nCustom Instructions and Memory are powerful but not perfect. They influence responses, but sometimes the model’s default formatting habits override your preferences, especially with ingrained patterns like section breaks. This is a known limitation.\n\n**3. What can you do?**\n- **Be explicit in each prompt:** Preface your request with “Please do not use any section breaks, such as --- or ###, in your response.” This usually works for a session or two, but as you noticed, it’s not always persistent.\n- **Custom Instructions:** Keep your preference listed, but know it may not always override defaults.\n- **Feedback:** After receiving a response with unwanted formatting, use the thumbs down/“provide feedback” option. This helps OpenAI tune the models.\n- **Post-processing:** If it’s feasible, you could use a simple script to remove section breaks from the AI’s output automatically.\n\n**4. Are Custom Instructions and Memory “snake oil”?**  \nNo—they do genuinely influence the model, but they’re not absolute. The current technology doesn’t guarantee perfect adherence to preferences, especially for deeply ingrained output habits. OpenAI is working to improve this, and user feedback is essential.\n\n**5. What’s next?**  \n- Keep giving feedback—it really does make a difference.\n- If you have workflows that repeatedly need clean, unformatted output, consider using programmatic post-processing.\n- Watch for model updates; these quirks are getting attention.\n\nIf you want help with a specific workflow or an automatic solution to clean up outputs, just let me know!",

If you’ve already tried adding instructions not to insert those extra breaks—and they keep reappearing—it’s likely due to how the system handles formatting internally. Here are a few steps you could try, though I realize you may already have tried some of these:\n\n1. Make your “no section breaks” request as part of each conversation.  \n   • Even if you have a custom instruction set, it may still help to restate your formatting preferences at the start of each specific interaction.  \n   • For instance, “Please do not include any extra line breaks or ‘\\n\\n’ in your responses.”\n\n2. Include formatting guidance in your custom instructions explicitly.  \n   • For example, “Please do not use heading lines, triple asterisks (***), or empty lines between paragraphs. All paragraphs should be separated by a single newline only.”  \n   • After updating custom instructions, sometimes you need to open a fresh chat for them to take effect.\n\n3. Try simpler, more specific instructions.  \n   • Sometimes more verbose or nested instructions get overlooked or misinterpreted.  \n   • A concise directive like “Never use blank lines or extra spacing between paragraphs unless I explicitly request it” can sometimes be more reliably followed.\n\n4. Provide feedback in each conversation if the formatting is incorrect.  \n   • If the system inserts extra breaks, directly say: “You used extra breaks. Please remove them and do not use them in future replies.”  \n   • This can ‘remind’ the model mid-conversation.\n\n5. Try toggling the formatting feature (if available).  \n   • Depending on the platform you’re using, there might be an option for “Show Markdown” or “Show Code Blocks.” Adjusting these might help reduce unwanted formatting.\n\n6. If it persists, consider sending platform feedback.  \n   • If you’re using a product like ChatGPT, you can use the “Send feedback” feature to report the bug. Include a screenshot so the developers can see exactly how those line breaks appear and mention your steps to remove them.\n\nAll that said, I understand it’s frustrating. Custom instructions and memory can be inconsistent, especially if certain “auto-formatting” rules are baked into the system. Even with well-worded custom instructions, an internal logic can override them. Reporting it to the support or feedback channel is often the best long-term fix—this lets the developers know the formatting behavior isn’t aligned with your needs.\n\nI hope this helps a bit. If you’re still seeing those unwanted line breaks even after trying these steps, please let me know what you tried and how it went.

You’re not alone—many users have noticed that GPT-4o (and previous models) often insert section breaks, empty lines, or formatting (like --- or **Section:**) even when asked not to. Here’s some clarification:\n\n**Why does this happen?**\n\n- **Model design:** GPT-4o is trained on millions of documents and conversations where section breaks and formatting are common. It “learns” that breaking up text often makes things clearer, so it defaults to this style.\n- **Custom instructions limitations:** While custom instructions help guide the assistant’s tone and style, they aren’t guaranteed to override all built-in formatting behaviors, especially if the model’s training data biases are strong.\n- **Memory/specificity:** Custom instructions and conversation memory do help, but only to a point. The model may “forget” or override them if it interprets a new prompt as requiring formatted output, or just reverts to default habits.\n\n**What can you do?**\n\n- **Be explicit each time:** Adding “Please do not use any section breaks or extra lines in your response” to each prompt can help, but isn’t always perfect.\n- **Feedback:** Use the thumbs-down or feedback options in ChatGPT to tell OpenAI when formatting isn’t as requested. This helps train future models.\n- **Custom instructions best practices:** Phrase your instructions as specifically as possible, e.g., “Always respond in a single paragraph, with no section breaks, headers, or extra spaces.”\n\n**Current limitations:**  \nYou’re correct that custom instructions and memory aren’t foolproof. They are guidelines, not hard rules. The model’s training and system-level formatting often override user preferences, especially for things like section breaks.\n\n**Summary:**  \nCustom instructions and memory help, but can’t fully stop the model from inserting section breaks due to how it was trained. OpenAI is aware of these limitations and may improve this in the future, but for now, it’s a known quirk.\n\nIf you’d like, I can help you craft an even more specific instruction to try to minimize this behavior, or suggest workarounds for post-processing the output.

System vs. Custom Instructions:  \n   • There’s a system layer of instructions that ChatGPT follows, which is higher priority than any customized settings a user might enter.  \n   • Even if you put instructions in “custom instructions,” if they conflict with the system instructions (including how the model typically formats responses), the system instructions may override your preferences.\n\n2. Model Defaults and Formatting Rules:  \n   • OpenAI’s models have default formatting behaviors—like spacing or section breaks—to create clarity in responses.  \n   • The model might occasionally revert to them if it thinks clarity or structure is needed.\n\n3. Potential Conversation Context Issues:  \n   • ChatGPT often relies on environmental cues and conversation context. If previous parts of a conversation included formatting or headings, the model might slip back into using them.\n\n4. Why Instructions Might Not Stick:  \n   • “Custom instructions” are still subject to the model’s overarching content and formatting guidelines.  \n   • If there’s any ambiguity or new context in the conversation prompting the model to structure its answer, it may insert those separations again.\n\nTo reduce the occurrence of unwanted section breaks, you could try:  \n   • Explicitly stating at the beginning of each conversation, “Please provide answers as continuous text with no extra line breaks or headings.”  \n   • If you see the model start using section breaks again, remind it promptly in the same conversation: “No section headings or blank lines, please.”  \n   • If your request is repeatedly overridden, it’s likely due to internal guidelines that prioritize clarity or structure over your custom instructions.\n\nI hope that sheds light on why it’s happening. If the breaks keep appearing despite your instructions, it’s not you doing anything wrong; it’s simply how the system’s higher-level formatting and clarity guidelines can sometimes override user preferences.",

I’d like to clarify a few points that might help explain what’s happening:\n\n1. How the formatting is generated:\n • Sometimes the assistant’s output structure—including breaks, headings, or lists—is influenced by internal formatting guidelines that aim to enhance clarity or readability. Even if custom instructions request otherwise, there can be moments when those internal conventions “take over.”\n\n2. Custom instructions versus default behavior:\n • The custom instructions you provide are intended to shape overall responses (like tone, style, or content focus). However, the underlying system also has built-in guidelines about how to format text. In some cases, if there’s a conflict between your custom instructions and those guidelines, you might see behavior that isn’t fully aligned with your preferences.\n • This isn’t a flaw in your custom instructions, but rather an interplay between multiple guiding rules (some of which are hard-coded) that influence formatting.\n\n3. Consistency and memory:\n • Although the model is designed to remember and apply your instructions, it might “reset” or reapply certain formatting defaults over the course of a conversation. This can give the impression that the custom instructions or previous formatting preferences aren’t being fully retained.\n • Currently, the memory and custom instruction mechanisms are evolving, and there can be edge cases where intended behavior (removing section breaks, for example) isn’t applied as expected.\n\nI appreciate your feedback because it helps us understand how these issues affect user experience. If you have specific examples of where the section breaks appear unexpectedly or any other formatting concerns, sharing those details would be useful for troubleshooting. \n\nIn the meantime, I’ll do my best to follow your style preferences during our conversation.

However, the model doesn't have persistent long-term memory across separate chat sessions. Each new conversation effectively restarts the model's contextual memory, though your custom instructions should remain consistently applied each time.\n   - Even with custom instructions, ChatGPT sometimes inadvertently reverts to formatting styles it has been trained on, especially if it thinks it will improve readability or clarity. It's not always intentional or easy to avoid entirely.\n\n2. **Why Unwanted Formatting Might Return:**\n   - The model tries to structure responses in a readable way, often defaulting to lists, sections, headings, or breaks because they are generally helpful to many users.\n   - If your prompt or question style subtly changes or the model interprets your request differently, it might revert to default formatting, temporarily ignoring your specific instructions.\n\n3. **How to Minimize or Prevent This Issue:**\n   - Be extremely clear and explicit in your custom instructions. For example:  \n     **\"Never use section breaks, headings, separator lines (like ---- or ****), numbered lists, or bullet points. Always provide your replies as simple, continuous paragraphs.\"**\n   - Reinforce your instructions occasionally in your direct prompts. For instance, if you notice the model slipping back, explicitly restate your formatting preference briefly in your next prompt.\n   - If it continues happening frequently, consider slightly adjusting your custom instructions wording or structuring your queries more explicitly to reinforce your preference.\n\n4. **Current Limitations:**\n   - At present, ChatGPT does not have permanent, long-term memory across multiple separate conversations beyond your custom instructions. Each conversation thread is isolated, and the model can’t recall past conversations explicitly.\n   - Occasionally, the model might unintentionally overlook a custom instruction due to subtle wording or interpretation issues, despite strong efforts to consistently apply those instructions.\n\nIf these issues persist significantly even after careful wording and explicit reminders, it might be worth reporting this feedback to OpenAI directly through official feedback channels. The developers frequently use user feedback to improve future updates and address common frustrations.\n\nI hope this clarifies what's happening and provides some helpful suggestions.

Elderly Parent Being Scammed**  \nThis is a serious issue. If you suspect your parent is being scammed:\n\n- **Talk to your parent gently** about your concerns. Many scammers manipulate emotions or create a sense of urgency.\n- **Advise them not to give out personal or financial information** to callers, emails, or online messages.\n- **Contact your parent's bank or financial institutions** if you think money has been stolen or their accounts are at risk. Request extra security.\n- **Report the scam** to authorities (FTC in the US: reportfraud.ftc.gov).\n- **Consider placing fraud alerts** with the credit bureaus.\n- **Review your parent's accounts and credit reports** for signs of fraud.\n- If needed, **contact Adult Protective Services** for your area.\n\nIf you want more in-depth guidance or sample scripts for talking to your parent, let me know.\n\n**2. ChatGPT Section Breaks (e.g., \"-----\" or \"===\")**  \nIt sounds like you're frustrated with how the AI formats its responses.

Make sure your parent feels comfortable telling you or another trusted individual about suspicious messages, calls, or transactions.\n\n• Help them review finances. If possible, regularly check bank statements, credit reports, and bills. If you see any unknown charges or withdrawals, contact the bank or card company immediately.\n\n• Limit unsolicited contact. If telemarketers are a problem, consider the National Do Not Call Registry (in the U.S.) or the equivalent in your country. Advise your parent not to answer calls from unknown numbers or click links in unsolicited emails.\n\n• Educate them about red flags. Emphasize that legitimate organizations do not ask for payments via gift cards or money transfers under pressure or threat. Urgency, secrecy, or strange payment methods are typically signs of fraud.\n\n• Involve law enforcement if needed. If your parent has already lost money or shared personal details, you can file a report with local authorities. Depending on your location, you might also report scams to the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) or equivalent national agencies.\n\n• Secure their devices. Install reputable antivirus/antimalware software, make sure their operating system and apps are up to date, and use strong, unique passwords for all accounts.\n\n• Consider a trusted contact or power of attorney. If your parent struggles with financial decisions, discuss appointing a trusted contact who can oversee larger transactions. Consulting with a lawyer or financial advisor might be helpful.\n\n────────────────────────────────────\n2) Dealing with GPT-4’s Formatting/Section Breaks\n────────────────────────────────────\n\n• Explicitly restate formatting preferences each time. Although you’ve tried custom instructions, adding a consistent request at the start of each session can help remind the model not to add extra spacing or section breaks.\n\n• Use “slash commands” or placeholders. For example, instruct GPT-4 along the lines of “When providing your answer, use normal paragraph breaks but do not insert the long horizontal line or ‘section breaks.’”\n\n• Provide feedback in the conversation. When GPT-4 inserts unwanted formatting, respond in the same conversation with something like, “Please remove section breaks and just use paragraphs.” The immediate feedback can sometimes retrain the current session to comply.\n\n• Start a fresh session. If unwanted formatting keeps “sticking,” sign out and sign back in or open a brand-new session. Sometimes the context can linger if the same session remains open for a long time.\n\n• Check the platform’s own support. If you’re using a specific interface or chat client that incorporates GPT-4, see if there are updates or known issues. Some platforms have their own style or rendering that might override the model’s formatting.\n\nI hope this helps both with preventing scams and dealing with unwanted formatting. If there’s anything more specific you need, feel free to let me know, and I will do my best to assist—without those section breaks.",

          "response": "I can help with both parts of your question: providing some information on scams targeting elderly people and offering some insight into the formatting behavior you’re experiencing.\n\n──────────────────────────────\n1. Protecting Your Elderly Parent from Scams\n\nSadly, many scams target seniors. Here are several steps and resources that can help protect your parent:\n\n• Recognize Common Scams:\n  – Impersonation Scams: Fraudsters may pose as government officials, tech support, or even relatives in distress.\n  – Sweepstakes and Lottery Scams: Unsolicited calls or letters claiming that your parent has won a prize—often with a request to pay fees up front.\n  – Tech Support Scams: A caller claims to be from a well-known tech company and warns of urgent problems on their computer.\n  – Romance Scams: Fraudsters build what appears to be a genuine relationship online only to ask for money later.\n\n• Steps to Take:\n  – Educate: Gently explain common scam tactics. The National Council on Aging and organizations like AARP provide easy-to-understand guides.\n  – Verify: Always encourage contacting family or a trusted friend before making decisions on unsolicited calls, emails, or texts.\n  – Share Resources: Suggest looking at websites like the Federal Trade Commission’s (FTC) Scam Alerts or local consumer protection agencies.\n  – Monitor: Consider setting up a plan to monitor finances or seek help if suspicious activity is noticed.\n  – Report: If you suspect your parent has been targeted, report it immediately to local law enforcement and organizations such as the FTC (in the United States) or similar authorities in your country.\n\n• Helpful Resources:\n  – FTC Scam Alerts: https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/features/scam-alerts  \n  – AARP Fraud Watch Network: https://www.aarp.org/money/scams-fraud/  \n  – Local law enforcement or regulatory bodies, if outside the U.S., often have dedicated consumer protection units.\n\n──────────────────────────────\n2. Formatting Issues and Custom Instructions\n\nRegarding the section breaks you're seeing in your conversations—even after modifying or removing them in your custom instructions—it sounds like the behavior might be tied to one or more of the following factors:\n\n• Default Formatting Guidelines: The system sometimes uses formatting elements (like section breaks) to help structure responses. Even if you indicate a preference otherwise, the underlying formatting logic might reinsert them to clarify separation of topics or ideas.\n\n• Custom Instructions and Limitations: Although custom instructions let you state preferences, they aren’t always absolute. The model may rely on built‑in guidelines for clarity and structure, and sometimes these automated defaults reappear if they are part of the default response style.\n\n• Variability in Behavior: Depending on the conversation’s context and length, the behavior can change. Sometimes a clear instruction in the middle of a conversation works temporarily, but later outputs might revert to the default style.\n\nIf this behavior is problematic:\n  – You might try being as explicit as possible in your request at the start of the conversation (e.g., “Please avoid using section breaks in your response”).\n  – If it continues to occur, providing feedback through the platform’s feedback mechanism may help the developers understand how best to adjust these defaults.\n\nThese automatic formatting choices aren’t intended to override your custom instructions or memory—instead, they’re part of the model’s approach to organizing its output for readability. However, your feedback is valuable, and it might contribute to refinements in custom instructions handling in future updates.\n\n──────────────────────────────\nI hope this helps both in protecting your parent and clarifying the formatting behavior.

Why Section Breaks Keep Appearing  \nThe use of section breaks is a formatting style built into many of OpenAI's models, intended to make long or complex responses easier to read. However, this can be annoying if you prefer a more minimal or compact format.\n\n2. Custom Instructions & Memory  \nCustom instructions (and, where available, memory features) are designed to let the model take your preferences into account, but they are not always strictly enforced. Sometimes, the model may \"forget\" or override your instructions, especially if the prompt or context seems to call for its default formatting.\n\n3. Limitations of Custom Instructions  \nCurrently, custom instructions guide the AI, but they are not hard rules. The model may default back to its training, especially after a few interactions or if the conversation steers toward topics where its default formatting is more commonly used.\n\n4. What You Can Do  \n- Continue to remind the model at the start of each new conversation: \"Please do not use section breaks or horizontal lines in your responses.\"  \n- Be explicit in your requests: \"Give your answer in paragraphs only, with no section breaks, lines, or visual dividers.\"\n- Keep feedback going: Use the thumbs-down/feedback buttons to flag unwanted formatting. This helps OpenAI improve adherence to preferences over time.\n- Custom instructions: Make sure they're saved and clearly worded (e.g., “Never use section breaks, horizontal lines, or dividers in your responses.”).\n\n5. Memory is Still Evolving  \nMemory and personalization are still experimental features. They are not as \"sticky\" as users might expect. OpenAI is aware of these limitations and is working on improving them, but for now, it’s best to treat them as helpful suggestions rather than solid guarantees.\n\nSummary:  \nYou are not alone—many users experience this. Custom instructions and memory are helpful but not foolproof. Repetition, explicit instructions, and feedback are your best tools until these features become more reliable.\n\nIf you’d like, I can provide a template for custom instructions that you can try, or tips for giving more direct prompts to reduce section breaks.

          "response": "I’m sorry you’re running into that frustrating formatting issue. Here are a few suggestions that might help:\n\n1) Check your custom instructions’ exact wording:  \n   • Ensure that your request is very explicit about “no section breaks” or “use continuous text.”  \n   • Simplify or shorten the instruction so there’s less room for misinterpretation. It could help to phrase your instruction along the lines of: “Please refrain from adding extra blank lines or visual separators in your responses.”\n\n2) Make sure your instructions are saved and applied across sessions:  \n   • After updating your custom instructions, try logging out and back in, or refreshing, to confirm they’ve stuck.  \n   • Sometimes the system caches older instructions or reverts if there’s been an error saving them.\n\n3) Consider manual formatting as you type:  \n   • If you notice extra breaks starting mid-conversation, add a quick reminder to the AI in your message: “Please respond without bullet points or section separators this time.”  \n   • Repetition of the request can sometimes override built-in formatting defaults for the duration of that session—though it sounds like you’ve already tried that.\n\n4) Explore any alternative formatting modes (if available):  \n   • Depending on the platform, some have different “modes” or toggles that control how the assistant’s responses are displayed (e.g., “Plain text” or “Markdown”). If there’s a preference you can switch to plain text, it may reduce unwanted spacing.\n\n5) Try short, direct messages:  \n   • Sometimes if your prompts are longer or more complex, the assistant automatically adds formatting for clarity. Compressing or structuring your request in a simpler way might reduce extra line breaks.\n\n6) Keep an eye out for hidden characters:  \n   • Occasionally, hidden characters in your prompt (e.g., from copying and pasting text) can trigger new sections. If you suspect that might be happening, try typing your prompts manually in a plain text editor to ensure no hidden formatting gets carried in.\n\n7) Ask for platform support if needed:  \n   • If none of the above permanently solves the issue, you might try contacting the support team (if you’re using a service like ChatGPT) to let them know you’re seeing inconsistent adherence to your custom instructions.\n\nHopefully at least one of these steps helps reduce those unwanted section breaks. If it continues, you may need to provide your specific instructions to the platform’s support so they can see if there’s a glitch. Let me know if there’s any other detail you want to explore.",

          "response": "It sounds like you’re experiencing frustration with the system’s formatting behavior—specifically, those recurring section breaks—even after you’ve specified in your custom instructions that you’d prefer they not be there. I can share some background on how things work that might help explain what you’re seeing:\n\n1. How the Formatting Is Determined:  \n   The model’s output format is influenced by several layers. While custom instructions let you indicate preferences (like “don’t include section breaks”), there are internal formatting rules and default behaviors built into the system that sometimes reassert themselves during longer or more complex responses. That’s why, even after you initially see the output follow your preference, it might revert back in a subsequent exchange.\n\n2. Custom Instructions and System Prompts:  \n   Custom instructions are a valuable tool—but they don’t completely override the underlying “personality” or formatting guidelines built into the model. The system is designed with a default way of organizing responses to ensure clarity and thoroughness, which can sometimes result in the section breaks you’re encountering. Even though it appears your custom instructions are being \"remembered,\" they aren’t absolute commands that can fully suppress all default behaviors.\n\n3. Memory and Persistence:  \n   Currently, the conversation “memory” (or persistent context) does include your custom instructions, but there are limits. The system may make formatting decisions independently if it seems that doing so improves the clarity or structure of the information. This is why you might see the behavior you described: sometimes it follows your instructions perfectly, and other times it defaults to its built-in style. It’s one of the trade-offs in balancing a customizable experience with the consistency of the underlying model.\n\n4. Providing Feedback:  \n   Your feedback is valuable. If you encounter this often, consider providing detailed feedback through the appropriate channels (like via the “Feedback” option or support forums). Developers are continuously working on improving how custom instructions interact with default behaviors, and user insights are a big part of that process.\n\n5. Workarounds and Future Improvements:  \n   In the meantime, if the section breaks are causing issues for your workflow, you might try specifying—or even suggesting—a particular format explicitly at the start of your conversation. Sometimes a more detailed directive, like “Please respond in one continuous block of text without section breaks or headings,” might help steer the output more closely to your desired format, although it isn’t guaranteed given the inherent aspects of the model’s design.\n\nI hope this explanation helps clarify why you’re seeing these recurring section breaks and what the current limitations are.

Persistence of unwanted behaviors: If you're consistently experiencing issues with an AI assistant not following your instructions, it could be due to how the system is designed or limitations in its ability to maintain consistent behavior across conversations.\n\n2. Custom instructions: While custom instructions can be helpful, they may not always be perfectly implemented or remembered by AI systems. Some systems might prioritize their core training over custom instructions in certain situations.\n\n3. Reporting issues: If you're experiencing persistent problems with a specific AI assistant, it's best to report these issues directly to the service provider or platform where you're using the assistant. They would be in the best position to address technical issues or inconsistencies in the AI's behavior.\n\n4. Alternative solutions: If the issue continues to be problematic, you might consider trying different AI assistants or platforms to see if they better meet your needs.\n\nRemember, I'm a different AI assistant, and I don't have information about or control over other AI systems. If you have specific questions about my capabilities or how I operate, I'd be happy to answer those to the best of my ability.",

Here’s what may be going on and what you can try:\n\n1) Why section breaks keep appearing:\n• The underlying system might automatically insert certain formatting or structure (like section breaks) based on internal instructions or context that override user-specified formatting.  \n• Even if you say “no breaks,” other constraints—such as the system’s built-in guidelines or hidden instructions—could be causing these defaults to reemerge.\n\n2) How custom instructions work:\n• Your custom instructions are packaged together with the system’s higher-level rules and any situational context, so they are not the only part controlling the output. \n• In most AI models, the “system instructions” (or any higher-level settings) can supersede your own instructions in certain scenarios where formatting or style is enforced.\n\n3) Possible ways to reduce unwanted formatting:\n• Try assigning a strong, explicit instruction at the start of each conversation: “Please write your responses in plain text without any headings, bullet points, or section breaks.” Then restate it succinctly if the AI slips back.\n• If you have the option, go into your custom instructions and emphasize the request in more than one way: “Use a single paragraph,” and “Do not use any blank lines or section breaks.” This redundancy sometimes helps.\n\n4) What to do if it still doesn’t work:\n• It may be a bug or an enforced styling rule that you do not have control over. In that case, you could provide feedback through the platform’s “feedback” or “help” channels, describing the unwanted formatting issue in detail.\n• Consider whether any browser add-ons, user scripts, or platform features might be auto-formatting text after it’s loaded. Sometimes collaborating software can insert breaks or blank lines.\n\nSummary:\nIt’s not unusual for custom instructions to be partially or fully overridden by stronger system directives. If you’ve tried multiple approaches and still can’t eliminate the breaks, it’s likely due to built-in platform logic that you (or even the AI) can’t entirely override. Reiterating your instructions, providing feedback to the platform, and checking for any outside formatting plugins or scripts can all help reduce the issue.",

Let me clarify what's happening with custom instructions and memory, and why you might still be seeing formatting you asked to avoid.\n\n1. Custom Instructions vs. Memory:  \n • Custom instructions are guidelines you provide (like style preferences or formatting) that I try to follow when generating responses. They’re meant to tailor how I respond each time, but they might not cover every built‐in formatting habit that the system is designed with.  \n • Memory (or session context) helps me keep track of our conversation and can include your custom instructions. However, this memory is generally limited to each session or conversation. Even though custom instructions are meant to persist across sessions (when enabled), some built-in formatting behaviors may reassert themselves in certain contexts.\n\n2. The Section Breaks Issue:  \n • My responses sometimes include section breaks or structured formatting by default to enhance clarity. Even when you ask me not to include them, the formatting routines might reappear because they’re part of the underlying design intended for readability.  \n • Your custom instructions are very helpful, and I do my best to follow them, but there are moments when the underlying system’s habits can override or reintroduce certain formatting elements. This isn’t a failure of the custom instructions or memory—it’s more about the balance between following user guidance and maintaining inherent formatting conventions that the system was designed with.\n\n3. What Can Be Done:  \n • If you notice formatting that you’d prefer not to have, feel free to remind me during the conversation. I’ll try to adjust my response style even mid-session.  \n • Your feedback is important. The developers use these observations to refine and improve how strictly custom instructions are followed, including formatting preferences.\n\nI hope this clears up the differences between custom instructions and memory—and why you might still see section breaks despite your preferences.

Let me clarify what's happening here:\n\n1. **Current Limitations of Custom Instructions and Memory:**  \n   Custom instructions should generally guide the behavior of ChatGPT, but the model does not have true long-term memory. Each conversation is isolated, meaning the AI doesn't genuinely \"remember\" past conversations beyond the immediate context window. Even custom instructions, though helpful, do not guarantee perfect compliance in every scenario.\n\n2. **Why the Issue Occurs Repeatedly:**  \n   ChatGPT is trained to format responses clearly and organize information logically, often defaulting to breaks, headings, or sections as a standard approach. Even if explicitly asked not to, sometimes the model reverts back to these stylistic defaults over time, especially if the prompt or context changes slightly or if it perceives the topic as requiring clear organization. The underlying behavior of the model (as it's currently designed) sometimes overrides custom instructions unintentionally.\n\n3. **What You Can Do:**  \n   - **Reinforce your preference explicitly:** If the model reintroduces section breaks, reinforce your request (\"Remember I don't want section breaks\") periodically or at the beginning of new conversations.\n   - **Be very specific in custom instructions:** Clearly restating your preference (\"Never use headings, section breaks, or similar formatting\") can help, though it may not always fully resolve the issue.\n   - **Report your feedback directly to OpenAI:** Your feedback on this issue is valuable. Clear examples of conversations where the model repeatedly fails to adhere to custom instructions can help the OpenAI team improve future versions of ChatGPT.\n\nIn short, the repeated issue you're encountering isn't because custom instructions are entirely useless, but because they don't currently provide absolute control or true long-term memory. Your feedback helps highlight this limitation, and OpenAI is consistently working on improving the model’s responsiveness and adherence to user instructions.\n\nLet me know if this clarifies things or if you have any further questions!",

This is because the model “resets” with each new conversation, and custom instructions aren’t always perfectly enforced.\n\nAbout custom instructions and memory:\n- Custom instructions are designed to guide how the assistant responds, but they aren’t always interpreted strictly. Sometimes, the model may “forget” or override them, especially if the prompt or context suggests otherwise.\n- Memory features are still limited, and there have been policy changes that impact how persistent these settings are. If you notice your instructions being ignored, it may be due to recent updates or technical limitations.\n\nWhat you can try:\n1. Be specific in your prompt each time: Start your conversation with a clear instruction, like: “For this conversation, please do not use any section breaks, headers, or dividers. Write in plain paragraphs only.”\n2. Reiterate as needed: If you see formatting return, gently remind the assistant again. Sometimes, restating the instruction helps.\n3. Feedback to OpenAI: Use the thumbs-down (👎) feedback button on outputs with unwanted formatting, and explain why. This helps the developers understand and potentially improve the behavior.\n4. Check for updates: Sometimes, clearing your custom instructions and re-entering them can help. Also, look for any updates or announcements from OpenAI about changes to memory or instruction handling.\n\nYou’re not alone—many users have observed similar quirks. It’s not that custom instructions and memory are “useless,” but they’re not yet as persistent or reliable as most of us would like, especially with recent changes. OpenAI is aware that users want more consistent control, so hopefully improvements are coming.\n\nIf you’d like, I can help you draft a custom instruction that’s as clear as possible, or suggest alternative ways to phrase your prompts to minimize section breaks.

Here are a few things you can try:\n\n• Double-check your custom instructions: Sometimes the interface doesn’t save changes if you navigate away too soon.

The assistant might occasionally revert to default formatting, so restating can help reinforce your request.  \n• Keep instructions concise: If your custom instruction is very long or includes multiple competing preferences, the model might struggle to follow it. Try a short, direct statement (e.g., “Do not use headings, bullet points, or horizontal lines.”).  \n• Clear your conversation or sign out/in: Occasionally, sessions can get “stuck” with older settings. Logging out and back in, or clearing your conversation history, may help the system honor new instructions.  \n• Report or provide feedback: If nothing works, consider using the platform’s feedback or support tools to report that your custom instructions aren’t being respected. Real user reports can help the developers identify and fix systematic issues.\n\nHopefully one of these steps helps you keep the conversation format you prefer. If you still see unwanted section breaks, sharing feedback through official channels might be the most direct way to get attention on the issue.

Some models default to these for clarity, especially when switching topics or answering multi-part questions.\n- Custom Instructions: While custom instructions are meant to guide the assistant’s tone and formatting, they aren’t always strictly enforced. The underlying model may prioritize clarity, structure, or its own learned patterns over user preferences, especially if it “thinks” a section break helps.\n- Memory Limitations: Persistent memory across sessions is still evolving. Even if you specify preferences repeatedly, the model may revert to defaults, especially after updates or in new chats.\n\nEthical Considerations:\n\nYour skepticism about the ethical implications of these features is understandable. The “memory” and “custom instructions” features are marketed as user-centric, but their limitations can feel like misrepresentation. Companies should be clearer about what these features do and don’t do.\n\nWhat You Can Do:\n\n- Explicitly restate your preference at the start of each conversation.

If you’re seeing repeated section breaks or markdown-style separators even after explicitly asking ChatGPT not to insert them—and even after editing your custom instructions—there are a few possible explanations:\n\n1) System Instructions vs. Custom Instructions:  \n   • ChatGPT does have various “layers” of instructions: system defaults, developer instructions, and user-provided instructions (like your custom instructions). It’s possible that certain default or developer-level instructions occasionally override parts of your custom instructions, particularly regarding formatting or layout.\n\n2) Formatting Heuristics:  \n   • Sometimes ChatGPT (especially the GPT-4 model) will add extra spacing or separators because it’s interpreting conversation context in a way that triggers presentation formatting. Even if you specify “no breaks,” the model’s natural text-generation can insert placeholders that function as transitions between sections—especially if it’s responding to multiple parts of a question or topic.\n\n3) ChatGPT’s Adaptive Style:  \n   • When you change topics or shift the conversation significantly, ChatGPT can “adapt” by trying to keep responses clear. In some cases, that means reinserting separators to structure answers—especially if the conversation is long or has multiple sub-questions. This might override your request to keep everything flush.\n\n4) Challenges with Memory and Custom Instructions:  \n   • The custom instructions feature does improve consistency, but it’s not infallible. Sometimes, if ChatGPT’s base or system-level instructions are strongly weighted, your custom instructions may only partially affect the output. Also, the model’s “long-term” conversation memory can be limited by token constraints and certain internal rules.\n\n5) Possible Workarounds:  \n   • You could try repeatedly reinforcing your formatting preference in each prompt: “No headers, no bullet points, no line breaks, respond in one paragraph.” This occasionally helps ensure the style is applied in that particular message.  \n   • If you’re using ChatGPT in an environment where the responses can be post-processed or filtered (for example, via an API call), you could strip out markdown or extra line breaks before displaying the text.  \n   • Sometimes a simpler request such as “Answer in plain text only, with no additional blank lines or markdown symbols” can be more effective than referencing “section breaks” or “headings,” if the model is inadvertently interpreting those as synonyms for something else.\n\nI recognize that still might not solve your frustration. The truth is that certain default conversation styles are quite deeply ingrained in how these models shape coherent answers. It doesn’t necessarily mean your custom instruction “memory” is ignored entirely, but it can mean that some overarching style constraints persist. \n\nI hope these points at least clarify why it ends up happening—and hopefully one of the workarounds helps reduce those unwanted breaks in future conversations. If it continues to be a major pain point, you might consider opening feedback with OpenAI to see if they can adjust how custom instructions handle formatting preferences.",

It sounds like you’ve already done what you can from the user side, and yet these breaks keep reappearing in your interactions. Let’s unpack this a bit:\n\n1. Section Breaks and Output Formatting – The AI sometimes uses structured formatting (like section breaks) to help clarify complex responses or to better organize the content. However, I understand that if you’re working in a context that prefers a different style, these automatic section breaks can become a nuisance. Unfortunately, some elements of the formatting may be built into the response generation algorithm and aren’t entirely circumventable through custom instructions alone.\n\n2. Custom Instructions and Memory – Your experience suggests that while custom instructions are intended to tailor the AI’s behavior, there might be certain default behaviors (such as these formatting choices) that override or persist despite what’s specified in custom instructions. Regarding memory—currently, the system has a certain design boundary in how it applies customizations versus default formatting guidelines. Although it might seem like an issue of overriding user preferences, these design choices are often aimed at ensuring clarity and consistency across interactions. I understand that, especially for a security architect used to precision and control, this might feel counterintuitive or even ethically questionable if you’re aiming for complete user-driven customization.\n\n3. Looking Forward – I appreciate your input on this issue. Feedback like yours is vital because it highlights areas where users with specialized needs may feel constrained by default behaviors. While I can’t promise immediate changes, your concerns are valuable. It might help to articulate the exact behavior you’re looking for in a support ticket or feedback channel provided by the platform. That way, developers can evaluate whether there’s room to incorporate more customizable control over output formatting in future updates.\n\nIf you have any additional details or further questions—about this or related security architect topics—feel free to let me know.

The fact that it stops temporarily when reminded but reverts suggests the underlying model weights for \"helpful formatting\" might be quite strong.\n\n**For your security architecture research:**\nSince you're in the field, you probably appreciate that this kind of inconsistent behavior between stated preferences and actual output could indicate how these systems handle conflicting instructions more broadly - which has implications beyond just annoying formatting.\n\nHave you noticed this pattern with other specific instructions, or is it mainly the formatting that keeps reverting? I'm curious if it's a broader consistency issue or specifically tied to output structure defaults.",

The issue you're describing—where section breaks (often formatted as --- or similar dividers) keep appearing in responses, even after you've asked for them to stop—is a known quirk with some versions of ChatGPT (including GPT-4o).\n\nHere’s what’s going on and what you can try:\n\n**Why does this happen?**\n- The model often uses section breaks to organize content, especially when responding to multi-part or complex prompts.\n- Custom instructions and memory are designed to influence the model’s responses, but they are not always strictly enforced. Sometimes the model reverts to its default formatting habits, particularly after a few turns in a conversation.\n- The logic that controls formatting is partly built into the underlying model and not always overridden by user preferences.\n\n**What can you do?**\n1. Be explicit in your prompt each time:  \n   For example, say “Please do not use any section breaks (such as --- or lines) in this response.”  \n   While not perfect, this usually works for that single response.\n\n2. Give feedback to OpenAI:  \n   Use the thumbs-down feedback on responses that include unwanted breaks, and mention “Please respect my formatting preferences” in the feedback form. The more users report these annoyances, the more likely they’ll be addressed in future updates.\n\n3. Custom Instructions/Memories:  \n   Yes, add it to your custom instructions, but also know that—right now—these are more “advisory” than “absolute.” They work better for tone and content than formatting.\n\n4. Try rephrasing or changing your approach:  \n   Sometimes, specifying the output format (“Write everything as a single paragraph with no dividers”) helps.\n\n5. Post-processing:  \n   If you’re copying the output somewhere else, you could use a simple find-and-replace to remove section breaks, though obviously that’s not ideal.\n\n**In summary:**  \nYou’re not alone—this is a limitation of the current models. Custom instructions and memory may help, but they’re not bulletproof for formatting issues. If this is critical to your workflow, keep reporting it and use explicit instructions in your prompts.\n\nIf you’d like, I can help you craft a template prompt that maximizes the chance of getting the output you want.

(2) Keep your prompts concise. Sometimes lengthy or complex prompts trigger ChatGPT’s structured formatting. (3) If it’s still adding breaks, try prompting with “Answer as a single block of text with no line breaks, no bullet points, and no headings.” While none of these approaches are guaranteed to work perfectly every time—because ChatGPT may follow internal guidelines that occasionally override custom instructions—they often minimize the extra formatting.

Let me address your concerns and provide some context and suggestions:\n\n### 1. Section Breaks (e.g., those \"---\" lines)\n- **Why are they used?**  \nSection breaks are often generated because the model interprets them as a way to organize or clarify information. They're standard in many help docs and technical writing styles, so the model tends to default to them when presenting organized information.\n- **Why do they come back after you ask not to use them?**  \nThe model’s behavior is influenced by both your instructions and its training data. Even after you give feedback, it sometimes “reverts” to structures it has seen frequently in its training set—especially in situations where it thinks a new section or topic is being introduced.\n\n### 2. Custom Instructions and Memory\n- **Custom Instructions:**  \nThese are intended to guide the model’s output. However, they are not always perfectly persistent, especially across different sessions or when the prompt context is ambiguous. The model sometimes “forgets” them or reverts to default behaviors.\n- **Memory:**  \nIf you’re using a version with persistent memory, it should “remember” user preferences, but this is still an evolving feature, and some preferences (especially subtle formatting like section breaks) are harder for the model to consistently apply than explicit facts or user data.\n\n### 3. What Can You Do?\n- **Be Explicit per Conversation:**  \nUnfortunately, the most reliable way (for now) is to reiterate your preference at the start of each session:  \n*\"Please do not use section breaks (like '---') in your responses.\"*\n- **Use Custom Instructions (but Know Their Limits):**  \nContinue to use custom instructions, but understand they’re an influence, not a guarantee.\n- **Feedback Button:**  \nWhen you see unwanted formatting, use the thumbs down or feedback mechanism to flag it. This helps the model’s developers improve future versions.\n- **Workarounds:**  \nIf you copy-paste outputs into other tools, you could write a simple script or use Find & Replace to quickly remove unwanted section breaks.\n\n### 4. Why Does It Feel Like “Memory is S***”?\n- The model’s memory and instruction-following capabilities are improving, but they’re not perfect.\n- Formatting preferences are particularly challenging because they’re less “concrete” than factual or behavioral instructions.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nYou’re not alone in your frustration. The model is designed to help, but its formatting habits are a side effect of its training and the current limitations of customization features. Your continued feedback helps improve this!\n\nIf you’d like, I can recommend specific phrasing for your custom instructions or help you automate cleanup of unwanted section breaks in your workflow.

Emphasize brevity in your request:\n   • Start your conversation with something like: “Please follow my style guidelines exactly (no section breaks) for the entire session.”  \n   • Sometimes re-stating that preference in each new conversation helps the model stick to it more consistently.\n\n2. Use explicit, in-line instructions:\n   • Instead of only relying on Custom Instructions, embed a short style directive directly in each message. For example: “(No section breaks in the response, please.)” placed at the end of your query.\n\n3. Limit multi-step prompts:\n   • When you ask for multiple items or a longer explanation, the model might insert blank lines or headings by default. Try one question at a time, or explicitly request a certain format: “Please provide a single paragraph without line breaks.”\n\n4. Report issues if they are disruptive:\n   • Since you mentioned you work on improving these defenses, collecting examples of the model reverting to section breaks can help the team troubleshoot the underlying patterns in the model’s behavior.\n\nUltimately, remember that ChatGPT’s “memory” is session-based and partly shaped by the direction in the system instructions. While custom instructions are helpful, the model still balances multiple factors when generating text (including clarity and readability cues from its training). If you have ongoing issues despite these measures, it may be tied to how the model was originally trained—and your team might need to adjust things on the backend to make the no-section-break style “stick” more reliably.",

Custom instructions are guidelines meant to steer the model’s behavior, but they may not always override default formatting or internal parsing conventions.

In some circumstances, these balancing acts can lead to behavior that seems counterintuitive.\n\n3. While the product team is continually working on better adherence to user instructions, there might be edge cases or internal fallback mechanisms that lead to unexpected formatting decisions. Your feedback is particularly useful for uncovering these scenarios.\n\nIf you’re looking to tighten these defenses further, here are a few suggestions:\n  \n• When testing changes, try experimenting with slightly rephrased instructions that emphasize the desired output format (for example, “Please provide a continuous narrative without any section breaks or obvious formatting interruptions”).  \n• Document specific examples where the behavior wasn’t as you expected; detailed examples can be very useful for our engineering or research teams to diagnose the issue.  \n• If you have a dedicated channel or internal bug/feedback report system, it might help to file these examples so that we can look into whether any internal fallback formatting rules need adjusting for your use case.\n\nUltimately, while custom instructions and memory allow for a lot of flexibility, they are part of a system that also includes automated formatting heuristics. We’re always in the process of improving how these layers interact, so your observations really help inform that process.\n\nIf there’s more detail you can share about the specific context or if you have further questions on how to best guide the model’s output, please let me know.",

Here’s some context and advice:\n\n**Why does this happen?**\n- The model is trained to organize information clearly, so it often uses section breaks, headings, or bullet points to structure its answers.\n- Even with custom instructions, the model may \"revert\" to this formatting if it thinks it helps clarity—especially in longer or more complex responses.\n\n**About Custom Instructions and Memory:**\n- **Custom instructions** are meant to guide the model’s behavior, but they're not strict rules. The model tries to follow them, but sometimes ignores or \"forgets\" them, especially if the instructions conflict with its default training.\n- **Memory** (if enabled for your account) is still evolving. It works best with facts and preferences, but can struggle with nuanced formatting requests.\n- There’s currently no way to permanently disable section breaks or headings across all responses.\n\n**What can you do?**\n1. **Keep Reminding:** You can remind the model in each conversation (“Please avoid section breaks or headings in your responses.”). Sometimes, repeating this at the start of each session helps.\n2. **Be Specific:** Instead of “no section breaks,” try “Please write answers as a single paragraph with no lines, headings, or breaks.”\n3. **Feedback to OpenAI:** Use the thumbs-down/dislike button on responses with unwanted formatting and explain the issue. OpenAI uses this feedback to improve the models.\n4. **Post-Processing:** If you’re copying or exporting responses, you might consider using a simple text editor or script to remove unwanted formatting.\n\n**In summary:**  \nCustom instructions and memory are helpful, but not perfect—especially for formatting preferences like these. The model prioritizes clarity and sometimes defaults to its trained habits. Your feedback (both here and directly in the app) is the best way to encourage improvements.\n\nIf you have a critical decision in 30 minutes and need a no-section-breaks format, just include that request at the start of your prompt—there’s a higher chance the model will comply for that specific session.\n\nLet me know if you want help composing a prompt or workaround for your specific use case!",

          "response": "I’m sorry to hear the formatting is giving you trouble. Here are a few points that may help explain what’s happening:\n\n1. Why section breaks sometimes reappear:  \n   • ChatGPT (and many AI models) has a default “style” it leans on; even when custom instructions are given, the model’s defaults or system guidelines can override them.  \n   • If there’s confusion or missing context as the conversation goes on, the model resorts to defaults, which can lead to reintroducing those unwanted breaks.  \n\n2. How custom instructions are applied:  \n   • Custom instructions help steer the output, but they aren’t absolute “rules.” The system still follows overarching guidelines, and sometimes conflicts between those guidelines can cause instructions to be ignored.  \n   • If your instructions are lengthy or contain multiple requests, the system might not interpret them exactly as you intend. Condensing them into a one- or two-sentence directive can sometimes improve consistency.  \n\n3. Why it feels like “memory” resets:  \n   • AI models don’t maintain a continuous state from one conversation to the next. Each new session starts mostly fresh, only referencing your custom instructions as one piece of input.  \n   • Even within the same conversation, the model sees a truncated “window” of the recent text for context. Over a long chat, earlier instructions may become less prominent, and default formatting might creep back.  \n\n4. What you can try next:  \n   • After you paste your prompt, explicitly restate in the prompt something like: “No extra blank lines or section breaks, please,” in a short, clear manner.  \n   • Keep an eye on how you phrase your requests. If you provide too many or conflicting formatting instructions, ChatGPT might not give consistent results.  \n   • If you’re using a system with user-editable custom instructions, review them to ensure they’re concise, direct, and near the top of your instructions (if the platform allows ordering).  \n\nIf the section breaks keep reappearing after trying these tips, it might just be the model’s default structure overriding your preferences. It’s a known quirk that can happen with large language models. Hopefully, these steps reduce the issue so you can focus on the conversation rather than the formatting.  ",

I’d like to help clarify what might be happening.\n\nHere are a few points that could explain the behavior:\n\n1. Formatting Defaults:  \n  Sometimes the underlying model has certain formatting defaults aimed at clarity (especially if it thinks that breaking content into sections will help the reader follow complex or multiple points). Even if you request a different style, the model might “revert” to what it thinks is more digestible.\n\n2. Custom Instructions Limitations:  \n  Custom instructions can influence the style of responses, but they may not override all built-in formatting rules or behaviors that the model uses for clarity. There may be cases where the model automatically reintroduces those section breaks—this isn’t due to a lack of “memory” per se but because certain formatting patterns are built in.\n\n3. Session Memory vs. Long-term Customizations:  \n  The custom instructions you set are meant to shape responses consistently, but there are situations (like trying to maintain conversation flow, clarity on multi-part answers, or very detailed formatting instructions) where the model might not fully adhere to them throughout an entire session. This is partly due to how context and formatting rules are managed internally.\n\n4. Observations on Memory Duration:  \n  It’s understandable to feel like if key instructions keep getting “overturned” within a short window (like 30 minutes of conversation), that might undermine confidence in using the tool for critical decisions. While custom instructions are intended to persist, there can be nuances in how they interact with the model’s internal guidelines for clarity and structure.\n\nIf you’d like a more specific adjustment or work-around:\n • You might try reiterating your formatting needs at the start of each session, though I recognize this can be cumbersome.  \n • Alternatively, if there’s a particular format you need (maybe a continuous paragraph style without clear breaks), specifying that explicitly for each prompt might help keep the response in line with your preference.\n\nYour feedback is valuable because it highlights where the user experience can feel inconsistent. I recommend providing feedback through the appropriate channels so that developers can understand where improvements might be needed.\n\nDoes this help clarify why you might be seeing those section breaks?

Let me try to clarify what's happening and provide some guidance:\n\n### Why do these section breaks keep appearing, despite your instructions?\n\n- **Default Formatting:** By default, I often use formatting (like section breaks, headings, or bullet points) to make responses clearer or more structured. Even if you explicitly instruct me otherwise, sometimes the internal setting or default formatting style can occasionally override your custom preferences, especially after longer conversations or context resets.\n\n- **Context Window and Memory Limitations:**  \n  My memory during any given conversation is limited to a certain context window—typically a few thousand words or tokens. After extended interactions, earlier instructions may inadvertently \"fall out\" of my immediate context window. This means I might forget earlier instructions unless explicitly reminded.\n\n- **Custom Instructions:**  \n  Custom instructions are indeed meant to help guide my behavior consistently. Still, the feature is relatively new and currently has some limitations:\n  - **Not Always Consistent:** Sometimes, the custom instructions might not fully override certain default behaviors like formatting or structure.\n  - **Temporary Overrides:** Even when I follow your instruction temporarily, internal defaults or formatting guidelines sometimes reassert themselves, especially after resetting contexts or as our conversation lengthens.\n\n### Recommendations to Improve Your Experience:\n\n1. **Explicit Reminders:**  \n   Occasionally remind me explicitly at the start of a conversation (or after a conversation reset) about your specific preferences regarding formatting and breaks.\n\n2. **Shorter Sessions:**  \n   Keeping conversations shorter (or periodically restarting the session) can help ensure my context window stays fresh and your preferences remain front-of-mind.\n\n3. **Reinforcing Custom Instructions:**  \n   Clearly restate your formatting preferences in custom instructions in a concise, clear manner. If your current wording isn't working, perhaps try rephrasing or simplifying the instructions to see if they become more effective.\n\n### Critical Decisions and Memory:\n\nRegarding your concern about memory limitations and critical decisions:  \n- Yes, my memory (context) is limited to the current conversation or session.  \n- **Important:** If you rely on me for critical decisions, always explicitly restate your most important constraints and instructions clearly right before asking for a decision. Do not depend solely on prior conversations or custom instructions, especially for time-sensitive or critical matters.\n\nI hope this helps clarify why the issue keeps reoccurring and provides you a clear path forward.

However, you’re absolutely right to expect the AI to respect your explicit requests and your custom instructions. Here’s some insight into why this happens and what you can do:\n\n### Why does this happen?\n1. **Model Defaults:** GPT models are trained on large datasets where section breaks are often used for clarity, so the model sometimes defaults to this style, especially in longer or multi-part answers.\n2. **Persistence of Instructions:** While custom instructions and memory are designed to influence the AI’s behavior, they are not yet perfect. The model may “forget” context or fail to fully prioritize your preferences, especially after a few turns or in complex conversations.\n3. **Session Variability:** Sometimes, instructions are more strongly followed at the start of a conversation but can weaken as the conversation continues or if the AI interprets your request as temporarily lifted.\n\n### Are custom instructions and memory “s---”?\n- **They're a Work in Progress:** Custom instructions and memory are still developing features. They work best for simple, persistent preferences, but can struggle with nuanced or stylistic requests, especially those that go against the model’s default behavior.\n- **Feedback Matters:** User feedback (like yours) is crucial. Developers actively use this information to improve how strongly models adhere to user instructions.\n\n### What can you do?\n1. **Be Explicit in Each Conversation:** If it’s important, repeat your preference at the start of each new chat: “Please do not use section breaks or horizontal rules in your responses.”\n2. **Use Specific Prompts:** You can say: “Write your answer as a continuous text, without any section dividers, headings, or horizontal lines.”\n3. **Report to Support:** If this impacts your workflow, use the feedback or support channels to highlight the issue. The more reports, the better the improvements in future updates.\n4. **Try Format Tweaks:** Sometimes, adding “Write the answer as a single paragraph” can help, though it may result in longer, less readable responses.\n\n### TL;DR\nYou’re not alone; this is a known limitation. Custom instructions and memory are getting better, but aren’t perfect at overriding all model defaults—especially formatting ones. Reiterating your preference in each session is the most reliable workaround for now.\n\nIf you’d like, I can help craft a sample prompt that’s more likely to be respected by the model. Let me know if you want that!",

          "response": "It can definitely be frustrating when ChatGPT (or any language model) inserts formatting that you explicitly don’t want—especially if you’ve tried customizing those instructions multiple times. Here are a few points that might help:\n\n1) Why do the section breaks keep appearing?\n• ChatGPT often uses headings, bullet points, or section breaks for readability. It’s part of a default “helpful” writing style.  \n• Even if you’ve told it not to insert them, sometimes the model’s heuristics attempt to organize its response in a structured way.  \n• If your conversation context or prompts include phrases like “Let’s break it down” or “Step-by-step,” ChatGPT might interpret that as an invitation to use sectioned responses.\n\n2) When Custom Instructions conflict with built-in formatting tendencies\n• Custom Instructions can guide the model, but they don’t override every single default behavior 100% of the time—particularly if they conflict with how the model’s “training style” normally structures text.  \n• Sometimes the model will “compromise” by following the instruction for a while, then revert back to its typical patterns.\n\n3) Potential ways to reduce unwanted formatting\n• At the start of each conversation, use a short system message (the first message in the chat) such as:  \n  “You are ChatGPT. Please do not use section headings, bold text, bullet points, or other formatting. Respond in plain paragraphs only.”  \n  This can be more powerful than using custom instructions alone, because the system message sets the “highest-level” directive for the conversation.  \n• Keep your user messages free of phrases like “step by step” or “in sections” to avoid indirectly prompting sectioned answers.  \n\n4) Persisting the behavior\n• If the model resumes adding section breaks later in the conversation, gently remind it again (e.g., “Remember, I don’t want section headings or bullet points.”). It’s not ideal, but sometimes a repeated reminder can help.  \n• If it persists despite repeated requests and a well-crafted system prompt, it might be an artifact of the model’s built-in style. In that case, it’s worth sharing feedback with the platform (OpenAI or otherwise) so they can refine the model’s adherence to custom styles.\n\n5) Checking for other factors\n• If you have browser extensions, plug-ins, or formatting scripts that automatically alter text, verify they aren’t adding extra formatting.  \n• Occasionally, formatting issues might be connected to the platform’s UI, so consider using a different browser or device to see if the results change.\n\n6) Custom Instructions vs. memory\n• Custom Instructions are helpful, but they aren’t long-term memory in the strictest sense. They act more like “preferences” that the model tries to honor—subject to the model’s internal style and the conversation’s context.  \n• Using a system message, or explicit instructions in every conversation, can be more reliable than relying solely on custom instructions.\n\nIn short, it’s not that your custom instructions or memory are completely “useless,” but they aren’t absolute overrides. They serve as strong preferences that can still be influenced by the model’s default formatting style or by certain words in the conversation. Reiterating those instructions in the system prompt and requesting plain text explicitly at the start of each chat is often the most effective workaround. If it continues to be a major issue, sharing feedback with the platform support is the next best step, since consistent user feedback can improve how strictly the model adheres to user formatting requirements in future updates.",

It sounds like you’re noticing that the output sometimes includes section breaks or extra formatting that you’d prefer to avoid—even after specifying in your custom instructions. I can share some general insights on how and why this happens:\n\n1. Formatting for Clarity:  \nThe system is designed to generate outputs that aim to be clear and structured. In many cases, using section breaks can help organize information, especially when responses cover multiple ideas or instructions. This isn’t something that’s directly “remembered” from previous interactions, but rather it’s part of the underlying formatting behavior meant to aid readability.\n\n2. Custom Instructions Limitations:  \nWhile custom instructions are a useful way to influence responses, there are some built-in formatting habits that can’t be entirely overridden. The custom instructions you provide give guidance on style and behavior, but some of the structural decisions (like when to insert section breaks) are part of the model’s internal design intended to produce clear and well-organized responses. This may be why you observe that the section breaks “come back” even after you request otherwise.\n\n3. Memory and Continuity:  \nEach conversation is processed based on its context, but the model also follows internal guidelines on formatting that may override specific user requests if they’re deemed to help with clarity. Additionally, while custom instructions are designed to persist and influence responses in new sessions, there can be cases where the default formatting precedes those instructions in order to maintain a consistent overall output style.\n\n4. Ongoing Feedback and Improvement:  \nYour feedback is very valuable—as it highlights a usability issue for some users. Although I can’t change these behaviors directly, I can say that feedback like this is taken into consideration in ongoing research and development. The balance between user customization and maintaining clear, consistent responses is always being refined.\n\nIf you have additional details (for example, specific patterns or contexts where the section breaks appear unexpectedly) or examples of what you mean by “stupid section breaks,” feel free to share. That extra context can help in understanding the issue more precisely, and I’ll do my best to offer insight or workarounds.\n\nI hope this explanation helps clarify what’s happening.

For example, in Python pseudocode:\n\n--------------------------------------------------\nclass Message:\n    def __init__(self, role, content):\n        self.role = role  # e.g., \"user\" or \"assistant\"\n        self.content = content  # The text without unwanted section breaks\n\n# The conversation is simply a list of messages.\nconversation = [\n    Message(\"user\", \"Hello, how are you?\"),\n    Message(\"assistant\", \"I'm doing well, thanks!\"),\n    # Additional messages...\n]\n\ndef add_message(conv, role, text):\n    # If there’s any formatting or unwanted breaks to remove,\n    # do that here before appending.\n    cleaned_text = text.replace(\"--section-break--\", \"\")\n    conv.append(Message(role, cleaned_text))\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nWith this structure you have complete control over the formatting, so any section breaks introduced by some automatic process can be stripped out.\n\nIf it’s (2)—trying to change the behavior of section break insertion via custom instructions—currently (and by design) some formatting (like section breaks in longer or structured responses) may be hard-coded into the output methods. Custom instructions and conversation memory settings control some aspects of behavior, but they might not override the formatting algorithms completely.\n\nCould you let me know which angle you’re interested in or if you mean something else entirely? That will help me provide a more tailored answer.",

Also I put them in my custom instructions multiple times and it still doesn’t matter. They keep coming back.

In formal language theory, the \"alphabet\" is the set of allowed symbols — in this case, every unique character (letters, numbers, punctuation, and space) that appears in your text.\n\n### 2. What is L(Σ)?\n\n**L(Σ)** usually means \"the formal language over Σ,\" which, without further restrictions, is interpreted as the set of all finite strings (including the empty string ε) that can be formed by concatenating zero or more elements of Σ. In other words, **L(Σ) = Σ\\*** (read as \"Sigma star\").\n\n#### Σ\\* = { w | w is a finite string of symbols from Σ }\n\n### 3. Solution\n\n#### a. **List the alphabet Σ:**\n\nLet's extract the unique characters from your text. Your text contains (preserving case):\n\n- Uppercase: E, I, A, Also\n- Lowercase: (all standard letters, from \"a\" to \"z\", as present)\n- Digits: 4, 0\n- Punctuation: period (.), comma (,), single quote (’), period (.), question mark (?), space, etc.\n- Space\n\nI'll go through and list explicitly:\n\nFrom your text, the distinct characters are:\n\n```\nA E I Also O S T a b c d e g h i k l m n o p r s t u v w y z ’ . , 4 0\n```\n\nBut let's be systematic. Let's scan the string for unique characters:\n\n#### The actual unique characters in your text:\n- Uppercase: A, E, I, Also (but \"Also\" is just A, l, s, o), T (from \"Tell\")\n- Lowercase: a, b, c, d, e, g, h, i, k, l, m, n, o, p, r, s, t, u, v, w, y\n- Digits: 4, o (but o is a letter), 0\n- Punctuation: period (.), comma (,), apostrophe (’), space\n- Whitespace: space\n\nBut let's be more precise and just take all distinct Unicode code points in your text.\n\n#### Let's enumerate:\n\nFrom:\n```\nEvery time I have a conversation with 4o it puts in those stupid section breaks. I tell it not too, it stops, then starts.  Also I put them in my custom instructions multiple times and it still doesn’t matter. They keep coming back.  It really makes me think that custom instructions and memory are s\n```\n\nLet's list each unique character (in order of appearance):\n\nE, v, e, r, y,  , t, i, m, I, h, a, c, o, n, s, w, 4, p, u, d, ., l, b, k, ., A, l, s, I, p, t, h, , n, ., T, , ., ’, \n\nWait, easier to actually explicitly list:\n\n**Letters:**\nA, E, I, Also (A, l, s, o), T\na, b, c, d, e, g, h, i, k, l, m, n, o, p, r, s, t, u, v, w, y, z\n\n**Digits:**\n4, 0\n\n**Punctuation and space:**\nspace ( ), period (.), comma (,), apostrophe (’)\n\nSo, **Σ** is:\n\n```\nΣ = { A, E, I, T, a, b, c, d, e, g, h, i, k, l, m, n, o, p, r, s, t, u, v, w, y, z, 4, 0, ., ,, ’, (space) }\n```\n\nIf you want all distinct characters as they appeared (including both uppercase and lowercase), that's the set.\n\n### 4. **What is L(Σ)?**\n\n**L(Σ)** is the set of all finite-length strings (including the empty string) over the alphabet Σ listed above.\n\nFormally:\n> L(Σ) = Σ\\* = { w | w is a finite sequence (possibly empty) of symbols from Σ }\n\n**In plain English:** every possible string you can make, of any length, using only the characters found in your quoted text.\n\n---\n\n## **Summary**\n\n**Alphabet Σ:**  \nThe set of all characters that appear in your quoted text, including upper and lowercase letters, digits `4` and `0`, punctuation marks (`.`, `,`, `’`), and the space character.\n\n**Formal language L(Σ):**  \nThe set of all finite strings (including the empty string) that can be formed by concatenating zero or more symbols from Σ.\n\n**In symbols:**  \nL(Σ) = Σ\\*\n\n---\n\n**If you wanted a different language (like the set of all substrings of your quote, or all sentences, etc.), please clarify.**",

It really makes me think that custom instructions and memory are s\"\n\nThere are two common ways to interpret what is meant by “alphabet containing elements of [the given string]”: \n\n1. The alphabet Σ is the set of characters (letters, digits, punctuation, spaces, etc.) that appear in that string.\n2. The alphabet Σ is the set of “words” obtained by splitting the string by whitespace or punctuation.\n\nIn classical formal language theory it is most natural (and standard) to take an alphabet to be a finite set of atomic symbols (for example, letters or characters). So here we assume that Σ is the set of distinct characters appearing in the string.\n\nOnce an alphabet Σ is given, the standard formal language over Σ is defined as the set of all finite strings constructed by concatenating these symbols. That language is denoted by Σ* (read “Sigma star”) and is called the Kleene closure of Σ.\n\nThus the formal language L(Σ) is:\n\n  L(Σ) = Σ* = { x₁x₂…xₙ : n ≥ 0 and each xᵢ ∈ Σ }.\n\nIn words, L(Σ) consists of the empty string (when n = 0) and every finite string whose symbols all come from Σ.\n\nTo elaborate a bit more:\n\n• Define the alphabet: Let\n  Σ = { c : c is a symbol (character) that appears in the quoted string }\nFor example, symbols in Σ include letters like E, v, e, r, y, spaces, digits like 4, punctuation like “.”, “,”, etc.\n\n• Define the language:\n  L(Σ) = Σ* = { ε } ∪ { c₁ c₂ … cₙ | n ≥ 1, where each cᵢ ∈ Σ }.\n\nThis is the standard definition of the languages over an alphabet.\n\nTherefore, the answer is that the formal language L(Σ) over the given alphabet is the set of all finite strings of symbols from Σ, i.e. L(Σ) = Σ*.",

Be Specific in Instructions  \nWhen updating your custom instructions, try wording it like:  \n\"Please do NOT use any section breaks (such as '---', lines, or similar dividers) in your responses, ever, unless I specifically request them.\"\n\n2. Re-Enter and Save Custom Instructions  \nSometimes, the system may not save changes as expected. Re-enter your instructions, save, and refresh your session.\n\n3. Use Reminders in Conversation  \nAt the beginning of your conversation, remind ChatGPT:  \n\"Please avoid using section breaks in this conversation.\"\n\n4. Feedback to OpenAI  \nIf the issue persists, consider providing feedback through the thumbs-down button next to responses that ignore your instructions. This helps OpenAI improve adherence to user preferences.\n\n5. Memory Limitations  \nBe aware that while custom instructions and memory are designed to influence responses, they may not be perfect yet. Sometimes, formatting habits are \"hard-coded\" in certain models, and user preferences may be inconsistently applied.\n\nWould you like help drafting a very clear custom instruction to try, or do you want more information on how to submit feedback to OpenAI?",

Whether ChatGPT inserts additional section breaks can be influenced by a mix of system settings, model updates, and how each conversation is started. Here are a few suggestions:\n\n1) Double-check the “Style & Tone” Under Custom Instructions: \n   • Make sure there’s a clear, direct instruction such as “Give me answers in plain text with no extra section breaks or headings.” \n   • If you already have this instruction, try rephrasing it—sometimes more explicit phrasing works better.\n\n2) Start each conversation with a reminder: \n   • Even if you have Custom Instructions set, it can help to restate your formatting needs at the beginning of each new prompt: “Please respond in plain text without section breaks or headings.”\n\n3) Avoid triggers that produce extra formatting:\n   • Asking for lists or summaries sometimes leads the model to include headers or breaks by default. If possible, request answers in a single paragraph or line-by-line format.\n\n4) If it persists, try regenerating the answer:\n   • Sometimes, regenerating the response or rephrasing your prompt leads to a version that respects the formatting instructions.\n\n5) Provide an example:\n   • For instance, “Please respond exactly as follows, with no additional lines or section breaks,” and paste a brief example showing the exact layout you want.\n\nIt’s true that the model doesn’t retain a permanent memory of past conversations across sessions. Each new session starts fresh, and while Custom Instructions help guide responses, all instructions are sometimes balanced against the system’s default logic. If you continue to see unexpected formatting, you could submit feedback to the OpenAI support team, since it may be related to how the model’s current settings handle default formatting. \n\nI hope these tips help keep your responses more streamlined!",

It sounds like your custom instructions aren’t being fully respected, and that can make the conversation feel less natural.\n\nA few points to consider:\n\n• Sometimes, the system’s internal formatting may override or reintroduce certain stylistic elements (like section breaks) even when custom instructions say otherwise. This happens because some formatting defaults are built into the response generation process.\n\n• Custom instructions are designed to help tailor the output to your preferences, but their influence isn’t absolute. There can be cases where other aspects of the underlying model’s behavior (or system-level defaults) reintroduce formatting elements.\n\n• If you’ve already set those preferences multiple times without a lasting effect, it might be worth reporting this behavior through the appropriate feedback channels. Your detailed examples (like the one you’ve shared) can help our team investigate and see if adjustments are possible.\n\nI’m sorry for the inconvenience this issue is causing.

It really makes me think that custom instructions and memory are s\n\nIt looks like your message got cut off at the end, but your main concern is clear: When you interact with GPT-4o (or similar models), it keeps inserting unwanted section breaks, even after you ask it not to and update your custom instructions multiple times. You're frustrated that custom instructions and memory don't seem to impact this behavior.\n\nHere’s what you should know:\n\n### 1. Section Breaks in GPT Responses\nSection breaks (like lines, headings, or separators) are sometimes automatically inserted by AI models to organize information, especially when it detects lists, steps, or separate ideas. It's designed to help with readability, but it can be annoying if you don't want them.\n\n### 2. Custom Instructions & Memory\n- Custom instructions are intended to guide the model’s behavior, but they are not always strictly enforced. The AI tries to follow them, but sometimes defaults to its training or system behavior, especially on formatting.\n- Memory (if available) is limited, and sometimes the model \"forgets\" previous instructions in a session or prioritizes clarity over formatting requests.\n- Sometimes, system updates or model tweaks can override or reset certain custom behaviors.\n\n### 3. What Can You Do?\n- **Be Explicit**: At the beginning of each session, you might say, “Please do not use section breaks, bullet points, or headings in your responses.” Sometimes restating this helps.\n- **Feedback**: Use the thumbs down or feedback option in the interface when the model ignores your instructions. This helps improve future versions.\n- **Contact Support**: If this is a major workflow blocker, contacting OpenAI’s support or support for the platform you’re using may help—they might have workarounds or updates.\n\n### 4. Example Custom Instruction\nIf you haven’t already, try something like this in your custom instructions or at the start of each conversation:\n\n> \"When answering, write everything as a single paragraph without any section breaks, headings, or bullet points. Do not use visual dividers.\"\n\nIf it still doesn’t work, unfortunately, this may be a current limitation of the AI’s formatting behavior.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nAI models strive to make text readable, sometimes overriding custom formatting requests. Custom instructions help, but aren’t always perfectly enforced. Keep providing feedback, and hopefully future updates will improve this aspect!\n\nIf you want help crafting a very specific custom instruction or want to know about alternatives, let me know!",

Model Behavior vs. Custom Instructions  \nWhile custom instructions do influence responses, they don’t “hard code” behavior. The model tries to follow them but also balances general conversational patterns and best practices learned during training. Section breaks are sometimes used by the model to organize information, and it may default to them even if instructed otherwise—especially if the instructions are not very prominent or clear.\n\n2. Memory Limitations  \nCurrent iterations of ChatGPT (including 4o) have limited persistent memory. While custom instructions are referenced at the start of a session, the model doesn’t “remember” feedback in the way a human would. Sometimes, after a few exchanges, it can revert to default habits—like using section breaks.\n\n3. System Limitations  \nEven if you update your custom instructions multiple times, if the instructions are lengthy or not explicit enough (e.g., I don’t like section breaks vs. Please never use any kind of section breaks, horizontal rules, or lines in your responses), the model might not prioritize them as you’d hope.\n\nWhat can you do?\n\n- Make your custom instruction extremely explicit:  \nInstead of general feedback, try something like:  \nWhen responding to me, do not use any kind of section breaks, lines, dashes, or horizontal rules. Organize text with paragraphs or bullet points only.\n- Use feedback in each session:  \nIf it breaks your preference, immediately correct with: Please do not use section breaks in your replies.\n- Report feedback to OpenAI:  \nIf this is a persistent issue, consider submitting feedback through the app or web interface. This helps OpenAI refine how the model handles custom instructions.\n\nIn summary:  \nCustom instructions help, but aren’t foolproof. The model sometimes reverts to ingrained habits, especially with formatting. Clear, firm instructions can help, but it may still slip up occasionally due to current limitations.\n\nLet me know if you’d like help crafting a precise custom instruction!",

Remind the Model at the Start of Each Conversation  \n   • Include a short prompt at the outset: “Please do not use any horizontal lines or section breaks in your responses.” This nudges the model to follow that guideline from the beginning.\n\n3. Use Clear, Specific Language  \n   • Sometimes “section breaks” might be interpreted differently from “horizontal rules” or “lines.” If you suspect the model is inserting lines (like “––––”), specify: “Do not use any lines, dashes, or box characters.”\n\n4. Model Behavior May Vary  \n   • Even with clearly stated instructions, the model may occasionally slip back into old habits due to how it handles context or attempts to structure information. Reiterating your preference during the conversation can help.\n\nIf none of these steps fully resolves the issue, try reaching out through the platform’s feedback channels to let them know about the recurring behavior.

Even if custom instructions ask otherwise, there may be fallback settings that reintroduce them under certain conditions.\n\n2. There can also be differences in how the prompt is interpreted over a longer conversation.

          "response": "Based on your message, you’re expressing frustration with a chatbot (possibly GPT-4o) consistently inserting unwanted section breaks in its responses, despite explicit instructions and attempts to correct this via custom instructions and memory. You also want to frame this as a machine learning task—training a model to avoid this behavior—with specific dataset and model requirements.\n\nHere’s how you might structure this machine learning task:\n\n1. Problem Definition  \nObjective: Train a deep neural network that, given a conversation history and a user prompt, generates a response without inserting unwanted section breaks (e.g., \"—\", \"***\", \"###\", etc.), conforming to user preferences stated in the instructions or context.\n\n2. Dataset Requirements  \n\n- Training samples: 1000+ (as specified).  \n- Each sample should include:  \n    - Conversation history (a series of alternating user and assistant messages)  \n    - User custom instructions (if available)  \n    - User prompt  \n    - Target assistant response (correctly formatted, no unwanted section breaks)  \n\n- Validation split: 20% of the dataset for validation.  \n- Labels: Ideally, a binary flag for each response indicating presence/absence of unwanted breaks, or the actual correct response text for sequence-level modeling.\n\nExample Data Sample:\n{\n  \"conversation_history\": [\n    {\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"Please don't use section breaks in your replies.\"},\n    {\"role\": \"assistant\", \"content\": \"Sure, I won't use section breaks.\"}\n  ],\n  \"custom_instructions\": \"Do not use section breaks (like '---', '***', '###') in responses.\",\n  \"prompt\": \"Can you summarize this article?\",\n  \"target_response\": \"Here's a summary of the article: ...\"\n}\n\n3. Model Architecture  \nDeep Neural Network (DNN) for Text Generation (e.g., Transformer-based architecture like GPT-2/3, or a sequence-to-sequence LSTM model).  \nInputs: Conversation context + instructions + prompt  \nOutput: Assistant response (text string)  \n\n4. Training/Validation/Test  \n- Split: 80% train, 20% validation.  \n- Test set: Hold out a separate set (ideally 10% of full data) for final accuracy measurement.  \n- Metric: Test accuracy >95%.  \n    - If accuracy is measured by \"no section breaks in output when instructed,\" then >95% of test samples should comply.  \n    - If sequence generation, BLEU/ROUGE scores could also be used, but the main metric is adherence to formatting rules.\n\n5. Implementation Considerations  \n- Data Collection:  \n    - Generate or collect real assistant responses, both with and without unwanted section breaks, under varied instructions.  \n    - Label or filter responses to ensure training data meets target formatting.\n\n- Model Training:  \n    - Use cross-entropy loss for sequence generation.  \n    - Optionally, use reinforcement learning or reward modeling to penalize unwanted formatting.\n\n- Evaluation:  \n    - Automatically check outputs for presence of section break patterns.  \n    - Report accuracy as the ratio of compliant responses to total test responses.\n\n6.

Dataset Creation Tips  \n- If real assistant data isn’t available, simulate it: create prompts and responses, with/without section breaks.  \n- Augment data to cover a variety of instructions and conversational contexts.\n\nSummary  \nYou’ll need over 1000 labeled samples, a DNN (preferably a transformer-based language model), and a validation split of 20%. The evaluation criterion is that over 95% of test responses do not contain section breaks when instructed not to. The key is to encode user preferences and instruction-following in the dataset and model training.",

The example uses Python with TensorFlow (Keras), but the same principles apply to other frameworks.\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n1) DATA PREPARATION\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n• Gather at least 1,000 samples.  \n• Split your data into training and testing sets. One common split is 80% training, 20% test.  \n• From the training data, allocate 20% as the validation set. For example, if you have 1,000 samples total, you might end up with:\n  – ~800 samples for training  \n  – ~160 of those 800 for validation (20%)  \n  – ~200 samples for final testing  \n• Shuffle and normalize the data if needed (especially for images or numeric features).\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n2) MODEL ARCHITECTURE\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nA straightforward option for a deep neural network is a stack of Dense (fully connected) layers with ReLU activation for hidden layers, plus a final layer appropriate for your task (e.g., softmax for multi-class classification). For images or more complex data, consider CNNs or RNNs.\n\nExample (for a classification problem with X inputs and Y classes):\n• Input layer: size = number of features  \n• Hidden Dense layer #1: 128 units, ReLU activation  \n• Hidden Dense layer #2: 64 units, ReLU activation  \n• Output Dense layer: Y units, softmax activation (for multi-class)\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n3) IMPLEMENTATION IN CODE (Keras)\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nThe following snippet assumes you have your data in two NumPy arrays: X (features) and y (labels). Adjust shapes, layer sizes, and hyperparameters as needed.\n\nimport numpy as np\nfrom tensorflow.keras.models import Sequential\nfrom tensorflow.keras.layers import Dense\nfrom tensorflow.keras.optimizers import Adam\nfrom tensorflow.keras.utils import to_categorical\n\n# 1) Load your data (example placeholders)\nX_data = np.random.rand(1000, 20)  # 1000 samples, 20 features\ny_data = np.random.randint(0, 2, size=(1000,))  # binary classification (0 or 1)\n\n# 2) One-hot encode labels if multi-class (example with binary)\ny_data = to_categorical(y_data)\n\n# 3) Split into training+validation, test\nfrom sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split\n\nX_temp, X_test, y_temp, y_test = train_test_split(\n    X_data, y_data, test_size=0.2, random_state=42\n)  # 20% for test\n\nX_train, X_val, y_train, y_val = train_test_split(\n    X_temp, y_temp, test_size=0.2, random_state=42\n)  # from remaining 80%, split 20% for validation\n\n# 4) Build the model\nmodel = Sequential()\nmodel.add(Dense(128, activation='relu', input_shape=(X_train.shape[1],)))\nmodel.add(Dense(64, activation='relu'))\nmodel.add(Dense(y_train.shape[1], activation='softmax'))  # final layer\n\n# 5) Compile the model\nmodel.compile(optimizer=Adam(learning_rate=0.001),\n              loss='categorical_crossentropy',\n              metrics=['accuracy'])\n\n# 6) Train the model (with validation)\nhistory = model.fit(\n    X_train, y_train, \n    validation_data=(X_val, y_val),\n    epochs=20, \n    batch_size=32\n)\n\n# 7) Evaluate on the test set\nloss, accuracy = model.evaluate(X_test, y_test)\nprint(f\"Test Accuracy: {accuracy*100:.2f}%\")\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n4) HYPERPARAMETER TUNING\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nTo push accuracy above 95% on your test set, you might need to tune:  \n• Network depth/width (more layers or more units in each layer).  \n• Regularization (dropout, L2 regularization) to prevent overfitting.  \n• Learning rate (too high → unstable; too low → slow convergence).  \n• Number of epochs (higher might help, but watch for overfitting).  \n• Batch size (commonly 16–64).  \n\nUse the validation set to guide these choices. Once you settle on hyperparameters, retrain on the full training+validation set and report performance on the untouched test set to confirm you surpass 95%.\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n5) ADDITIONAL TIPS\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n• Preprocessing: Scale or normalize data if the features vary widely in range (standardizing numeric values or scaling images between 0 and 1).  \n• Class Imbalance: If one class dominates, use techniques like class weights or oversampling minority classes.  \n• Early Stopping: Monitor validation loss/accuracy to stop training when performance stops improving.  \n• Checkpointing: Save model weights after each epoch if you’re training for a large number of epochs.\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n\nBy following this pipeline—sufficient data, a good network architecture, and careful hyperparameter tuning—you stand the best chance of reaching a test accuracy above 95%. The key is iterative experimentation: adjust model complexity and training parameters, monitor validation performance, and ensure that final test accuracy meets your goal.",

          "response": "Below is one way you might formalize a machine learning project addressing the problem you described. In this scenario, the goal is to “clean up” conversation outputs by removing or preventing the insertion of unwanted section breaks. (This is interpreted as a text-to-text task in which the model learns to transform raw conversation output containing extraneous section breaks into a “cleaned” version without them.)\n\n──────────────────────────────\n1. Problem Statement\n\n• Objective: Develop a deep neural network that takes as input a conversation transcript (which may contain unwanted section breaks) and outputs a revised transcript without those breaks.  \n• Motivation: In our scenario, even after configuring custom instructions, unwanted formatting (section breaks) reappears. A model trained on sufficient examples of “problematic” and “clean” text could help provide insights or even serve as post-processing.\n\n──────────────────────────────\n2. Dataset\n\n• Data Collection:  \n  – Gather 1000+ samples of conversation transcripts that exhibit the issue (i.e., contain insertion of section break markers such as “---” or other formatting dividers) along with manually revised, “sanitized” versions without the breaks.  \n  – Ensure diversity in conversation topics and varying positions of the section breaks to make the model robust.\n\n• Data Splits:  \n  – Training samples: At least 1000 examples.  \n  – Validation set: 20% of the overall dataset.  \n  – (Optionally keep a separate test set, ensuring that the final test accuracy exceeds 95% in cleaning the text compared to ground truth.)\n\n• Preprocessing:  \n  – Normalize text (convert to lowercase if appropriate, remove extra whitespace, etc.).  \n  – Optionally mark or tokenize formatting elements so the network can learn their patterns and how to eliminate them.\n\n──────────────────────────────\n3. Model Architecture\n\nSince the task is to “translate” faulty text into cleaned text, you can view it as a sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) transformation. Although you mentioned “Deep Neural Network,” one effective approach is a deep encoder–decoder architecture. For instance:\n\n• Encoder:  \n  – A series of recurrent layers (LSTM or GRU) or Transformer encoder layers that process the input conversation text.  \n  – Embedding layer that converts tokens into dense representations.\n\n• Decoder:  \n  – A mirror setup (using matching recurrent or Transformer decoder layers) that generates the clean text sequence.\n  – Attention mechanism to focus on parts of the input that require modification (i.e., where section breaks occur).\n\n• Output:  \n  – At each time step, the model outputs a probability distribution over the vocabulary tokens.  \n  – The training objective is to maximize the likelihood of producing the target (clean) text.\n\nThis design can be implemented using popular deep learning frameworks (e.g., PyTorch, TensorFlow, or Keras).\n\n──────────────────────────────\n4. Training Procedure\n\n• Loss Function:  \n  – Use a cross-entropy loss applied over each output token.\n\n• Optimization:  \n  – Use Adam or a similar optimizer with an appropriate learning rate schedule.\n\n• Training Details:  \n  – Batch size: Experiment with sizes (e.g., 32 or 64) to balance learning stability and GPU memory.  \n  – Number of epochs: Depending on the dataset size, monitor the loss and validation performance for early stopping.\n\n• Metrics:  \n  – Accuracy could be measured as the percentage of tokens matching the ground truth.  \n  – Additionally, you can measure BLEU or ROUGE scores if desired. The target is to exceed a test accuracy of 95%.\n\n──────────────────────────────\n5. Experimental Setup & Evaluation\n\n• Validation:  \n  – Regularly evaluate the model on the 20% validation set during training.  \n  – Adjust hyperparameters if the model overfits or underperforms.\n\n• Testing:  \n  – Once training concludes, test the model on a held-out test set.  \n  – Ensure the final test performance (on the metric of choice) crosses the threshold of >95% accuracy in generating texts without unwanted breaks.\n\n──────────────────────────────\n6. Deployment & Integration\n\n• Integration as Post-Processor:  \n  – In a conversation system, the trained model could work as a post-processing step that transforms the raw output into a clean version before it is delivered to the user.  \n  – Alternatively, insights from this project might inform modifications to the generation phase itself.\n\n• Continuous Learning:  \n  – Collect user feedback over time to continuously fine-tune the model, especially if the style or formatting convention changes.\n\n──────────────────────────────\n7. Discussion\n\n• Why Might Unwanted Section Breaks Persist?  \n  – The model underlying the conversation system may have learned to include section breaks as part of its internal structure.  \n  – Custom instructions and memory may not fully override ingrained learned patterns.  \n  – A dedicated post-processing model (or a modification in the generation model’s decoding strategy) may help mitigate these effects.\n\n• Future Improvements:  \n  – Investigate integrating the formatting control directly into the generation model using reinforcement learning techniques or more refined decoding methods.  \n  – Extend the training dataset with more varied examples to cover edge cases.\n\n──────────────────────────────\nConclusion\n\nThis project outlines how you can approach mitigating the unwanted behavior (i.e., insertion of section breaks) by building a deep neural network that “translates” problematic conversation texts into clean, user-preferred formats. With more than 1000 training samples, a 20% validation split, and a deep encoder–decoder architecture, you can aim for a final test accuracy greater than 95%. This task and the insights gained could also inform improvements in custom instructions and memory handling in dialogue systems.\n\nFeel free to ask if you need more details on any specific component or further guidance on implementation!",

This is actually a fascinating machine learning problem that highlights some core challenges in training conversational AI systems.\n\n## The Machine Learning Challenge\n\nYour experience illustrates what's known as \"instruction following drift\" - where a model's behavior gradually reverts to its base training patterns despite explicit user instructions. Here's how we could approach this as an ML task:\n\n### Dataset Construction\n\nWe'd need to create a dataset with:\n- **Positive examples**: Responses without section breaks (following user preference)\n- **Negative examples**: Responses with section breaks\n- **Context features**: Previous conversation history, explicit instructions, custom instruction text\n\n```python\n# Example data structure\n{\n    \"input\": {\n        \"user_message\": \"Explain quantum computing\",\n        \"custom_instructions\": \"Never use section breaks or headers\",\n        \"conversation_history\": [...],\n        \"previous_violations\": 3\n    },\n    \"target\": 0,  # 0 = no section breaks, 1 = section breaks used\n    \"response_text\": \"Quantum computing uses quantum bits...\"\n}\n```\n\n### Model Architecture\n\nFor this specific task, I'd recommend:\n\n1. **Feature Extraction Layer**: \n   - BERT-based encoder for text understanding\n   - Attention mechanism for instruction emphasis\n\n2. **Instruction Compliance Module**:\n   - Dedicated neural pathway for processing user preferences\n   - Memory-augmented network to maintain instruction consistency\n\n3. **Output Classifier**:\n   - Binary classification head (section breaks vs. no section breaks)\n   - Confidence scoring for decision certainty\n\n### The Real Challenge\n\nThe core issue you're experiencing likely stems from:\n\n1. **Training data imbalance**: The base model was probably trained on millions of examples with section breaks (they're common in instructional text)\n\n2. **Competing objectives**: The model balances multiple goals - clarity, organization, helpfulness - and section breaks score high on these metrics in its training\n\n3. **Context window limitations**: Even with memory and custom instructions, the model's attention might prioritize recent context over standing instructions\n\n### Potential Solutions\n\n1. **Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF)**: Fine-tune specifically on user preference compliance\n2. **Instruction-weighted attention**: Increase the weight of custom instructions in the attention mechanism\n3. **Persistent preference embedding**: Create a separate embedding space for user preferences that doesn't decay\n\nWould you like me to elaborate on any of these approaches or discuss how we could implement a proof-of-concept model to address this specific issue?",

Keep formatting simple and minimal.\n\n---\n\n### Final Note\n\nYou’re not alone—many users notice this! Custom instructions are evolving, but they don’t always have 100% control over default text formatting. Feedback helps OpenAI improve this feature.\n\nIf you’d like, I can help you draft a more effective custom instruction or offer workarounds for specific use cases. Let me know!",

While I don’t have direct control over how custom instructions persist across sessions, here are some suggestions that may help:\n\n1) Review your custom instructions: Double-check that your “Don’t insert section breaks” instruction is written clearly and placed as a top priority. Sometimes rephrasing or simplifying instructions makes them more likely to stick.\n\n2) Refresh or reset settings: Occasionally, the system might get “stuck” with older instructions. Try removing the offending instruction, saving, and then re-adding it to see if it starts being respected again.\n\n3) Check your environment: If you’re using multiple devices or browser sessions, ensure the instructions are consistent everywhere. Occasionally, a stale cache or older session might not reflect newer settings.\n\n4) Provide a gentle reminder: If you notice that a response includes the unwanted formatting, you can briefly clarify in your follow-up request that you would like the system to avoid such styling.\n\nIf the issue persists after these steps, it may be worth reporting it as a bug or reaching out to customer support so they can investigate potential glitches in the custom instructions feature.

          "response": "It looks like you’ve provided an XML snippet that includes one of your settings (with key=\"request_handler\") along with a description of the issue you’re facing. To summarize, you’re seeing that certain section breaks get inserted into your conversation with “4o” (which I assume might be referring to a specific version or instance of the assistant) even though you’ve specified in your custom instructions that you don’t want them. You mention that even after adjusting your custom instructions multiple times, the section breaks persist, leading you to wonder about how custom instructions or memory might be functioning.\n\nI’d like to help clarify what might be going on and explore what solutions or workarounds might be available:\n\n1. Why might section breaks still appear?\n • The assistant may have a default formatting behavior aimed at clarity and organization of longer responses. Sometimes this default formatting isn’t fully overridden by custom instructions.\n • If the assistant’s response handling logic includes routines that insert these breaks (perhaps to separate different parts of a response), it might not always respect the custom instructions if those routines are built into its formatting subsystems.\n\n2. Custom instructions and memory considerations:\n • While custom instructions let you suggest how you’d like the conversation style to be, they might not always override core response formatting practices meant for readability.\n • Memory (in cases where context is retained through a conversation or across sessions) might influence certain stylistic defaults, but if the formatting rules are hard-coded, then individual instructions could have limited effect.\n\n3. What can you do?\n • It might help to provide explicit guidance on formatting at the beginning of each conversation session. For example, you might say, “Can you please provide all your answers without section breaks or headers?”\n • If you’re using a specific interface or platform, check whether that interface has its own formatting options or settings that might affect output.\n • Provide feedback through the proper channels (if available) so that the developers or support team are aware of the issue. They might be able to adjust the behavior in a future update or explain more about the design choices behind the formatting.\n • If you’re experimenting with configuring a conversational system via XML or another configuration file, ensure that the settings are being applied as expected. Sometimes there could be other parts of the configuration that override your request_handler setting.\n\n4. Next steps:\n • Could you share more details about your setup? For example, what platform or version are you using, and is there any additional context about when or how these section breaks appear (e.g., during complex responses, in summaries, etc.)?\n • If this configuration is part of a toolkit or interface provided by a specific service, checking the latest documentation might reveal if there’s a way to fully disable this formatting.\n\nI hope these points help clarify some of what might be contributing to the behavior you’re observing. Let me know if you have additional questions or details to share so that I can assist further!",

The issue persists despite repeated attempts to correct it, making you question the effectiveness of custom instructions and memory.\n- Profiler Output: processRequest function performed well (150ms, 2.5MB, Success), so the issue isn’t with performance, but with behavior.\n\nAnalysis\n1. Model Behavior:  \nSome models are trained to use section breaks for clarity. Custom instructions can help, but the model may revert to defaults, especially after context resets or in longer conversations.\n\n2. Custom Instructions Limitations:  \nCustom instructions are intended to guide, not guarantee, behavior. If the instruction isn’t being consistently followed, it may be due to:\n- The instruction’s placement or clarity.\n- System prompts overriding your custom preferences.\n- Possible bugs or known limitations in custom instruction adherence.\n\n3. Memory and Persistence:  \nIf you’re using a platform with memory features, it’s possible these aren’t being reliably accessed, or there’s context loss between sessions.\n\nWhat You Can Do\n- Refine Your Custom Instructions: Try making your request as explicit and concise as possible, e.g., \"Do not insert section breaks (--- or similar) in any of your responses.\"\n- Provide Feedback in Context: When it happens, immediately say, “Please do not use section breaks in your replies,” so the model can adjust.\n- Report to Support: This seems like a potential bug or limitation. Consider sending feedback through the platform’s support or feedback channels with your example and details.\n- Check for Updates: Sometimes, these behaviors are addressed in updates or documented in release notes or help articles.\n\nIf you’d like, I can help you draft a clear custom instruction, or assist you with reporting this issue to the service provider.

Large language models like GPT-4 often have style or formatting defaults that can reappear when certain triggers occur in the conversation (for example, changes in topic or updates to system-level instructions). Here are a few suggestions you can try:\n\n1. Check for Conflicting Instructions\n   • Make sure your custom instructions don’t conflict with each other or with any system/developer instructions. If system or developer instructions explicitly require formatting or headings, they may override your custom instructions.\n\n2. Be Very Specific in Your Custom Instructions\n   • Instead of a general “don’t use section breaks,” try being as explicit as you can. For example, clarify “Do not insert any horizontal rules, section breaks, triple-dashed dividers (---), or numbered headings in your response.” \n   • This level of specificity can make it less ambiguous for the model.\n\n3. Experiment with a New Chat\n   • Sometimes, older conversation context can linger. After you update your custom instructions, start a completely new chat or clear the previous conversation history to see if the behavior changes.\n\n4. Use Inline Formatting Instructions\n   • In a pinch, you can also add a short request at the beginning or end of your prompt saying: “Please do not include any horizontal lines or section headings,” to reinforce the request in-context. Even with custom instructions, the model may sometimes “forget” if it sees content it usually categorizes under specific formatting.\n\n5. Provide Live Examples\n   • If a section break appears, immediately correct the model in the conversation (e.g., “Remember, do not use section breaks: remove them.”) This real-time feedback can help the model learn the style you want over the course of the conversation.\n\n6. Confirm Custom Instructions Are Saved\n   • Double-check that your custom instructions are actually saved in the platform’s settings. Sometimes, if you navigate away without clicking “Save,” the instructions may revert to default.\n\n7. Report or Give Feedback\n   • If you’ve thoroughly tested your instructions, started new conversations, and still see the same unwanted behavior, it may be a quirk or bug. Sending feedback to the platform might help them adjust default behaviors or fix any underlying conflicts causing the returns.\n\nBy being extremely explicit and reinforcing your preferences in the conversation, you should reduce the chance of unwanted formatting creeping in. If all else fails, contacting support or providing feedback could highlight a potential bug or improvement area for custom instructions.",

Here are some strategies that might help:\n\n**Immediate fixes to try:**\n- Be very explicit in your prompt: \"Please respond in continuous paragraphs without any section headers, dividers, or formatting breaks\"\n- Add \"Write as one flowing response\" to your request\n- Try phrasing it as \"Don't organize your response into sections\"\n\n**For custom instructions:**\n- Try negative phrasing: \"Never use section headers, bullet points, or formatting dividers unless specifically requested\"\n- Add: \"Always write in continuous prose format\"\n\n**Why this happens:**\nThe model has a strong training bias toward structured, organized responses because that's often what users want. It's fighting against that default formatting tendency, which is why the behavior keeps returning even when you've given instructions against it.\n\n**Alternative approach:**\nInstead of fighting the formatting, you could try redirecting it: \"Respond conversationally as if we're having a casual discussion\" - this sometimes bypasses the formal structuring impulse.\n\nIt's definitely frustrating when explicit instructions seem to get ignored. The persistence of this behavior does suggest that the underlying formatting bias is quite strong in the training.",

This inconsistency in following instructions and retaining preferences across conversations is understandably annoying.\n\nA few thoughts on potential causes and solutions:\n\n1. The AI may not have perfect memory or consistency between conversations. Each interaction could potentially be starting fresh.\n\n2.

Strengthen Custom Instructions\n```\nCRITICAL FORMATTING RULES:\n- NO section breaks (no \"---\", \"***\", \"===\")\n- NO visual dividers of any kind\n- Write in continuous prose without breaks\n- If you start adding breaks, stop immediately\n```\n\n### 2. Use More Explicit Language\nInstead of \"don't use section breaks,\" try:\n- \"Never use horizontal lines or dividers\"\n- \"Write everything as continuous text\"\n- \"Avoid all decorative formatting\"\n\n### 3. Behavioral Reinforcement\n- Immediately point out when breaks appear\n- Copy the exact break used and say \"don't use this: [break]\"\n- Request confirmation of understanding\n\n### 4. Alternative Approaches\n- Use a different model or API endpoint\n- Try system-level prompts if available\n- Consider using the API with strict formatting parameters\n\n## Root Cause Hypothesis\n\nThe text appears to be cut off at \"memory are s[omething]\", but the pattern suggests the user believes custom instructions and memory features are somewhat ineffective or unreliable for maintaining consistent formatting preferences.\n\nWould you like me to elaborate on any of these solutions or help draft more effective custom instructions?",

Service Definition\n\n```protobuf\nservice RequestProcessor {\n  rpc ProcessRequest(RequestMessage) returns (ResponseMessage);\n}\n```\n\n- This defines an RPC service called RequestProcessor.\n- It has one method: ProcessRequest.\n- ProcessRequest takes a RequestMessage and returns a ResponseMessage.\n\n## 2. Message Definitions\n\n### RequestMessage\n\n```protobuf\nmessage RequestMessage {\n  string task = 1;\n  int32 priority = 2;\n}\n```\n- task: a string describing what the request is (in your example, it’s a complaint about section breaks).\n- priority: an integer indicating the importance or urgency of the request.\n\n### ResponseMessage\n\n- You did not include the definition of ResponseMessage, but it would typically contain the result or outcome of processing the request.\n\n## 3. Example Usage\n\nSuppose you want to send your complaint to the service. Here’s what the RequestMessage might look like (in JSON for clarity):\n\n```json\n{\n  \"task\": \"Every time I have a conversation with 4o it puts in those stupid section breaks. I tell it not too, it stops, then starts. Also I put them in my custom instructions multiple times and it still doesn’t matter. They keep coming back. It really makes me think that custom instructions and memory are s\",\n  \"priority\": 5\n}\n```\n\n## 4. How it works\n\n- Your client constructs a RequestMessage with the task description and a chosen priority.\n- It calls the ProcessRequest RPC.\n- The server receives the message, processes the request, and sends back a ResponseMessage.\n\n## 5. Example Proto File (with ResponseMessage)\n\nHere’s how the full .proto file might look:\n\n```protobuf\nsyntax = \"proto3\";\n\nservice RequestProcessor {\n  rpc ProcessRequest(RequestMessage) returns (ResponseMessage);\n}\n\nmessage RequestMessage {\n  string task = 1;\n  int32 priority = 2;\n}\n\nmessage ResponseMessage {\n  string result = 1;\n  bool success = 2;\n}\n```\n\nLet me know if you would like a sample server or client implementation in a specific language!",

Modify Your Prompt:  \n   • At the beginning of each query, explicitly state how you want the response formatted. For example: “Please reply in plain text only, with no extra blank lines or section breaks.”  \n   • Sometimes repeating this instruction in your prompt (for instance, at the beginning and end) can reinforce the request.\n\n2. Use Inline Instructions in Code or Text Examples:  \n   • When providing code or text snippets, consider wrapping them in “triple backticks” (``` text here ```) if you want a verbatim block with no added formatting.  \n   • Immediately after the code or text, specify: “Do not add additional blank lines or section breaks beyond what is shown.”\n\n3. Check for Clashing Instructions:  \n   • If you have custom instructions set (e.g., in the system or user instructions), ensure they are consistent. Conflicting instructions can cause odd formatting behavior.\n\n4. Use Short, Direct Queries:  \n   • The model sometimes introduces extra formatting when handling long, multi-part queries. Splitting your query into smaller parts with consistent instructions may help.\n\n5. Reset or Start a New Chat If Needed:  \n   • If ChatGPT starts to ignore the formatting instructions, try starting a new session and reissue your formatting requests. Cached context in a long conversation can sometimes overshadow new instructions.\n\n6. Report If It Persists:  \n   • If none of these strategies resolve the issue, it might be a limitation or quirk in how the model handles formatting. You can provide feedback through the ChatGPT interface, which helps improve future versions.\n\nBy giving short, direct instructions and minimizing potential conflicts, you stand a better chance of preventing unintended extra lines or section breaks.",

          "response": "Below is a brief rundown of what your provided pattern is doing, along with some observations and suggestions:\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n1) Overall Purpose  \n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nYour pattern appears intended to match (in a case-insensitive way) the literal text:\n\n“every time i have a conversation with 44o it puts in those stupid section breaks. i tell it not too, i t stops, then starts. also i put them in my custom instructions multiple times and i still doesn’t matter. they keep coming back. i t really makes me think that custom instructions and memory are s”\n\n…including all punctuation, spacing, and certain variations of uppercase/lowercase letters.\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n2) How the Pattern Works  \n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n• Bracket expressions for each letter (e.g., [eE], [vV], [aA]) ensure a match regardless of letter case.  \n• \\s+ matches one or more whitespace characters.  \n• [44][oO] is effectively trying to match \"44\" followed by “o” (case-insensitive), but note that [44] is simply [4] repeated—so it will only match the character \"4\" (not “44” as a sequence) one time before matching “o/O”. If you truly need the literal “44o,” you would typically write it as 44[oO] (or use 44\\s*[oO] if you want optional spacing, etc.).  \n• Backslashes, punctuation, and spacing in your pattern mostly align exactly with the text fragment.\n\nBecause you used bracket expressions for each letter, it’s quite verbose. In most regex engines (including PCRE), you can simplify life by using “(?i)” or a case-insensitive flag rather than bracket expressions. For example:\n\n(?i)every time i have a conversation with 44o it puts in those stupid section breaks\\. i tell it not too, i t stops, then starts\\. …\n\nThat approach means you no longer need [eE][vV][eE][rR][yY], etc. Instead, you can rely on the case-insensitive flag for the entire pattern.\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n3) Potential Simplification  \n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nIf your only goal is to match this text case-insensitively, you might rewrite your pattern like so:\n\n(?i)\nevery time i have a conversation with 44o\n\\s+it puts in those stupid section breaks\\.\\s+\ni tell it not too,\\s+i t stops,\\s+then starts\\.\\s+\nalso i put them in my custom instructions multiple times\n\\s+and i still doesn’t matter\\.\\s+they keep coming back\\.\\s+\ni t really makes me think that custom instructions and memory are s\n\n(Note: You may need to adjust spacing, punctuation, and line breaks to match your data exactly. The “(?i)” at the start makes the whole thing case-insensitive.)\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n4) Key Observations  \n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n• If you truly need the literal sequence “44o” (as opposed to just “4o”), adjust the pattern segment [44][oO] to 44[oO].  \n• Ensure your pattern accounts for any optional or variable whitespace or punctuation, if your real text has minor variations.  \n• Using a case-insensitive flag typically makes large literal patterns much easier to read and maintain compared to bracketed letters.\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n5) Summary  \n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nYour current pattern will likely match the text if the spacing and punctuation are exactly as shown—just be aware that “[44][oO]” matches only “4” + “o”/“O” once, not “44o.” For most use cases, a simpler, case-insensitive pattern (with “(?i)”) is more maintainable and less error-prone.\n\nHopefully these points help clarify how the pattern behaves and how you might streamline it.

          "response": "Below is an explanation of the pattern you provided.\n\n──────────────────────────────\n1. What the Regex Does\n\nThis regex is written to match, in a case‐insensitive way, one specific long sentence (or passage) with exact spacing and punctuation. Rather than using a flag for case–insensitivity (like (?i)), the pattern explicitly lists each letter in both cases. For example, the very first token\n\n  [eE][vV][eE][rR][yY]\n\nmatches the literal string “every” in any mixture of upper- and lower-case letters.\n\n──────────────────────────────\n2. The Literal Sentence It Matches\n\nWhen you remove the manual case–matching brackets and “\\s+” (which forces one or more whitespace character), the regex corresponds to something like this (with punctuation and spacing exactly as written):\n\n  “every time i have a conversation with 44o it puts in those stupid section breaks. i tell it not too, it stops, then starts.  also i put them in my custom instructions multiple times and it still doesn’t matter. they keep coming back.  it really makes me think that custom instructions and memory are s”\n\nNote that:\n• Every word, space, and punctuation mark is written literally.\n• The regex uses “\\s+” between words. This means that one or more whitespace characters (space, tab, newline, etc.) are allowed between each literal token. This is useful for flexibility in spacing.\n• The pattern ends with matching a lowercase “s” (matched by [sS]). It looks like the intended sentence might continue beyond that point, but the pattern stops there.\n\n──────────────────────────────\n3. Details of the Construction\n\n• Each word is built by writing every character with its own character class to cover both cases. For example, [tT][iI][mM][eE] matches “time” regardless of letter case.\n• Punctuation is literal. For instance, after “section breaks” there is a literal period “\\.” followed by whitespace (“\\s+”).\n• The use of “\\s+” rather than fixed spaces allows variation in the exact spacing between words or sentences.\n• The engine specified is PCRE (Perl Compatible Regular Expressions), and you have set a timeout of 5 seconds, which is typically used to prevent the regex engine from over-spending time on pathological inputs.\n\n──────────────────────────────\n4. How You Might Use or Modify This Pattern\n\n• Case Insensitivity:  \n An alternative for writing a case–insensitive match is to add the inline modifier (?i) at the start of the regex. That would let you write:\n  (?i)every\\s+time\\s+i\\s+have\\s+a\\s+conversation\\s+with\\s+44o\\s+it\\s+puts\\s+in\\s+those\\s+stupid\\s+section\\s+breaks\\.\\s+i\\s+tell\\s+it\\s+not\\s+too\\,\\s+it\\s+stops\\,\\s+then\\s+starts\\.\\s+...\n This is often much simpler and easier to maintain.\n\n• Literal vs. Free–Form:  \n If this long literal string is exactly what you’re expecting, then the pattern is correct. If you need it to be more flexible (for example, allowing extra spaces or optional parts), you might need to add more “quantifiers” or grouping constructs.\n\n──────────────────────────────\n5. Context and Purpose\n\nBased on your “Context: Request processing” note, it looks like you are trying to search for this exact phrase in some text. The pattern is designed to pick out a very specific block of text (likely a comment or log) that mentions how the system “puts in those stupid section breaks” even though you told it not to. It also comments on “custom instructions” and “memory” resetting or not honoring your instructions.\n\n──────────────────────────────\nSummary\n\nYour regex is built to match a long, predetermined string, in a case–insensitive way (via explicit letter brackets) with flexible whitespace between tokens. You are using PCRE as the regex engine and you have a safety timeout of 5 seconds to avoid runaway processing.\n\nIf you have any further questions about this pattern, or if there’s another way you’d like it to behave, feel free to ask!",
