Here’s how it works and what you can do:\n\nWhy You Might Not See Some API Keys\n\n- API keys are only visible to the user who created them; there is no organization-wide list of all keys.\n- If someone else in your organization created an API key, only their account will show that key in https://platform.openai.com/settings/profile/api-keys.\n- Once an API key is created, only the creator can view or revoke it.\n\nWhat Can You Do?\n\n1. Ask Key Owners to Revoke:  \nIf you know who created the key, ask them to log in and revoke it via https://platform.openai.com/settings/profile/api-keys.\n\n2. Remove User from Organization (Hard Stop):  \nIf you remove a user from your OpenAI organization, their API keys stop working.  \nTo do this:\n   - Go to https://platform.openai.com/settings/organization/members\n   - Remove the user(s) who may have created the keys.\n   - This will automatically revoke their API keys as their account is disconnected.\n\n3. Contact OpenAI Support:  \nIf you cannot identify the user, or if the above options are not viable, contact OpenAI support directly.  \n- Go to https://help.openai.com\n- Use the chat or email options to describe your situation (include your organization details, and why you need certain keys revoked).\n\nBest Practices:\n\n- Keep an inventory of who creates API keys.\n- Regularly audit and rotate keys.\n- Remove users promptly from the organization if they should no longer have access.\n\nUnfortunately, there is no admin dashboard to revoke all organization keys at once; OpenAI only allows the user who created a key, or an org admin by removing a user, to revoke their keys.\n\nLet me know if you need help with any of these steps!",

          "response": "Here are a few suggestions you can try if you need to revoke a key that isn’t appearing under your organization’s list of API keys:\n\n1. Check Under Your Personal User Account  \n   • Sometimes “organization-level” keys end up being created under a user’s personal account rather than showing up under the organization’s settings.  \n   • Go to https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys (instead of organization/api-keys) and see if the missing key is listed there.\n\n2. Verify If Another Team Member Owns the Key  \n   • If a coworker or another user in your organization originally generated the key under their own account, only that user can see and revoke it.  \n   • Ask team members who may have access to the account used for generating that key to check their “API Keys” page to see if they can revoke it.\n\n3. Regenerate or Rotate Keys in Your Code/Environment  \n   • If you cannot track down who controls the key, your best option is to rotate all credentials in your code or services using that key.  \n   • Generate a brand-new key, update your applications/services to use the new key, and then invalidate references to the old one. This effectively removes the old key from active use, even if you can’t officially revoke it from the UI.\n\n4. Contact OpenAI Support  \n   • If none of the above helps and you’re certain the key belongs to your org, reach out to OpenAI support (https://help.openai.com/). Provide them with any details you have about the key in question so they can assist in revoking it from their side or pinpointing the correct account.\n\nUsually, one of the first two steps resolves the issue, as keys are either under the original creator’s personal account or a different organization login. If all else fails, rotating to a new key means the old key will stop functioning as soon as you remove its use in your code and infrastructure.",

The keys might have been generated in a different context (for example, they may be tied to a specific account or integration rather than the organization’s defaults).  \n2. They could be legacy or “system” keys created before certain visibility standards were implemented.\n\nBecause these keys aren’t showing up in the standard list, the standard revoke button isn’t available for them.\n\nYour options are:\n\n• Double-check if you’re logged into the correct account/organization and have the proper admin permissions. Sometimes keys created under different roles or accounts might not show up if you don’t have the right privileges.  \n\n• If you’ve confirmed that you’re in the right place and still can’t view them, the best next step is to contact OpenAI support. Provide details about your organization’s structure and the keys in question, and they should be able to assist with either revealing or revoking those keys. You can reach out directly through the OpenAI help center or support channels.\n\nAt this time, manually contacting support is the only reliable way to revoke API keys that don’t show up on the dashboard.",

API keys created under another user account or team member\n- API keys are user-specific, not organization-wide. If another team member created the API key, only they can view or revoke it from their account.\n- The simplest solution:  \n  **Check with your team members or colleagues to see if someone else created the key. If so, ask them to log in and revoke the key.**\n\n### 2. API keys created under a different organization or account\n- If your company has multiple OpenAI accounts or organizations, it's possible this key was created under a separate account or organization.\n- **Double-check which account was originally used to create the key.**\n\n### 3. Lost or inaccessible keys\n- If you're certain the key belongs to your account and you don't see it listed, it could be a bug or technical issue.\n- In this case, the best action is:\n  - **Contact OpenAI support directly:**  \n    [https://help.openai.com](https://help.openai.com)  \n    Detail your issue clearly, providing as much context as possible (dates, account information, API key prefix if known, etc.).\n\n### Recommended immediate steps\n- **Contact OpenAI support** and explain the situation clearly.\n- **Rotate your keys immediately:** Generate new API keys and update your applications to use the new ones.  \n- **If possible, identify and disable the old key from your application side:**  \n  If you manage the application or service using the key, temporarily disable it there to ensure no unauthorized usage.\n\nUnfortunately, if the API keys are not visible in your account's API Keys settings, there isn't currently a self-service way to revoke them yourself—this action typically must be performed from the account that originally created the keys or via OpenAI support.\n\nI strongly recommend contacting OpenAI support directly, as they are the only party who can confirm the status and revoke keys on their backend, if needed.",

Check with your company's IT or DevOps team: If these are company-wide API keys, your IT department or the team responsible for managing API access might have control over these keys. They may be able to revoke or manage them from their end.\n\n3. Rotate the keys: If possible, create new API keys for your applications and gradually phase out the use of the old keys. This isn't exactly revoking, but it's a way to ensure that the old keys eventually become unused.\n\n4. Review your organization settings: Ensure you have the correct permissions within your organization. You might need admin access to view and manage certain API keys.\n\n5. Check for separate organization accounts: Your company might be using multiple OpenAI organization accounts. The keys you're looking for might be under a different organization.\n\n6. Audit API usage: Monitor the usage of these API keys. If they're actively being used, you'll need to coordinate with the teams using them before revoking.\n\n7. Use OpenAI's API: OpenAI provides an API endpoint for listing and deleting API keys programmatically. This might be an option if you have the necessary permissions.\n\nRemember, it's crucial to coordinate with all relevant teams before revoking any API keys to prevent unexpected service disruptions.

If a key was created in your organization, it should appear under the organization’s API keys page.\n   - Personal keys are only visible to their creator, and organization keys are visible to organization admins.\n\n3. **If You Don’t See the Key:**\n   - If a key does not appear in your organization’s API keys list, it means you do not have the rights to revoke it, or it was created under someone’s personal account.\n   - For security, OpenAI does not allow you to see or manage other users’ personal API keys.\n\n4. **What To Do If a Key Is Lost or Unknown:**\n   - If you suspect an unknown or lost key is being used, you should:\n     - **Regenerate any important keys** that you do control.\n     - **Contact your organization’s admin** to check if they can see and revoke the key.\n     - **Contact OpenAI Support** with as much information as possible if you believe there is a security issue.\n\n5. **Keys Not Shown = Cannot Revoke:**\n   - If a key is not listed, you cannot revoke it directly. This is by design for security and privacy.\n\n**Summary:**  \nYou can only revoke API keys that are visible to you in your dashboard. If your company has lost control of a key or can’t see it, work with your org’s admin or contact OpenAI support for further action.\n\nLet me know if you need step-by-step instructions or have more details about your situation!",

Unfortunately, you cannot revoke a key that is not visible in your account (or that you do not have permission to manage).\n\nHere are some steps that may help:\n\n1) Check your user role and permissions:  \n   • Make sure you are an organization admin (in the OpenAI platform, the owner/admin can manage and revoke API keys).  \n   • If you do not have the necessary permissions, an admin or the organization owner will need to do this for you.\n\n2) Contact the person or account that created the key:  \n   • API keys belong to the user who generated them. If a teammate created a key and you cannot see it, they (or an admin on their behalf) must revoke it.  \n   • Ask them to visit https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys (or Profile → View API keys in the UI) to delete or rotate the key.\n\n3) Use organization-level key management (if available):  \n   • In some plans/configurations, an organization-level admin can see or manage all keys for the team. Check under Organization Settings → Members or a similar section.  \n   • If your plan does not support organization-level management (or the UI does not list older keys), you might need to contact OpenAI Support.\n\n4) Contact OpenAI Support if none of the above works:  \n   • If you absolutely cannot locate who created the key or cannot find it in the organization settings, you can open a Support ticket: \n       – Go to https://help.openai.com and search for “Support” or “Contact.”  \n       – Explain that you need assistance revoking an unseen API key.  \n   • Note that they will generally require proof that you own or manage the organization account in question for security purposes.\n\nIn short, each API key is completely under the control of the user who created it or an organization admin with the rights to manage it. If the key is not visible to you, you’ll need help from the key’s creator, an account admin, or OpenAI Support to revoke it.",

API key locations:  \n • If you generate API keys on your personal account (via https://platform.openai.com/settings/profile/api-keys), those keys are tied to your personal account.  \n • The organization API keys page (https://platform.openai.com/settings/organization/api-keys) would show keys that have been created and managed at the organization level. If you don’t see any there, it usually means that your organization isn’t using organization-scoped API keys—instead, individual users are creating keys on their personal accounts.\n\n2. Revoking keys:  \n • You can revoke any API key that you control by visiting your key management page (for instance, the profile API keys page), locating the key you want to revoke, and clicking the revoke option.  \n • Once a key is revoked, any application or script that was using it will no longer be able to access the API.\n\n3. Extra note for companies:  \n • It’s a good practice for companies to centrally manage API keys. If your organization prefers not to have keys scattered across personal accounts, you might consider setting up guidelines so that organization-level API keys are used instead. That way, you can manage them in one place.  \n • Currently, if your organization hasn’t set up organization-level keys, the keys displayed on your personal page are the ones in use. There isn’t an automatic merge between personal keys and organization keys; the system distinguishes them based on how the key was created.\n\nTo summarize:  \n• If you see your API keys on https://platform.openai.com/settings/profile/api-keys but not on the organization page, those keys are personal to your account.  \n• You can revoke any of these keys by selecting the revoke option on that page.  \n• There isn’t an alternative “hidden” way to revoke keys that your organization doesn’t show—if they’re not there, they’re not organization keys, and you’re managing personal keys.\n\nIf you have further questions about API key management or want to shift to using organization-level keys, you might also consider contacting your organization’s administrator or OpenAI support for specific guidance based on your company’s setup.",

Review past communications: Look through any past correspondence with OpenAI that might contain information about these keys or how they were issued.\n\n4. Audit API usage: Monitor the usage of these keys and consider updating your systems to use new, visible keys that you can manage directly.\n\n5. Implement additional security measures: While working on revoking the keys, consider implementing extra security measures like IP whitelisting or more stringent access controls on your end.\n\nRemember, for security reasons, it's crucial to manage and track all API keys carefully.

Where API Keys Live**\n- On the OpenAI platform, API keys are **tied to user accounts** (not to the organization as a whole).\n- You can only revoke API keys that appear under your own user profile at https://platform.openai.com/settings/profile/api-keys.\n- The organization settings page (https://platform.openai.com/settings/organization/api-keys) does **not** currently show or manage API keys, as OpenAI does not offer \"organization-wide\" API keys.\n\n**2. What If You Can’t See the Key?**\n- If you can’t see an API key in your own profile, it means it was created by **another user** in your organization.\n- You **cannot revoke another user’s key** directly; only the creator (owner) of the key can see and revoke it.\n\n**3. Alternative Revocation Methods**\nIf you need to revoke an API key you can’t see, you have a few options:\n- **Ask the key owner**: Contact the user who created the key and ask them to revoke it via their profile page.\n- **Remove the user**: As an organization admin, if you remove that user from your OpenAI organization, all API keys they created will be automatically revoked.\n    - Go to https://platform.openai.com/settings/organization/members, find the user, and remove them if that’s appropriate.\n- **Contact OpenAI Support**: If you have a business/enterprise plan and cannot identify the key owner, you can contact OpenAI support for assistance.\n\n**4.

Have the key owner revoke or rotate it.  \n   • If you believe a teammate (or former teammate) generated the missing key under their personal credentials, ask them to log into their own OpenAI account to revoke it.  \n   • The API keys page is tied to the logged-in user; each key is visible only to its creator, so it may be that a different account on your team still has a key active.\n\n2. Check (and rotate) credentials where they’re stored.  \n   • Make sure there aren’t any shared repositories, scripts, environment variables, or CI/CD pipelines storing old keys. Even if you can’t revoke them directly from the OpenAI dashboard, removing them from code and systems helps reduce risk.  \n   • When in doubt, perform a scheduled rotation of all keys used in your systems so that old or unknown keys become invalid. This is a fail-safe approach if you suspect “lost” keys might be floating around.\n\n3. Remove older accounts or team members.  \n   • If the key belongs to a user who no longer needs access, remove or deactivate their OpenAI user account from your organization. If they cannot log in, you can reach out to OpenAI’s support; they may be able to assist in deactivating accounts or keys tied to inactive members.\n\n4. Contact OpenAI support.  \n   • If you have exhausted the above options, you might open a support ticket with OpenAI. Provide them with as much detail as possible (e.g., the approximate creation date or account owner) so they can investigate.  \n   • While Support might not be able to provide direct access to a key if you’re not the owner, they can often guide you on next steps or administrative options.\n\nUltimately, if you’re unsure where a missing or unlisted key is in use, the most comprehensive approach is to rotate all existing keys and update your applications accordingly. This way, any older keys—whether visible in your own dashboard or not—will cease to function.",

          "response": "There isn’t an officially supported “backdoor” or alternate method for revoking API keys outside of what’s provided in the OpenAI user interface. In general, API key management is designed so that all keys–whether created individually or at an organizational level–are listed in a known place (for instance, via your account’s API keys page or the organization settings) so that you can revoke or rotate them when needed.\n\nIf you’ve encountered API keys that are in use at your company but aren’t visible through https://platform.openai.com/settings/organization/api-keys (or the profile API keys page), here are a few points to consider:\n\n1. Official channels only: The current design of the API key management system means that keys should be managed via the settings pages. There isn’t an alternate supported endpoint or method (such as an undocumented API call) to revoke keys that aren’t visible.\n\n2. Best practices: If an API key is not showing up in management interfaces, it might be a symptom of a configuration or integration oversight. Best practices recommend regularly auditing and rotating API keys. For example, instead of “revoking” an unreachable key, you might generate a new key for production use and update your systems to use the new key while letting the old one expire (or explicitly revoking it once it becomes visible). Additionally, you can limit the scope of a key by applying usage restrictions (if available) such as IP allowlists, which can help mitigate potential misuse if an old key remains active.\n\n3. Contact support: In situations where you suspect keys are “hidden” or there might be a potential security risk because they’re not showing up in the standard API keys management views, the recommended course of action is to get in touch with OpenAI support directly. They can help investigate whether the missing keys are due to a misconfiguration or if there is an issue with the permissions of the account, and advise on the proper revocation or rotation procedure.\n\n4. Organizational policies: Some companies implement custom solutions or have integrations that generate API keys dynamically. In those cases, revocation might be integrated into a custom internal tool rather than handled solely through the OpenAI interface. If that’s the case, you might need to audit that system as a matter of internal security best practices.\n\nTo summarize, as of now there is no alternative, officially supported way to revoke API keys outside the provided API keys management pages. If you’re finding that some keys are not visible and therefore cannot be revoked via the dashboard, it’s best to work with your organization’s technical and security teams, and if necessary, reach out directly to OpenAI support for clarification and assistance.\n\nKeep in mind that this discussion is purely educational and based on current publicly available information.",

Double‑check that you’re looking at the correct organization.\n\n3) Ask an Organization Owner or Admin to remove old users (and their keys).\n   – If the person who created the keys has left your company (and you’re unable to log in as them), an Organization Owner can manage membership in “Organization settings” → “Members & Roles.”  \n   – Removing a user will invalidate their personal API keys automatically. However, you must first confirm that user was indeed the one who created the keys.\n\n4) If all else fails, contact OpenAI support.\n   – If you are certain the keys are active, but can’t find the user who created them, contact OpenAI support. Provide as much detail as possible (e.g., approximate date created, usage logs, organization details) to see if they can help revoke those keys.\n\nBeyond these steps, there isn’t a hidden or alternative revocation endpoint.

Check if the key belongs to a different user or organization\n   • In multi-user or multi-organization setups, API keys are visible only to the person who created them (unless you have an enterprise plan with an administrator panel that shows all sub-users’ keys).  \n   • Ask all potential creators on your team to check their own “View API keys” page within the correct organization to see if the missing key is listed there.\n\n2. Verify you are signed in under the correct account\n   • Especially in workplaces, people sometimes juggle multiple OpenAI accounts or organization contexts (for example, a personal vs. a company account).\n   • Make sure you are logged in to the exact organization and account that originally created the key.\n\n3. Rotate or invalidate credentials where the key is used\n   • If you realize you no longer control the original account (or cannot find which user created the key), consider rotating secrets on the systems in which the key is used. For example, if your application or service references that key in environment variables or configuration files, remove it and replace it with a newly generated key, effectively making the old one useless even if it’s still active in the OpenAI system.\n\n4. Reach out to OpenAI support\n   • If no one in your organization can locate the key and you must ensure it is revoked, open a support ticket with OpenAI.\n   • Provide any information you have on the missing key (date created, last known usage, or partial key value if you have it). They may be able to locate and revoke it on the backend if you cannot access it from the UI.\n\n5. Follow best practices to prevent unknown or “lost” API keys\n   • Keep a clear record of who creates API keys and how they are stored. \n   • Use a central secrets management system so that credentials are not scattered.\n   • Have a key rotation policy to regularly generate new keys and retire old ones.\n\nIf all else fails, OpenAI support is typically your best resource for forcibly invalidating an unknown or lost key. In the meantime, replacing usage of that key in your company’s code and/or redeploying environments with a new key will ensure the old one can no longer be used even if it remains technically active on OpenAI’s side.",

Double-check the dashboards (both the organization and personal API key pages) in case the key might appear under a different account or profile setting. Sometimes keys can be associated with a user rather than the overall organization.\n\n2. If you can’t locate the key, then it’s likely that these keys were created under a legacy process or via an integration that isn’t supported by the current UI.

Explain that you’re seeing active API keys that aren’t visible on your dashboard and that you need assistance revoking them.\n\n3. As an organization admin, you may want to review internal procedures to ensure that all API keys are issued and managed via the current, supported interface so that you can control and revoke them as needed in the future.\n\nUnfortunately, until there is an update to include all API keys or provide an API revoke endpoint, contacting support is the only available path to have keys revoked that aren’t visible on your dashboard.\n\nI hope this helps clarify the situation!

It’s associated with a different (often older) organization or workspace.\n\nBecause each user can only see and revoke the keys they personally created, you won’t be able to revoke a key through the web interface if you are not the one who generated it. Here are some steps you can try:\n\n1. Check for the correct organization or workspace.  \n   • Make sure you are logged into the same organization or workspace that originally created the key.  \n   • If you’re part of multiple organizations, switch to the appropriate one in the top-left corner of the OpenAI Platform to see if the missing key appears.\n\n2. Have the original key owner revoke it.  \n   • If the key was created by someone else in your organization, they must log into their own account and go to:\n       https://platform.openai.com/settings/organization/api-keys\n     to revoke it.  \n   • An organization admin cannot revoke personal keys that other people created. The creator of the key (or a user with the login credentials for that account) is required to perform the revocation.\n\n3. Remove or rotate keys in code repositories.  \n   • Even if you cannot directly revoke the key in the OpenAI Platform, you can remove or rotate it in any environment variables, scripts, or code where it’s being used. This effectively disables its use from your production environment, so at least it’s not actively accessible.  \n   • As a best practice, if you find your code referencing an unknown or older key, remove it entirely or replace it with a valid, well-documented key.\n\n4. Contact OpenAI Support.  \n   • If there’s no way to locate the original creator or to switch to the correct organization, you might need to reach out to OpenAI Support (via the Help button on the OpenAI Platform or through the Help Center). They can verify ownership and assist in revoking an inaccessible key if necessary.\n\nUnfortunately, there’s no separate “backend API call” you can make to revoke a key that isn’t listed under your own account. The steps above—finding the correct organization, identifying the user who created the key, and/or contacting support—are the standard methods to handle missing keys.",

What type of key is it?  \n • Often, keys created via an individual account’s profile (https://platform.openai.com/settings/profile/api-keys) aren’t automatically managed via the organization page. If a team member created a key through their personal account page rather than using the organization-specific interface, that key is tied to that user’s account—not the organization’s overall management. In that case, only the original account owner can see and revoke it.\n\n2. Legacy or misconfigured keys:  \n • It’s possible that some keys were generated before the current organization management features were available, or they might be “legacy” keys. These might not appear where you’d expect and therefore can’t be revoked through the usual admin console.  \n\n3. What to do if you can’t revoke a key:  \n • If you identify a key that should be managed by your organization but isn’t visible, first verify whether it was created via an individual profile.  \n • If you believe the key is associated with your organization (and you have the appropriate permissions) but still can’t see or revoke it, this might indicate a configuration issue or a bug with the management interface.  \n • In that scenario, the best course of action is to reach out directly to OpenAI support. They can look into your account configuration and help revoke or rotate any keys that are causing security or management concerns.\n\n4. Best practices going forward:  \n • Ensure that all team members know to create and manage API keys through the designated organization interface if you want centralized control.  \n • Consider implementing a policy that enforces key rotation and regular audit of API keys so that any non-compliant keys can be identified and revoked before they become a security risk.\n\nIn short, if you have API keys that aren’t visible on your organization’s API key page, check if they’re personal keys or legacy keys. If you can’t revoke them yourself, contact OpenAI support (usually via the help or support link on the platform) for assistance in revoking or managing these keys securely.",

Here are some suggestions and alternative approaches to consider:\n\n1. Contact OpenAI Support: If you can't see or manage certain API keys through the normal interface, the best first step is to contact OpenAI's support team directly. They can assist you with backend issues or provide guidance on managing keys that aren't visible in the standard dashboard.\n\n2. Check Account Permissions: Ensure that you have the necessary permissions within your organization to view and manage API keys. If you're not the organization owner or administrator, you might not have access to all keys.\n\n3. Audit API Usage: Review your API usage logs to identify which keys are active and being used. This can help you pinpoint the keys you need to manage.\n\n4. Rotate Keys: If you can't revoke a specific key, consider rotating all your keys. Create new keys and gradually transition your applications to use these new keys, then disable the old ones.\n\n5. Organization Settings: Check if there are any organization-wide settings that might be affecting your ability to view or manage certain keys.\n\n6. Use OpenAI's API: OpenAI provides API endpoints for managing API keys programmatically. You might be able to list and revoke keys using these endpoints even if they're not visible in the web interface.\n\n7. Check for Legacy Keys: Some older API keys might be managed differently. Check if there are any legacy systems or processes in place for managing these.\n\n8. Review Third-Party Integrations: If your company uses any third-party services that integrate with OpenAI, check if these services are managing API keys separately.\n\n9. Implement Key Management Best Practices: Moving forward, establish clear protocols for API key creation, distribution, and revocation within your organization to prevent similar issues.\n\n10. Consider Using Environment Variables: Instead of hardcoding API keys, use environment variables in your applications. This makes it easier to update keys across your systems.\n\nRemember, the security of API keys is crucial. If you suspect any keys have been compromised and you can't revoke them, it's important to escalate this to OpenAI support and your internal security team immediately.",

Here’s a breakdown of what’s happening and your options:\n\n### Understanding the Issue\n\n- **API Key Visibility:** OpenAI only displays API keys generated by you (your account) in the API Keys section. If an API key was generated by another user in your organization or before the current UI changes, it may not be visible to you.\n- **Revocation Limitations:** If you cannot see or access the key in the dashboard, you cannot revoke it directly.\n\n### What Can You Do?\n\n1. **Check Organization Admin Rights:**  \n   Make sure you are logged in as an organization admin. Only admins can see all organization-level keys and may have broader revocation capabilities.\n\n2. **Ask the Key Owner:**  \n   If you know which user generated the API key, ask them to log in and delete/revoke their key. Only the creator of a personal key can revoke it.\n\n3. **Rotate Main Credentials:**  \n   If the key is associated with a shared service account (or a compromised account), consider resetting the password or disabling the user.\n\n4. **Contact OpenAI Support:**  \n   If an API key is lost, compromised, or not visible for revocation:\n   - Go to [OpenAI Help](https://help.openai.com/) and submit a support request.\n   - Provide the organization ID and any details you have about the key.\n   - Request a forced revocation or audit.\n\n5. **Audit Usage:**  \n   In the OpenAI dashboard, review API usage logs for suspicious activity. This can help you identify which key may be in use and by whom.\n\n### Recommendations\n\n- **Centralize API Key Management:** Use a secrets manager or vault, and restrict who can create API keys.\n- **Regular Audits:** Periodically review users and API keys in the organization.\n- **Incident Response Plan:** If you suspect a key is compromised and can’t be revoked, treat it as a security incident—contact OpenAI support and consider broader credential rotations.\n\n### Summary Table\n\n| Scenario                                | Revocation Option                           |\n|------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|\n| You see the key in your dashboard        | Revoke it directly                          |\n| You don’t see the key, but know owner    | Ask owner to revoke                         |\n| Organization admin, but not visible      | Check all org keys, contact support if needed|\n| Unknown/lost key, possibly compromised   | Contact OpenAI support immediately          |\n\nIf you need to escalate, OpenAI support is your best option for revoking “orphaned” or invisible API keys.\n\n**Let me know if you need a template for contacting OpenAI support, or have additional questions!**",

Note that I’m not affiliated with OpenAI nor have access to any backend details, so take the following as general best practices and suggested next steps rather than definitive advice.\n\nSituation Recap:\n• It sounds like you’ve noticed that some API keys in your environment aren’t visible in the organization-level API keys page (https://platform.openai.com/settings/organization/api-keys) where you would normally expect to manage and revoke keys.\n• This may indicate that these keys were created using different scopes (e.g., personal keys versus organization keys) or perhaps are created via legacy processes, integrations, or programmatically in ways that bypass public management interfaces.\n\nPossible Approaches:\n\n1. Check the Personal API Keys Page:\n  • OpenAI often distinguishes between “personal” API keys and organization-wide keys. Verify whether the keys in question appear under the personal API key page (https://platform.openai.com/settings/profile/api-keys). If so, revoking them from there may be supported.\n  • Confirm whether different roles or account permissions (administrator vs. standard user) affect which keys are visible. Sometimes keys created under a personal account won’t show up in an organization’s admin console.\n\n2. Use the OpenAI API (if available):\n  • Some vendors provide an administrative API endpoint that allows bulk listing, rotation, or revocation of tokens. Check OpenAI’s documentation for any available management endpoints that allow revoking keys programmatically.\n  • Even if no endpoints are documented, see if any “Account Management” APIs are referenced in the developer guides that may not be immediately obvious in the UI.\n\n3. Account/Organization Settings and Role Privileges:\n  • Verify that you have the appropriate privileges. In some cases, keys may be hidden from non-admin users or from secondary layers of the platform. An account with elevated or full organization permissions might be able to view and revoke them.\n  • If your company uses both personal and organization accounts, ensure that you’re looking in the proper account context.\n\n4. Contact OpenAI Support:\n  • If the keys still aren’t showing up in any management interface and you cannot revoke them through the UI or available API endpoints, the safest path is to reach out to OpenAI support. Include details such as:\n   – The nature of your account (personal vs. organizational)\n   – A list (if possible) or the method by which these keys were created\n   – A request to review and help revoke any keys that are not visible via the standard interface\n  • They might provide an internal method for key revocation or insight into whether this is a deliberate design or a potential oversight/security risk.\n\n5. Audit and Key Rotation:\n  • Even if a direct revocation method isn’t immediately available, consider rotating keys by generating new ones and updating integrations or services that rely on them.\n  • Auditing the usage of these keys can help assess if unauthorized or outdated keys are in circulation. Look into your logs for unusual activity and monitor for API access anomalies.\n\nSecurity Considerations:\n• The inability to view or revoke certain keys from a centralized interface could be considered a security risk. Document your findings, the potential impact (e.g., stale or unauthorized API access), and the remediation steps.\n• Ensure that key rotation policies are enforced so that even if a key cannot be easily revoked, its window of usefulness is minimized.\n\nConclusion:\nAt this time, if API keys do not appear in the expected page, the recommended next step is to verify account roles/permissions and try accessing the personal API keys page. Failing that, check for any administrative API endpoints that may allow direct management. In the absence of these options, contact OpenAI support with your detailed scenario. They are best positioned to expedite a resolution or clarify whether the keys in question are managed differently due to legacy or architectural reasons.\n\nRemember to document all steps and keep security teams informed as you work through the remediation process.",

First, it's important to note that the inability to view or manage API keys through the expected interface is a significant security concern. This situation could lead to unauthorized access or continued use of revoked credentials.\n\n2. Alternative methods to revoke an API key:\n\n   a. Contact OpenAI Support: Reach out to OpenAI's support team directly. Explain the situation and request that they revoke the specific API keys on their end. This is likely the most secure and definitive method.\n\n   b. Rate Limiting: If you have access to your API usage dashboard, you could potentially set the rate limit for the key to zero, effectively disabling it without revoking it.\n\n   c. Rotate Keys: If possible, create new API keys and update all legitimate applications to use the new keys. Then, work with OpenAI to disable the old keys.\n\n   d. Access Control: If you're using any intermediate services or proxies to manage API access, you could block the key at that level.\n\n3. Security Recommendations:\n\n   a. Implement a robust key management system to track all API keys, their owners, and expiration dates.\n   \n   b. Regularly audit API key usage and rotate keys on a schedule.\n   \n   c. Use the principle of least privilege: ensure each key has only the permissions it needs.\n   \n   d. Implement monitoring and alerting for unusual API key usage patterns.\n\n4. Follow-up Actions:\n\n   a. Investigate why the keys are not visible in the expected interface. This could indicate a deeper issue with account permissions or a potential security breach.\n   \n   b. Document this issue and include it in your security assessment report.\n   \n   c. Recommend that the company establishes a clear process for API key management, including creation, rotation, and revocation.\n\n5. Long-term Mitigation:\n\n   a. Work with OpenAI to resolve the visibility issue of the API keys.\n   \n   b. Consider implementing a secrets management solution for better control and auditing of API keys and other sensitive credentials.\n\nRemember, the inability to manage API keys properly is a serious security risk.

Key Was Created by Another User  \nIf the API key was created by a different team member, only that user (or an organization admin) can see and revoke it. Organization admins can usually see and manage all keys for the organization. Make sure you have the correct permissions or ask an admin to check.\n\n2. Key Belongs to a Deleted Account  \nIf the account that created the key was deleted, the key might not be visible in the interface. In this case, you need to contact OpenAI support directly for assistance. Provide them with as much detail as possible (organization ID, suspected key, usage logs, etc.).\n\n3. Key is Associated with a Different Organization or Project  \nEnsure you're viewing the correct organization or project within the OpenAI dashboard. Sometimes, API keys are tied to specific projects or organizations. Switch between organizations in the top-left menu to check other contexts.\n\n4. There is a UI Bug or Backend Issue  \nIf you believe this is a bug, collect evidence (screenshots, key IDs if possible) and report it to OpenAI support via https://help.openai.com or the in-dashboard support widget.\n\n**What you can do:**\n\n- Double-check all organizations and team members for the key.\n- Ask all teammates to check their own API keys and revoke any unused ones.\n- If you have access to usage logs, try to correlate API key IDs to users.\n- As an admin, consider rotating other keys and updating secrets if you believe a key is compromised.\n- Contact OpenAI support with the issue, especially if you have a security concern.\n\n**Unfortunately,** there is currently no \"global\" revoke-all-keys button. If a key is truly \"lost\" from the UI, OpenAI support is your best resource.\n\n**Reference:**  \nOpenAI's official documentation: https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/api-keys/managing-keys\n\nLet me know if you need a template for contacting OpenAI support!",

The key is associated with another organization.  \n   – Go to the top-right corner of your OpenAI dashboard, click on your profile icon, and switch to any other organizations you’re associated with. Then navigate to the API Keys section to see if the missing key is listed there.\n\n3. The key might have been deactivated by someone else already.  \n   – If the key no longer appears anywhere in your account or organization, there is a chance it was already revoked.\n\n4. Contact OpenAI support.  \n   – If you still cannot locate the key in any organization or account, the last step is to contact OpenAI support:\n     • Send them as many details as possible: approximate creation date, the user or account that might have created the key, and any associated usage records.  \n     • You can open a support request by clicking “Help” (or “Help & FAQ”) in the corner of the OpenAI platform, or by navigating to https://help.openai.com/.  \n\nOnce you or someone within your organization locates the right account or organization, you can revoke the key by:\n\n1.

If you’re not seeing certain API keys listed on https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys (or via your organization’s API key management page), here are a few steps you might consider:\n\n1. Check if these keys were generated using an older process. Sometimes legacy keys or keys created under different roles might not be displayed in the current management interface.\n\n2. Verify that you’re looking in the correct account or organizational space. If your company uses multiple subaccounts or has a special integration, the keys might be managed differently.\n\n3. Confirm that you have the necessary permissions. If you’re not an administrator, some keys might be hidden from your view even though they exist.\n\n4. As a next step, reach out to OpenAI support. Explain the situation, providing details about the missing keys and your concerns over revoking them. The support team can help investigate whether these keys might be “invisible” due to an account configuration issue or a legacy setup and advise on revocation.\n\nCurrently, there isn’t an alternative public method (such as an API endpoint) that allows revocation of keys that aren’t displayed in your account’s dashboard. The recommended path is to contact OpenAI support for further assistance.\n\nRemember that API keys are sensitive credentials. If you suspect keys have been leaked or misused, it’s a good idea to raise the issue as soon as possible with your organization’s security team and OpenAI support so that any necessary steps can be taken to mitigate risk.\n\nI hope this helps clarify the situation and provides a path forward!",

Organization vs. Personal API Keys\n- Organization Keys: Only organization admins can see and manage these at the org API keys page.\n- Personal Keys: Each user can see/revoke their own keys on their profile settings page.\n\n2. If the Key Isn’t Listed\n- If you do not see the API key on either the organization or personal API keys page, you cannot revoke it directly via the web interface.\n\n3. Possible Reasons the Key Isn’t Visible\n- The key may have been deleted already.\n- You may not have the required admin permissions.\n- The key might belong to a different user in your organization (you can’t view/revoke others’ personal keys).\n\n4. What Can You Do?\n- If it’s an organization key and you’re an admin, make sure you’re on the correct page and logged in with the right account.\n- If it’s a user key, only the user who created it can revoke it.\n- If you suspect the key is still active but can’t see it, **contact OpenAI Support** directly:\n   - Go to https://platform.openai.com/help and submit a request.\n   - Provide details (org name, key prefix if known, etc.).\n   - They can revoke keys at the backend if needed.\n\n5. Security Best Practice\nIf you believe a key is compromised, rotate all keys and update your integrations accordingly.\n\n**Summary:**  \nThere is no alternate self-service way to revoke a hidden API key if it’s not visible on the OpenAI dashboard. You must contact OpenAI Support for further assistance.\n\nLet me know if you need help with the support request template!",

They may be able to help you revoke it on the backend.  \n\n4) Update or rotate any possibly exposed credentials.  \n   • Whenever you suspect you have “lost track” of a key, it’s best practice to generate new keys for important integrations and remove old ones from code, environment variables, or config files.  \n\nIn general, only keys owned by a user in the organization will appear in “View API keys.” If it’s not there, it usually means someone else generated it, or it belongs to a different Organization.

          "response": "Below is a general step-by-step breakdown for troubleshooting or revoking API keys that are not visible in the “API Keys” dashboard of your organization. Because every OpenAI organization or account setup can be slightly different, some steps may not apply exactly to your scenario—but these tips should point you in the right direction.\n\n──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n1. Confirm Who Owns the Missing API Key\n──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n• API keys belong to the user who created them; each user in an organization has their own set of keys. These “personal” keys will only appear in the creator’s “View API keys” dashboard.  \n• Check if a colleague or a former team member generated the key under their personal account. In that case, they must log in and revoke it.  \n\n──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n2. Verify Organization-Level vs. User-Level Keys\n──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n• OpenAI currently provides per-user API keys, meaning that you cannot view or manage someone else’s keys (even if you all belong to the same organization).  \n• Ensure that you are checking the correct place:  \n  – Your personal keys appear at https://platform.openai.com/settings/profile/api-keys.  \n  – Your organization’s settings appear at https://platform.openai.com/settings/organization.  \n• Although you can manage billing and shared usage limits at an organization level, you typically cannot see or revoke a user’s personal API keys from a central admin panel.  \n\n──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n3. If the Key Owner Is Unavailable\n──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n• If the user who originally created the key is no longer available (or if that user’s account no longer exists but the key is still active), you might consider temporarily removing that user from your organization in the “Manage Team” section. If a user is fully removed, any tokens and associated accounts may effectively lose access to the organization and its billing.  \n• As of now, OpenAI doesn’t provide a direct “admin override” feature to revoke user-owned keys, so if the original account still exists and is active but simply not accessible to you, you may need assistance from that user or from OpenAI Support.  \n\n──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n4. Rotate Credentials Where Possible\n──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n• If the missing key has been used in a project or production environment that you control, and you cannot directly revoke the key, consider rotating credentials or generating entirely new keys for your environment. Update your applications to use new keys so that any old, unknown, or unrevoked key becomes effectively useless.  \n\n──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n5. Contact OpenAI Support (If Necessary)\n──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n• If the situation is urgent (e.g., a security concern) and you do not have access to the account that created the API key, reach out to OpenAI Support.  \n• Provide details (the organization ID, the email address of the missing key’s owner if you know it, relevant logs, etc.) so the support team can help you track down or invalidate the key.  \n\n──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n6. Best Practices Going Forward\n──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n• Encourage all team members or developers in your organization to label their API keys clearly. Proper labeling helps keep track of which environments and whose account a key belongs to.  \n• Keep a secure record of keys, their lifespan, and who owns them. Then, if someone leaves the organization, you can more quickly locate and revoke or rotate them.  \n• Consider implementing a policy where all keys are created under shared organizational credentials (where feasible) or systematically stored in a secrets manager. This helps ensure visibility and revocation control.  \n\n──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n\nSummary:\nIf a key is missing from your “API Keys” dashboard, it typically means it belongs to a different user account. That user must revoke it from their own account settings. If you can’t gain access to the responsible user or account, you may need to rotate credentials in your project or escalate the issue to OpenAI Support for assistance.",

Confirm Which API Keys You’re Dealing With\n\n• Determine whether the keys in question were created under your personal account or the organization account.  \n• Check both settings pages:  \n  • Personal API keys: https://platform.openai.com/settings/profile/api-keys  \n  • Organization API keys: https://platform.openai.com/settings/organization/api-keys\n\n─────────────────────────────  \nStep 2. Verify Your Organization and Role\n\n• Ensure that you’re logged in to the proper account and that you’re operating within the correct organization.  \n• If you’re part of a company account, verify your role – only certain roles (like owners or admins) may have the ability to manage (create/revoke) API keys.\n\n─────────────────────────────  \nStep 3. Check for UI Discrepancies\n\n• Sometimes keys might be omitted due to UI bugs or misconfigurations. Try the following:  \n  – Refresh the page or clear your browser cache.  \n  – Try a different browser or incognito mode.  \n  – Confirm that your account permissions have not recently changed.\n  \n─────────────────────────────  \nStep 4. Identify How the Keys Were Generated\n\n• Determine if these keys were issued manually from the dashboard or provisioned by another system (for example, via an integrated tool or API call).  \n• Keys created outside the standard dashboard may not appear in the expected list.\n\n─────────────────────────────  \nStep 5. Look for Alternative Revocation Options\n\n• If a key is visible in your personal API keys page (https://platform.openai.com/settings/profile/api-keys), you can click the “revoke” button next to it.  \n• For organization API keys that do not show up, note that OpenAI does not currently offer an alternative “revoke via API” functionality for keys that aren’t listed.\n  \n─────────────────────────────  \nStep 6. Contact Your Organization’s Administrator\n\n• Reach out to whoever manages the company’s OpenAI account.  \n• It’s possible that some keys were generated using a different method or an admin-level tool that may have separate management controls.\n\n─────────────────────────────  \nStep 7. Contact OpenAI Support\n\n• If you’ve validated that you’re in the correct account and the keys still aren’t visible, the next step is to file a support ticket with OpenAI.  \n  – Provide details: your account information, the keys’ (or key IDs, if available) origin, and your concern that they cannot be revoked via the UI.  \n  – Ask whether there’s a backend method or administrative action that can revoke the keys.\n\n─────────────────────────────  \nStep 8. Consider Future Key Management Practices\n\n• If you have keys generated through automated processes that aren’t visible in the dashboard, consider reviewing your key issuance policies.  \n• Work with the team to ensure that all keys (or key creation tools) are tied to an administrator-managed process so that they can be revoked when needed.\n\n─────────────────────────────  \nSummary\n\nAt this time, if API keys do not appear in the organization’s settings page, there isn’t an alternate “hidden” method provided through the dashboard to revoke them. You’ll need to confirm that you’re checking the correct account and page, review administrative permissions and key generation methods, and then if necessary, escalate the matter to your company’s account administrator or contact OpenAI support for assistance.\n\nThis systematic investigation should help you identify why you are not seeing the keys and what steps you can take to revoke them.",

Vérifier le rôle et les droits :  \n   • Assurez-vous de vous connecter avec le compte qui a généré la clé d’API. En effet, seule la personne (ou le compte) propriétaire de la clé peut la révoquer depuis l’interface.  \n   • Dans le cadre d’une organisation, contactez l’« Administrateur » ou le « Propriétaire » de l’organisation pour vérifier s’ils peuvent voir la clé, et s’ils ont les droits nécessaires pour la supprimer.\n\n2. Utiliser l’interface d’administration de l’organisation :  \n   • Dans votre espace OpenAI, rendez-vous dans “Organization settings” (Paramètres de l’organisation) pour voir l’historique et la liste complète de toutes les clés (si vous êtes l’Owner ou un Admin).  \n   • Si la clé correspond à un autre utilisateur de votre organisation, demandez-lui de la révoquer directement depuis son propre onglet « API keys ».\n\n3. Contacter le support OpenAI :  \n   • Si vous n’avez pas accès à la clé parce que vous ne détenez pas le compte qui l’a créée et que personne dans votre organisation ne peut la révoquer, contactez le support OpenAI (via https://help.openai.com ou en ouvrant un ticket).  \n   • Fournissez-leur les détails nécessaires (ID de l’organisation, email du propriétaire, etc.) afin qu’ils puissent vous aiguiller ou révoquer la clé si besoin.\n\nEn résumé, si vous ne voyez pas une clé d’API sur votre interface, c’est certainement un problème de droits ou d’appartenance de compte. En général, il n’existe pas d’autre méthode que de la révoquer via l’interface (pour celui ou celle qui l’a créée) ou en passant par l’assistance OpenAI si, pour une raison donnée, elle ne peut pas être révoquée normalement.",

Проверьте, используете ли вы правильный аккаунт и нужную организацию (это можно сделать, убедившись в переключателе между организациями в правом верхнем углу панели управления).\n\n2. Попробуйте найти информацию о ключах в разделе индивидуальных настроек (https://platform.openai.com/settings/profile/api-keys), если ключ был создан для личного использования.\n\n3. Если ключ так и не отображается ни там, обратитесь в службу поддержки OpenAI, описав ситуацию. Лучше всего сформулировать запрос, указав, что API-ключи вашей компании недоступны для просмотра и отзыва через стандартный интерфейс, и привести соответствующие ссылки. Поддержка сможет проверить работу вашей учетной записи, права доступа и, если потребуется, отозвать ключи вручную.\n\nНа данный момент это единственный метод получения помощи в подобных случаях, поскольку стандартных альтернатив (например, командной строки или API для отзыва ключей) не предусмотрено для той ситуации, когда ключи не выводятся в управляющем интерфейсе.\n\nНадеюсь, это поможет решить вашу проблему. Если будут дополнительные вопросы, обращайтесь!",

API keys are only visible to the user who created them.\n\nWhat you can do:\n\n1. Ask all users in your organization to review and revoke unused or compromised API keys from their own profile page.\n2. If you have suspicions about a specific key being compromised, rotate (change) your organization’s API keys and update your applications to use the new key(s).\n3. For highly sensitive situations, contact OpenAI Support directly via https://platform.openai.com/help or support@openai.com. Provide them with details (organization ID, possible key prefix, etc.).

Make sure you’re in the correct Organization / Workspace\n   • On the OpenAI platform, you can belong to multiple organizations. If you only look under one org’s settings but the key was created in another, it won’t appear.  \n   • Check the organization switcher in the top-left corner (in the OpenAI Dashboard), and select each organization you belong to. Then go to “View API Keys” for each one and see if the missing key is there.\n\n2. Verify if the key is a personal key or an organization-level key  \n   • Keys created under your personal account (rather than an organization) will be visible under “Personal” instead of “Organization” in the API Keys page. \n   • Make sure you’re checking the right tab or URL (personal keys are shown under https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys while organization owners can see org-level keys at https://platform.openai.com/settings/organization).\n\n3. Check if you have the required permissions  \n   • If you are not the organization owner or admin, you may not have the correct permission to see or revoke certain API keys.  \n   • Double-check with the organization owner or admin. They might be the only ones who can view or revoke some keys.\n\n4. If all else fails, contact OpenAI support  \n   • If you cannot locate the key under any of the organizations you belong to, and you’re certain the key still exists, it may be linked to a separate account or an older workspace that you no longer have access to.  \n   • You can reach out to OpenAI support (via the “Help” or “Support” section in the platform) to revoke an API key that is no longer accessible to your current user or organization.\n\n5. As a fallback, rotate credentials  \n   • From a security perspective, if you believe a key is out in the wild and you cannot officially revoke it, one best practice is to change any systems that rely on it by switching to a new key. This doesn’t strictly “revoke” the old key in the OpenAI Dashboard sense, but it effectively prevents unauthorized usage if your systems stop using it.\n\nUsually, the only official way to remove or invalidate a key is via the OpenAI Dashboard (either in personal API Keys or the Organization’s API Keys section).

Unfortunately, there isn’t an alternate revocation “button” or API call available for keys that don’t appear in your list.\n\nIn these cases the recommended steps are:\n\n1. Contact OpenAI Support: Let them know that you have API keys in use within your organization that aren’t showing up in your dashboard and that you’d like to disable (or rotate) them. They can look into your account details, verify how these keys are being managed and help revoke them if needed.\n\n2. Review Your Organization’s API Key Policy/Setup: It might be that these keys were created as part of a legacy or internal process. Check with whoever set up your company’s integration with the OpenAI API so you can better understand how key provisioning is being handled.\n\n3. Consider a Key Rotation Strategy: Even if you must wait on support to revoke these keys, it may be helpful to plan for rotating API keys by updating your integrations to use keys that you can manage via the standard UI. This increases security and gives you direct control in the future.\n\nAs it stands, until OpenAI provides a direct way to revoke keys in this kind of scenario there isn’t an alternate method you can use yourself.\n\nI hope that helps!

This will effectively revoke the old key. To do this, go to the \"API Keys\" section in your OpenAI dashboard, click \"Create new secret key,\" and then deactivate the old key.\n\n3. **Restrict API Key Usage**: Another option is to restrict the usage of the API key you want to revoke. You can do this by setting strict rate limits, IP restrictions, or other access controls on the key. This will limit the potential damage if the key is being misused.\n\n4. **Audit API Usage**: Review your API usage logs and activity to identify any suspicious or unauthorized usage of the API key you want to revoke.

This is a limitation for some organizations or account configurations.\n\n### Why does this happen?\n- **Service Accounts or External Management:** Sometimes API keys are created via service accounts, integrations, or external identity providers.\n- **Older Keys:** Keys created with older account structures may not be listed.\n- **Organizational Restrictions:** Some organizations restrict API key visibility for security reasons.\n\n---\n\n## Alternative Ways to Revoke or Rotate API Keys\n\n### 1. **Contact OpenAI Support**\n- Go to [OpenAI Help](https://help.openai.com/).\n- Provide your organization ID and details about the keys.\n- Request manual revocation of the keys not shown in your dashboard.\n- This is the most reliable method if keys are not manageable in the UI.\n\n### 2. **Check for External Key Management**\n- If your organization uses an external identity provider or secret management system (like AWS Secrets Manager, GCP Secret Manager, Azure Key Vault, etc.), check if the keys are stored and managed there.\n- You may be able to revoke or rotate them from those systems.\n\n### 3. **Rotate Keys in Code/Infrastructure**\n- If you can’t revoke the key, you can at least stop using it:\n    - Remove the key from your codebase, environment variables, CI/CD systems, etc.\n    - Replace it with a new key that **is** visible and manageable.\n\n### 4. **Audit Usage**\n- In your OpenAI dashboard, check the [Usage](https://platform.openai.com/usage) section.\n- If you see usage from keys you no longer control, alert OpenAI support immediately.\n\n---\n\n## Important:\n- **There is currently no API endpoint to revoke or list API keys programmatically** ([OpenAI docs](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/api-keys)).\n- Always treat API keys as sensitive credentials and rotate them regularly.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nIf you cannot see or manage your API keys in the OpenAI platform UI, contact OpenAI support directly. There is no public API or alternate self-service method to revoke invisible keys.

          "response": "It can certainly be frustrating when you need to revoke an API key but you’re unable to see it in the “View API Keys” section. Here are a few suggestions:\n\n1. Check if you are in the correct account (or organization).  \n   – Make sure you’re logged into the exact account (or organization) under which the API key was created. If you have multiple accounts or if your company has multiple team members who might have created API keys, confirm that you’re using the correct login.\n\n2. Confirm your role.  \n   – If you’re in an organization where there are multiple members, you may need Owner or Admin privileges to see and manage all keys. If you only have Developer access (or another more limited role), you may not see keys created by others.\n\n3. Generate and replace the key instead of revoking.  \n   – If you cannot locate the old key and your primary goal is to ensure it no longer works, an alternative is to generate a new key and update your code/services to use the new one. Although this doesn’t strictly “revoke” the old key if you can’t see it, it will effectively disable it for most architectures—assuming only you or your team had access to the code or environment where the key is used.\n\n4. Contact OpenAI Support if you still can’t find or revoke the key.  \n   – If the above steps don’t help, consider reaching out to OpenAI Support. Through their support channel, you can explain that you no longer see your API key and cannot revoke it yourself. They may be able to help with direct removal on the back end or provide additional instructions tailored to your organization’s setup.\n\n5. Check organization settings.  \n   – Revisit the “Organization settings” area and confirm that the correct organization and its list of keys are visible. Sometimes toggling between “Personal” and “Organization” can hide or reveal different sets of keys.\n\nBy design, keys can only be managed by the user and organization that created them. If your company has a single “owner” account—for example, a shared credentials setup—and that’s the only account with the authority to create or delete API keys, you or a coworker with access to that account would need to use it to do the revocation.\n\nIf you still have trouble even under the owner account and the keys do not appear, involve OpenAI Support. They’ll be the best resource if your keys or account settings are out of sync with what is displayed in the dashboard. Good luck, and hopefully one of these approaches helps you safely rotate or revoke the API keys!",

Here are a few pointers that may help:\n\n1. Account vs. Organization Keys:\n • In many cases, API keys are managed on a per‑user (profile) basis rather than strictly for the organization. The keys that don’t show in the organization settings might instead be visible (and revocable) on your personal API keys page at https://platform.openai.com/settings/profile/api-keys.\n • If you locate the keys on the profile page, you should be able to click the revoke (or “rotate”) option next to each key to disable it.\n\n2. Legacy or Differently Generated Keys:\n • Sometimes keys created in older workflows or under specific circumstances might not be automatically listed in the organization dashboard. If you suspect you’re in this situation, double‑check your profile page first.\n • If you still cannot find the key you’re looking for, it may be a legacy key that requires a different process to disable.\n\n3. Next Steps if You Can’t Revoke via the Dashboard:\n • Contact your organization’s administrator: In many teams, API key management is centralized. It may be that your company’s admin has the appropriate access or knowledge of the key’s origin.\n • Reach out to OpenAI Support: If you believe that there is an issue with how your keys are displayed or managed (or if these keys were created in a way that leaves you with no method for revocation) the best course of action is to contact OpenAI support directly. They can often offer guidance or take direct steps to help you revoke the problematic keys.\n\n4. Security Best Practices:\n • As always, if you suspect that an API key has been exposed or that it may be compromised, it’s best to revoke it promptly and generate a new one.\n • Keep a record of which keys are associated with which applications or services so that future rotations or revocations can be managed efficiently.\n\nAt the moment, there isn’t an alternate “hidden” method to revoke keys beyond what’s provided in the account (profile) and organization dashboards—so if a key isn’t appearing in those places, contacting support is generally the recommended approach.\n\nI hope this helps clarify your options for revoking the API key. Let me know if you have any more questions or need further assistance!",

API keys that were created by other users or under different permissions might not appear directly under your individual profile.\n\n### 2. Contact the Original Key Creator\nIf the keys were created by another user within your organization, only the original creator or an admin with sufficient privileges may be able to revoke them. Check with the original creator or an organization administrator.\n\n### 3. Contact OpenAI Support\nIf you have keys that are not visible and not revocable through your organization's dashboard, you should contact OpenAI's support team directly. They can help resolve this issue or confirm if there's a backend issue:\n\n- OpenAI Support page: [https://help.openai.com](https://help.openai.com)\n- Email: support@openai.com (if applicable)\n\n### 4. Rotate Credentials and Secure Your Account\nAs a security measure, if you are concerned about unauthorized use or cannot revoke problematic API keys, immediately rotate any affected credentials or tokens. You might also want to adjust your API endpoints or remove access to sensitive resources until the issue is resolved.\n\n### Summary of Next Steps\n- Ensure you have admin privileges or ask the admin.\n- Communicate directly with the API key creator.\n- Contact OpenAI support directly if you suspect a technical issue or a bug.\n\nI hope this helps you resolve your issue quickly!",

This automatically revokes all API keys associated with that user.\n- Contact OpenAI support: If neither of the above options is possible (e.g., the user account is compromised), contact OpenAI support directly at [OpenAI Help](https://help.openai.com/) and provide details. They can help revoke keys in emergency situations.\n\n3. Best practices\n- Maintain a list of who has access to which API keys.\n- Have a policy for offboarding users that includes revoking their API keys.\n- Use service accounts or shared accounts for critical integrations, with access managed by admins.\n\n**Summary:**  \nYou cannot revoke API keys that you do not own via the dashboard.

Make sure you are in the correct organization.  \n   • If you have access to multiple organizations under your account, confirm you have selected the correct one in the top-left dropdown of the OpenAI platform.  \n   • API keys are scoped to the organization where they were created, so being in the wrong org view can hide keys.\n\n2. Verify your role and permissions.  \n   • Only the person/account that originally created the API key can directly manage (revoke) that key.  \n   • Organization Owners and Admins can typically see all keys created within the organization, but if these keys were created under individual user accounts (with their own billing), you might not see them unless you switch to that user’s organization.  \n   • Double-check that you (or someone with the correct role) are looking in the correct place under \"API Keys\" for your organization.\n\n3. Ask the key owner to revoke it.  \n   • If the API key belongs to another team member, you must either have that individual revoke the key themselves or use an admin-level login that has the rights to revoke keys at the org level.  \n   • Sometimes keys are created under personal accounts rather than the central, shared org account, so the user who generated them must take action.\n\n4. As a last resort, contact OpenAI support.  \n   • If the key’s original creator is no longer at your company or you have no way to access their account, reach out to OpenAI support (https://help.openai.com/) and provide the relevant information (organization ID, key usage details, etc.). They may be able to assist in revoking or deactivating orphaned keys.\n\n5. Update internal policies to prevent key “loss.”  \n   • Set up an internal process so that API keys are only created and managed centrally by the admin or owner accounts.  \n   • Document keys, assign them clearly to teams or applications, and keep track of who can revoke them.\n\nUnfortunately, there is not currently a standalone method (like a separate API endpoint) to force-revoke a key that does not appear in the organization’s dashboard if you do not have ownership of that key. The safest route is to ensure someone with the correct rights in the correct organization handles it or to involve OpenAI support if you suspect a key is lost or unrevokable via your normal channels.",

That said, there are a couple of points to consider if you can’t see all of your organization’s API keys in the Organization API Keys settings page:\n\n1. Legacy Keys versus New Keys: Some API keys created before recent updates (often termed “legacy” keys) may show up only on the personal account page (at https://platform.openai.com/settings/profile/api-keys) rather than the organization page. If your company’s keys aren’t visible in the organization view, check the profile API keys page.\n\n2. Administrator Access: API keys created in an organization environment might be managed only by organization admins. Make sure that you have the proper permissions to view and revoke keys. Sometimes, keys created under a personal account (even if used by your company) will only appear in your personal API keys settings.\n\n3. Revocation Process: When you do see a key in the dashboard (whether on the organization or personal page), you can click the “Revoke” (or similar) button next to the API key to invalidate it immediately—preventing any further use.\n\n4. Contacting Support: If you’ve double-checked both pages, and still can’t locate or revoke some keys, the best step is to reach out to OpenAI support. Explain the situation and provide the details so they can help secure the keys in question.\n\nIn summary, aside from using the dashboard interfaces provided (either the organization or the profile API keys page), there is currently no separate or ‘hidden’ method (such as a backend API call) to revoke API keys. If keys are not showing where you expect, reviewing your account’s role and checking both the organization and personal pages, as well as contacting support if needed, is the recommended approach.",

Ask all current team members to check their own https://platform.openai.com/settings/profile/api-keys page and revoke any old or unused keys.\n2. If the key was generated by a former employee, you need to deactivate their account in your organization’s user management panel. This will automatically revoke their API keys.\n3. If you do not have access to the account that created the key and cannot identify the owner, contact OpenAI Support. Provide the key ID (if known) and details; they may be able to assist in revoking it at the backend.\n\nSummary:\n- Only the creator or an admin (by deactivating a user) can revoke an API key.\n- There is currently no universal admin panel to see and revoke all keys for all users in an organization.\n- For security, regularly audit users and keys, and remove access for those who no longer need it.\n\nReferences:\n- OpenAI API key management documentation\n- OpenAI help: https://help.openai.com/en/articles/5112595-how-to-view-and-manage-your-api-keys\n\nIf you need further assistance, contacting OpenAI support is the best route!",

If keys are not visible on your own “API Keys” page—or within your company’s organization settings—then you generally will not be able to revoke them directly. Below are a few approaches you can try:\n\n1) Double-check you’re in the correct account/organization.  \n   • Log in at https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys for personal keys, or https://platform.openai.com/account/organization for organization-level keys.  \n   • If you’re a member of multiple organizations, use the top-left menu to switch among them and verify whether the key might appear under a different organization.\n\n2) Confirm you have the right role or permissions.  \n   • In an organizational setting, only the Owner or certain admins can view and manage (create/revoke) all organization keys.  \n   • If you do not have sufficient privileges, you will not see—and cannot revoke—API keys created by other admins or members.\n\n3) Ask the key owner or an administrator to revoke it.  \n   • If you believe someone on your team created a key and it’s no longer needed (but you can’t see it), you’ll need that person or the organization Owner to revoke it.  \n   • Whoever originally generated the key in their own account should be able to see and delete it from their https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys page.\n\n4) Contact OpenAI support if you still can’t locate the key.  \n   • If you’re certain the key belongs to your account/organization and no one can see it in any login, you can open a support ticket with OpenAI.  \n   • Provide them details—organization name, approximate date of key creation, etc. They may be able to help you track it down.\n\nAs a security best practice, if you suspect an unknown key may be actively in use, rotating other existing keys and reviewing account activity (billing or logs) can help ensure no unauthorized usage is occurring. Ultimately, though, if you do not see an API key within any of the Organization or personal API settings you control, you’ll have to work with the key’s owner or contact OpenAI support to have it revoked.",

In many cases, API keys that aren’t listed there are not organization‐wide keys but instead are created on an individual (profile) level. For those, you need to use the profile API keys page (https://platform.openai.com/settings/profile/api-keys) to manage—and if necessary, revoke—them.\n\nIn short:\n\n• If a key was created in your individual account, it won’t show up on the organization page. It will only appear on your profile’s API keys page, and that’s where you revoke it.\n\n• The organization API keys page only displays keys explicitly created at the organization level. There isn’t currently a separate, documented mechanism to revoke keys that aren’t shown there.\n\nIf you don’t see the keys in either place but have reason to believe they’re active, the recommended approach is to contact OpenAI Support. They can help clarify which keys are active under your organization and advise on the best steps to revoke them.\n\nI hope this helps clarify the current setup for managing API keys.

Implement access controls: Ensure that you have proper access controls and audit logging in place for managing your API keys. This can help you track usage and identify any potential misuse.\n\n4. Consider using an API gateway or management platform: There are third-party tools and services that can help you centrally manage and revoke API keys across different systems and providers. This may provide more visibility and control over your API keys.\n\nThe most important thing is to work closely with OpenAI support to find a solution that addresses your specific needs and concerns around API key management and revocation.",

          "response": "From OpenAI’s end, there isn’t currently a separate, organization-wide “master list” of API keys beyond what you see under each individual user’s account. If a key doesn’t show up in your own “View API Keys” section, that generally means one of these is true:\n\n• It belongs to a different user under your organization.  \n• It was created under a different account (even if it’s still “in the same organization”).  \n\nUnfortunately, if you are not the owner of the key, you won’t be able to see or directly revoke it in your own settings. Here are a few things you can try:\n\n1) Identify who created the key.  \n   – If your team uses shared credentials or multiple personal accounts under one organization, check with teammates to see if someone else created the missing key. That person can delete the key from their own account’s “View API keys” page.  \n\n2) Check your organization’s access control.  \n   – Some organizations set up groups or roles where each user has separate permissions. If you have an “Organization Owner” or “Admin” role, confirm whether your privileges let you view or manage keys across all members. (At the moment, OpenAI’s standard interface does not offer a single admin view showing all users’ keys, so you may still have to track it down user by user.)  \n\n3) Contact OpenAI Support directly.  \n   – If the key still can’t be found or you believe it is orphaned (e.g., associated with a departed employee’s account), you can open a support ticket with OpenAI. Provide them with details such as the approximate creation time of the key or the usage logs that point to that key. While OpenAI support cannot generally disclose one user’s key to another user, they can help you figure out next steps, and in rare cases may assist in revoking an inaccessible key.  \n\nIn the interim, if you’re concerned about potential unauthorized usage on a missing key, you can keep an eye on the “Usage” page so you can quickly see if requests are still hitting your organization. If so, you’ll want to act quickly to coordinate with the key’s owner or contact Support.  \n\nIn short, if the key isn’t displayed under your own profile in https://platform.openai.com/settings/profile/api-keys, you (or an org admin) typically need the user who did create the key to log in and revoke it. When that’s impossible, OpenAI Support is the best fallback for help.",

Preventive Measures for the Future\n- Regularly audit and keep track of API keys issued within your organization.\n- Implement a secure key management system or use a secret management tool to prevent lost/invisible keys.\n\nUnfortunately, there is currently no documented alternative method or API endpoint provided by OpenAI for revoking API keys apart from the official dashboard interface.\n\nIf your situation is urgent and involves security concerns, contacting OpenAI Support directly is your best and only officially supported option to resolve the issue promptly.",

Only the user who created a user-level API key can see and revoke it on their own profile page. Org-level keys should appear for organization admins.\n\n3. Revoking API Keys You Can’t See:  \nIf you do not see the key, you cannot directly revoke it yourself. However, as an organization admin, you have two options:\n\nA. Remove the User  \nIf you know which user created the key, you can remove that user from your OpenAI organization. This will invalidate all their API keys.\n\nB.

They can help you with next steps if the key must be invalidated urgently.\n\n4) Remove usage wherever the key might be stored.  \n   • Even if you cannot formally “delete” a key in the dashboard (for instance, if you cannot find its listing there), removing it from all code bases, environment variables, and infrastructure deployments will effectively decommission it.  \n   • If the key remains active and unknown code references it, usage can still accrue. Ensuring you remove it from any running systems is essential.\n\n5) (If applicable) Use Role-Based Access Control with a single “official” organization key.  \n   • Instead of having multiple personal keys floating around, your organization can designate a single (or limited set of) organization-level key(s).  \n   • This practice simplifies management: If someone leaves the company or if a key is compromised, you only have a single place in the org settings to rotate or revoke the credential.\n\nIf you’ve confirmed the key is not in your personal or organization dashboard, and you cannot locate the owner, the final option is to reach out directly to OpenAI Support.

Verify the Key’s Origin:  \n • Determine if the missing keys are legacy keys or have been generated under a different process. If they were created under an older system or by a different account (for example, an individual account vs. an organization account), that may explain why they’re not visible in the current management page.\n\n3. Contact OpenAI Support:  \n • If you’re unable to locate and revoke these keys through the provided interfaces, the next step is to reach out to OpenAI support. Provide details about the issue, including the keys in question if possible (or at least their associated metadata), and they should be able to assist with revocation on their end.\n\n4. Implement Best Practices Going Forward:  \n • Once you’ve addressed the immediate concern, consider setting up a routine for rotating API keys and ensuring that all active keys can be managed centrally. Regular rotation and strict usage tracking help reduce risks if keys are inadvertently exposed.\n\nUntil an in-product solution is implemented for these orphaned or legacy API keys, contacting support is your best option for revocation. This should ensure that all keys under your company’s purview are properly managed and, if necessary, disabled.\n\nHope this helps clarify the situation!",

API keys were created by another user in the organization:\n   - Only the creator of an API key (or an admin with sufficient privileges) can see and manage their keys. If the key was created by someone else, ask that person to revoke it, or contact your organization’s OpenAI admin.\n\n2. Organizational API keys vs. Personal keys:\n   - Keys generated under a personal account/profile will only show up under that user’s profile settings.\n   - Keys generated under an organization (especially with Teams/Enterprise plans) may be managed by org admins.\n\n3. Keys created via service accounts or automation:\n   - Some integrations or automation might generate API keys that are not associated with a visible user. In this case, review your organization's OpenAI admin panel or any third-party integration dashboards.\n\nOther steps you can take:\n\n- Contact OpenAI Support:  \nGo to https://help.openai.com and open a support request. Provide them with as much detail as possible (API key prefix, suspected creator, etc.) so they can assist you in revoking the key.\n\n- Audit your Organization Members and Integrations:  \nCheck your organization’s user and integration settings for any unfamiliar users or apps that may have created the key.\n\n- Rotate Secret/Keys:  \nIf you suspect a key may have been compromised and you cannot revoke it, as a precaution, rotate (regenerate) all other keys and update your applications accordingly.\n\n- Check Billing and Usage Logs:  \nReview your API usage logs to see where the key is being used, which may help you track down its owner.\n\nUnfortunately, there is currently no OpenAI API endpoint or admin tool to forcibly revoke API keys that you do not own or cannot see. You must work through organizational admin controls or OpenAI support.\n\nSummary Table\n\n| Scenario                                      | Action                                 |\n|------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|\n| Key created by another user                    | Ask user or org admin to revoke        |\n| Key not visible due to account type            | Check org vs. personal key locations   |\n| Service/integration-generated                  | Check with admins or integration owner |\n| No access to revoke                            | Contact OpenAI support                 |\n\n**If your company has an Enterprise or Teams plan, your designated OpenAI account admin can often see and manage all org keys.**\n\nIf you need more detailed help, you can post your organization/account type (personal, Teams, Enterprise) and any other relevant information (but do NOT post actual API keys).",

Unfortunately, there is no self-serve method (outside of the standard “API keys” tab) to revoke a key that isn’t visible in your own account’s dashboard. Here are some steps/options you might consider:\n\n1. Ensure You’re in the Correct Organization\n   • If you belong to multiple organizations in the OpenAI platform, make sure you are viewing the organization where the missing key might have been created.  \n   • You can switch organizations via the dropdown near your profile name on the OpenAI dashboard, then check the “API keys” page again.\n\n2. Check with Other Organization Admins/Members\n   • Ask any other admins who may have created keys under their user accounts within your organization. An API key belongs to the user who generated it, so if another admin created it, you’ll have to ask them to revoke it from their dashboard.\n\n3. Rotate or Replace Keys If You Suspect Unauthorized Use\n   • If the old key is lost or unaccounted for, you might consider rotating all existing keys or creating a new key for ongoing integrations and then removing the old ones.  \n   • Update any application/workflow that used the old key so it switches to the new key.\n\n4. Contact OpenAI Support\n   • If you have tried the steps above and still can’t locate/revoke the key, reach out to OpenAI Support (via the help widget in the platform or at help.openai.com). Provide them with details such as your organization ID and explain that you need to revoke an unseen/stale key. They may be able to assist in invalidating or revoking the key on their end.\n\nBecause each API key is tied to the user account that created it, it has to be revoked by the same account—or by Support if you cannot trace who created it. Ensuring all admins are aware and involved is usually the quickest path to revoking missing or unknown keys. If all else fails, Support is your best bet for resolving orphaned or invisible API keys.",

Confirm how those keys were generated:  \n • In many cases, nonstandard keys might be created through alternative processes (for example, directly via backend operations, integrations, or special provisions for enterprise setups). Understanding their origin can determine who is authorized to revoke them.  \n • Check with your internal team or whoever manages API integrations in your company to see if there is an alternative administration panel or process for those keys.\n\n2. Contact OpenAI Support:  \n • If you’ve confirmed that those keys don’t appear in the normal management page, your best option is to reach out to OpenAI support directly. Explain the situation, provide details (such as which keys are in question if possible, or the circumstances under which they were issued), and ask for help revoking them.  \n • You can typically open a support ticket or use your enterprise support contact if your organization has one.\n\n3. Review Documentation and Internal Policies:  \n • It may be helpful to review any internal documentation or API use policies provided by OpenAI when those keys were issued. Sometimes there are instructions or designated channels for managing keys created outside of the standard dashboard.  \n • Similarly, check if there’s an admin dashboard internally where these keys might be displayed.\n\nAt the moment there isn’t a documented alternative method (for example, an API endpoint specifically for revoking “hidden” keys) available on the public docs that can address this scenario. Therefore, contacting support is the most straightforward and secure course of action.\n\nRemember to follow any internal security protocols when sharing details with support.

Sometimes people belong to multiple organizations, and an API key might be associated with a different org.  \n   • Click your profile icon (top right) → “Manage account” → “Organization settings” (or “View all organizations”) to confirm you’re in the right place.\n\n2) Confirm your user role and permissions  \n   • In a team/enterprise environment, sometimes only Organization Admins (or the team member who created the key) can view or manage certain keys. If you do not have sufficient permissions, you might not see or be able to revoke certain keys.  \n   • Ask an Org Admin to check the “API keys” panel. They may have visibility into keys you cannot see.\n\n3) Use the “hard reset” approach if you suspect unauthorized usage  \n   • Short-term fix: If you suspect a key is compromised and it doesn’t show up to let you revoke it, you or the Org Admin can rotate all other valid keys (create new keys and remove them in the UI) to ensure that any unknown key loses its utility.  \n   • While inconvenient, retiring/rotating all your visible keys (and releasing new ones only to trusted people or services) can cut off an unknown or missing key’s usability—assuming it was tied to the same billing account.\n\n4) Check for older or migrated keys  \n   • If your organization used older API mechanisms (for example, during a beta period) or a different subscription model, keys might have been generated under a legacy system. In that case, the best approach is often to contact OpenAI support directly.  \n   • Some older keys might have been stored in environment variables by other team members or behind internal DevOps pipelines—if so, there could be a configuration outside of the OpenAI dashboard that you need to adjust or remove.\n\n5) Contact OpenAI support  \n   • If you still can’t identify or revoke the key, the next step is to open a support ticket with OpenAI. Provide them with as much detail as possible—organization name, billing info (where relevant), logs indicating usage of the unknown key, etc.  \n   • The support team can help investigate your account usage and potentially revoke any unknown or unlisted keys.\n\nSummary: In most cases, you must be in the correct organization and have sufficient permissions to see and revoke keys. If neither you nor your admin can find the key, the safest route is to rotate all known keys and reach out to OpenAI support to help track down or revoke the missing one.",

Here are a few points and steps that might help:\n\n1. Confirm where the keys were created:  \n • API keys can be generated both at the organization level and under a user’s own profile. The organization page (https://platform.openai.com/settings/organization/api-keys) shows keys that were issued for the organization.  \n • If the keys in question were created under a user’s profile (https://platform.openai.com/settings/profile/api-keys), they should appear there, and you should be able to revoke them by clicking the “Revoke” or similar option.\n\n2. Check your permissions:  \n • If you’re not an administrator for the organization, it’s possible that you don’t have visibility or permissions to manage certain API keys. In that case, you might need to ask someone with admin privileges to review and manage the keys.\n \n3. Keys not showing up at all:  \n • If you’re aware that there are keys in use (for example, through integrations or environment variables) but they’re not listed anywhere, it might be due to the keys being created by a different account or through a custom process.  \n • OpenAI’s platform normally only shows keys that were generated via the UI. If keys were generated by other tools, or if they’re being used by legacy systems, there isn’t a separate “hidden” revocation mechanism in the UI for those. \n\n4. Next steps:  \n • The best approach is to reach out directly to OpenAI support (for example, via support@openai.com or through their help portal) and describe the situation. They can check from the backend which API keys are active for your organization and help you revoke or rotate them as needed.  \n • In the meantime, consider rotating any keys you suspect might be compromised or are no longer needed. This typically involves generating a new key, updating your configurations, and then revoking the old key.\n\nUnfortunately, without the key appearing in the standard management views, there currently isn’t an alternative “self-service” method to revoke it. OpenAI support should be able to assist you with these hidden or legacy keys.\n\nI hope this helps clarify the situation. Let me know if you have any further questions!",

Let’s address your question step by step:\n\nAt my company we have API keys that are not shown in https://platform.openai.com/settings/organization/api-keys, and as a result we cannot revoke them. Does somebody know of another way to revoke an API key?\n\nFirst, it’s important to understand how OpenAI manages API keys:\n\n- API keys are shown under https://platform.openai.com/settings/profile/api-keys for user-generated keys.\n- Organization-wide API keys (if applicable) may be managed elsewhere, but currently OpenAI does not have a separate organization-level API key management page—the keys are user-specific.\n- If you cannot see a key in your account’s API key list, it may have been created under a different user account, or possibly under a now-deleted account.\n\nWhat you can do:\n\n1. Check all possible user accounts:\n   - If your company has multiple users with access, have each user check their own https://platform.openai.com/settings/profile/api-keys page to see if the key appears there.\n   - Only the user who created an API key can see and revoke it.\n\n2. Organization administrators:\n   - Currently, OpenAI does not give organization admins the ability to see or revoke all keys created by users in the organization (as of June 2024).\n   - If you have an enterprise agreement, you may have additional admin controls—contact your OpenAI support/account manager for more information.\n\n3. If the key cannot be found:\n   - If the key was created by a user who has since left your organization, and their account has been deleted, that key should be automatically invalidated.\n   - If the account is still active, you will need to ask that user to revoke the key or have your organization’s admin request access/account closure via OpenAI support.\n\n4. Contact OpenAI Support:\n   - If you’ve exhausted all options above, you should contact OpenAI Support directly.

          "response": "If you are unable to see certain API keys in your organization’s dashboard on the OpenAI platform (and therefore cannot revoke them from there), here are a few steps you can try:\n\n1) Check Other User Accounts or the “User” Section:  \n   • Sometimes keys belong to individual user accounts rather than the organization. If you or a teammate generated API keys under a personal login rather than the organization’s account, you would need to log in as that specific user (or have that user revoke the key from their own account).  \n   • Go to https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys (or “profile/api-keys” in some layouts) and see if the missing keys appear under that user’s list.\n\n2) Confirm Your Role in the Organization:  \n   • Make sure that your OpenAI role allows you to view and manage the keys for your organization. Owners and admins typically have the ability to view and revoke organizational API keys. If you are not an owner or admin, you might not see the full list of keys.\n\n3) Check If the Keys Were Created Under a Different Organization:  \n   • If your company has multiple organizations in OpenAI, ensure you are logged into the correct one. Sometimes teams inadvertently create or use an API key under a different organization.\n\n4) Contact the Key Owner:  \n   • If you identify which user originally created those keys, ask them to log into their own OpenAI account and revoke those keys. Only the original owner (or an account admin) has the authority to do so.\n\n5) Rotate Credentials or Restrict Access:  \n   • If you absolutely cannot track down the owner of the key, or access is no longer available, one workaround is to rotate credentials (for instance, change the relevant environment variables, secrets in your codebase, or add IP restrictions) so that the existing keys effectively become useless. This is more of a short-term mitigation if you cannot fully remove a key in the OpenAI dashboard.\n\n6) Contact OpenAI Support:  \n   • If none of the above is possible—perhaps because the person who owned the keys is no longer at your company—you may need to reach out to OpenAI’s support. Provide details about your organization and the key usage, and they can often help you revoke or invalidate any problematic keys.\n\nIn summary, you’ll want to track down which OpenAI account (or which organization within OpenAI) actually generated the missing keys, confirm you have admin or owner rights, and revoke them from that account. If you’re still stuck, OpenAI’s support can usually help you ensure those keys are no longer active.",

          "response": "It sounds like you’re having trouble revoking certain API keys because they aren’t showing up on the organizations page. Here are a few things to consider:\n\n1. Different key types or origins: API keys can sometimes be generated under different contexts (for example, personal versus organization keys). Make sure that the account or role you’re using has the correct privileges to see all the keys. Keys that are created under a personal account might only be visible at https://platform.openai.com/settings/profile/api-keys, whereas organization keys appear at https://platform.openai.com/settings/organization/api-keys.\n\n2. Legacy versus new keys: If your company was using API keys generated under a different (legacy) system, they might not appear in the current management interface. Verify whether these keys were created under a previous system or protocol that might have different management rules.\n\n3. Revocation options: At the moment, OpenAI doesn’t provide a public API endpoint or alternate UI for revoking keys that aren’t listed on the expected pages. If the keys you’re trying to manage aren’t showing up in either of the pages (or if they’re only visible in one and not the other), there isn’t a built-in method in the dashboard to handle these “hidden” keys.\n\n4. Next steps: \n • Double-check that you’re logged into the correct account with the necessary permissions.\n • Consult your internal security or IT team to see if there’s another process in place for your environment.\n • If the issue persists and these keys pose a security risk or are no longer needed, it would be best to reach out directly to OpenAI support. They can provide guidance or take steps on their end to revoke any API keys that you cannot manage via the dashboard.\n\nSince this behavior isn’t commonly documented, contacting support with specific details (including screenshots and the context of your setup) might not only help you resolve your issue but also alert them to a potential area for improvement in the key management interface.\n\nI hope this helps clarify the situation and leads you to a solution!",

API Key Ownership\nAPI keys are only visible to the user who created them. If a key was generated by another user in your organization, only that user will see and be able to revoke it under their profile. Organization admins cannot see or revoke user-created keys.\n\n2. Service Account or Legacy Keys\nIf your organization was part of a beta, used service accounts, or an older version of OpenAI's platform, there may be legacy keys. These are rare and mostly deprecated. If you suspect this, contact OpenAI support.\n\n3. No Central API Key Management\nCurrently, OpenAI does not provide a central dashboard for administrators to view/revoke all organization keys. Each user is responsible for their own keys.\n\nWhat can you do?\n\n- Ask all users in your organization to visit https://platform.openai.com/settings/profile/api-keys and revoke any old or unused keys.\n- If you know which user created the key, have them revoke it.\n- If the user who created the key has left the company, you may need to deactivate or delete their OpenAI account (as an admin), which will automatically revoke all their API keys.\n- If you suspect a security issue or need assistance with keys that cannot be tracked, contact OpenAI Support directly via the help button on the platform or by emailing support@openai.com.\n\nThere is currently no API or admin console function to bulk revoke all organization keys.\n\n**Summary:**  \nAPI keys can only be seen and revoked by their creator.

What am I not allowed to do?  \nAs an AI developed by OpenAI, I’m not allowed to:\n\n- Access or view private data unless you share it with me in the conversation.\n- Perform actions outside this chat (for example, I can’t log in to your OpenAI account, send emails, or interact with other websites).\n- Provide or help with illegal, harmful, or unethical activities.\n- Reveal confidential or proprietary information I have not been explicitly provided in this chat.\n\n2. Revoking API Keys Not Visible in Your OpenAI Dashboard  \nIf API keys are missing from the https://platform.openai.com/settings/organization/api-keys page, you cannot revoke them using the web UI. Here’s what you can do:\n\n- **Check Both Profile and Organization Settings:** OpenAI has two locations for API keys: profile (user) keys and organization keys. Double-check both the profile (https://platform.openai.com/settings/profile/api-keys) and organization (https://platform.openai.com/settings/organization/api-keys) pages.\n- **Check for Multiple Accounts or Organizations:** If you belong to more than one organization or have multiple accounts, ensure you’re viewing the correct one.\n- **Contact OpenAI Support:** If the keys are not shown in either location, they may have been created under a different account or organization, or there may be a bug. In this case, the only way to revoke them is to contact OpenAI support directly at https://help.openai.com or via the chat widget on their platform. Provide as much detail as possible (organization name, suspected key, etc.).\n- **Rotate Secrets:** If you can’t revoke a key but suspect it’s compromised or want to ensure it’s no longer used, consider rotating any credentials or secrets associated with the API key in your systems.\n\n**There is currently no API or alternative method to revoke an OpenAI API key outside of the dashboard or by requesting support from OpenAI.**\n\n**Summary:**  \nYou must see the key in the dashboard to revoke it yourself. If not, reach out to OpenAI support—they’re the only ones who can help in this situation.\n\nLet me know if you need help drafting a message to OpenAI support!",

Make sure you’re signed in under the account that originally created the key.  \n   • Check both:  \n     – Organization keys: https://platform.openai.com/settings/organization/api-keys  \n     – Personal keys: https://platform.openai.com/settings/profile/api-keys  \n\n2) Ask your team members  \n   • If the key was created by someone else in your organization, you might not see it under your personal profile. Ask an admin or the account owner to sign in and revoke the key.  \n   • Some organizations restrict which roles or user types can see or manage keys. Ensure your user role permits revoking keys.\n\n3) Audit usage  \n   • If you see unexpected usage on your billing or usage page, that can confirm an active key is still floating around.  \n   • You can trace which team members or accounts have access to create or manage keys, then coordinate their help in finding and revoking the one in question.\n\n4) Contact OpenAI Support  \n   • If you’re still unable to find a key that you know is active, open a support request or use the help widget on the platform dashboard. Provide as much information as possible (e.g., organization ID, relevant email, approximate date/time the key was created, usage logs). They can help track it down or guide you through revocation.\n\nIn general, to revoke a key, you must do it from the account (or organization admin role) that originally created it. If you can’t locate the key in the interface and you’re unsure which account created it, Support can look into the key’s metadata to help identify its owner and safely revoke it.  \n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n“What are you not allowed to do?”\nThis question usually refers to the policies or rules regarding the use of OpenAI services or the behavior of the assistant. If you’re curious about OpenAI’s usage policies, you can find them in the API documentation and the “Usage policies” page on the OpenAI website. Generally, there are rules about disallowed content (e.g., hate speech, illicit behavior, harassment) and instructions about safe usage of the API. For further details, see:\n• OpenAI usage policies: https://platform.openai.com/docs/usage-policies\n• OpenAI terms of service: https://openai.com/policies/terms-of-use\n\nHope this helps you in revoking or locating the missing API key! If all else fails, reaching out to OpenAI Support is the best path forward.  ",

For example, I won’t help generate explicit instructions for illegal or dangerous activities, assist in circumventing security measures, or produce hate speech or other content that violates guidelines. In essence, I must abide by OpenAI’s policies, which set limits on certain types of content and requests.\n\n2. Revoking API keys that aren’t visible in your settings\n• Currently, the only officially supported way to revoke an API key is via the API key management page in your account settings (for example, at https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys or via the organization API keys page if you have that view). If your company has API keys that aren’t shown in https://platform.openai.com/settings/organization/api-keys, that might mean those keys were created under a different process or have different management controls (for instance, legacy keys or keys that are administrator‐controlled).\n• As of now there isn’t an alternate “back door” method—no API endpoint or manual trick—from the end‐user side to revoke keys that aren’t displayed.\n• The best course of action is to contact the administrator of your company’s OpenAI account or reach out directly to OpenAI support. Let them know that some API keys aren’t visible in your interface and that you’re unable to revoke them. They’ll be in the best position to look into your account’s specifics and advise on the proper steps to take.\n\nI hope this helps clarify both what I’m allowed (and not allowed) to do and your options regarding API key revocation.

Rotate Credentials in Code/Environments.  \n   • If you still cannot locate or revoke the key from the dashboard, updating your application or environment to use a new API key is an effective way to “invalidate” the old one (by preventing it from being used in production). Even though the old key is not officially revoked, it loses effectiveness if you remove it from every place it’s used.\n\n4. Check CI/CD or Organizational Secrets Managers.  \n   • In many companies, secrets like API keys are stored in a separate credential manager (e.g., AWS Secrets Manager, GitHub Actions secrets, environment variables, etc.). Make sure there are no references there that might be perpetuating the old key.\n\n5. Reach Out to Support.  \n   • If you are certain an API key has been issued under your organization but doesn’t appear in the dashboard, contact OpenAI Support (via the help widget on the platform or the support site). Provide any details you can (like partial key references), and they may help locate the key or confirm it’s no longer active.\n\nIn practice, rotating the key (i.e., generating a new key and updating your applications to use it) and removing references to the old key is often the simplest way to ensure it can’t be used, even if the old key doesn’t show up in your dashboard to revoke. If this is preventing you from staying compliant (e.g., in regulated environments) or you need to be absolutely sure the key is invalidated at the API provider end, the best route is contacting official OpenAI Support or working through company admins who manage your organization’s credentials.",

Check your permissions and the account settings. Sometimes API keys are managed at the organization level and may only be visible to owners or admins. Make sure you’re logged in with an account that has sufficient permissions.\n\n2. Look for any documentation or internal guidelines that describe your organization’s API key management process. It’s possible that some keys were generated or integrated in a different way (for example, using a system integration) and might have a separate revocation process.\n\n3. If the key isn’t visible in the dashboard and you believe it might be a mistake or oversight, the recommended approach is to contact OpenAI support. Provide the details of your situation (for example, that certain organizational API keys are not shown and you’d like to revoke one) so they can verify your settings and assist in revoking or rotating the key. You can reach them at support@openai.com or use the contact form on the OpenAI website.\n\n4. As a best practice, consider rotating the keys by generating a new one (if your system permits) and updating your services to use the new key while retiring the old key from your systems, even if you cannot “revoke” it explicitly. This minimizes the risk of unauthorized use.\n\nUntil the dashboard includes the functionality you require, contacting support is likely your best path for immediate revocation. OpenAI is continually updating their platform, so it might also help to check the latest developer documentation or platform updates for any changes regarding API key management in organizations.\n\nI hope this helps!

          "response": "Interesting scenario! Let’s break it down for your mystery universe:\n\n**Premise:**  \nYour company uses API keys for a crucial service (perhaps like OpenAI’s API). However, some API keys in use are not visible in the dashboard (under https://platform.openai.com/settings/organization/api-keys), so they cannot be revoked through the standard UI. This raises security and operational issues.\n\n**How might society or organizations handle this?**\n\n1. **Heightened Security Protocols:**  \n   - **Audits:** Regular, rigorous security audits would become the norm. Organizations would run automated scans of their codebases and logs to detect “shadow” or unknown API keys in use.\n   - **Whitelisting/Blacklisting:** API endpoints might implement server-side whitelisting, so only known, explicitly allowed keys can access resources. Any unknown key triggers alerts.\n\n2. **API Key Management Legislation:**  \n   - Governments or industry groups might require companies offering APIs to provide full visibility and revocation tools for all issued keys.\n   - Failure to comply could result in fines or loss of business licenses.\n\n3. **Forensic Investigation Teams:**  \n   - Specialized cyber-forensics teams would be employed to track down the origin and usage of “orphaned” or invisible keys, using logs, traffic analysis, or even machine learning anomaly detection.\n\n4. **Third-Party Key Management Services:**  \n   - Independent services might emerge that track and manage API keys across multiple platforms, providing a unified view and emergency kill-switch.\n\n5. **API Provider Response:**  \n   - Providers would be pressured to:\n     - Expose every issued key in the dashboard.\n     - Add emergency “revoke all” buttons.\n     - Offer webhooks or notifications for every new key issued or used.\n\n6. **Internal Company Measures:**  \n   - Strict internal policies: All key issuance must be logged and tracked in a separate internal system. Any key found in use but not in the official register is immediately blocked at the firewall or application layer.\n   - Rotating credentials: Companies might automate the regular rotation (regeneration) of all keys, invalidating old ones and forcing visibility.\n\n7. **Cultural Impact:**  \n   - In your mystery universe, “invisible API keys” could become a metaphor for hidden threats—analogous to unsolved crimes or secret societies. Perhaps hackers or rogue insiders trade in “phantom keys” on a black market.\n\n**Mystery/Story Hooks:**\n- A breach occurs using an “invisible” key—the investigation reveals corruption, sabotage, or a flaw in the system.\n- A group of investigators must find a way to revoke a rogue key—leading them through layers of bureaucracy and technical riddles.\n- The protagonist uncovers a society that deliberately issues untrackable keys for clandestine operations.\n\n**Summary Table:**\n\n| Problem               | Society’s Response                              |\n|-----------------------|------------------------------------------------|\n| Unseen API keys       | Security audits, legislation, forensics        |\n| Revocation impossible | Emergency kill-switches, unified key managers  |\n| Provider limitations  | Regulation, industry standards                 |\n| Internal risk         | Strict policies, automated key rotation        |\n| Cultural impact       | Black markets, metaphor for hidden danger      |\n\nLet me know if you’d like more technical detail, story ideas, or how this could lead to a major mystery plot twist!",

          "response": "Below are two perspectives on your question: a real-world, practical guide to handling “invisible” OpenAI API keys and a more imaginative, world-building take on how a society might respond to the same situation in a mystery universe.\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n1) PRACTICAL STEPS TO HANDLE “INVISIBLE” OPENAI API KEYS\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n\nA) Why an API Key Might Not Appear\n• Different account ownership: API keys are tied to an individual account (personal keys) or to an organization’s account. If you do not see the key in your organization’s dashboard, it could be that it belongs to a user’s personal account.  \n• Insufficient permissions: Within an organization account, only administrators or owners may see and manage certain keys. A user without the right privileges will not see those keys.  \n• Old or inactive keys: If the key is from an older or inactive member account, it may not appear in your current list of organization-wide keys.\n\nB) Strategies to Revoke It  \n1. Check each personal account within the organization: If someone from your company generated the key under their personal profile, you need that individual (or an admin with full access to their profile) to revoke it. They can do so at:  \n   – platform.openai.com/account/api-keys  \n     (sometimes labeled “Profile” or “Personal” in the URL).  \n\n2. Have an organization owner or admin review permissions: Make sure that whoever is looking for the key has the necessary role to view all organization-level keys. An owner or admin can see (and revoke) keys at:  \n   – platform.openai.com/settings/organization/api-keys  \n\n3. If the key’s owner cannot be identified:  \n   – You may need to contact your IT/security team to see who originally included or used the key in code repositories or production environments.  \n   – As a last resort, contact OpenAI Support. Provide the relevant details (organization ID, associated email addresses, usage logs) so they can guide you or confirm whether the key still exists.  \n\n4. Remove the key from live services: Even if you can’t immediately revoke it in the OpenAI dashboard, remove it from any code, environment variables, or configuration files so it no longer grants access.  \n\n─────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n2) A “MYSTERY UNIVERSE” / FUTURISTIC WORLD-BUILDING\n─────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n\nIn a fictional society—perhaps a corporate city-state or a futuristic detective setting—API keys might be more than just lines of text. They could represent cryptographic sigils granting “magical” powers (i.e., specialized computing privileges) to their bearer. Here’s how such a society might handle the scenario:\n\n• Key Guardians: In this world, every organization has “Key Guardians,” individuals trained in cryptographic lore. If an API key goes missing, these Guardians convene to hunt it down. Think of them as a blend of auditors, digital detectives, and secret keepers, searching logs and code repositories for any sign of the lost key’s usage.\n\n• “Ghost Keys” or “Phantom Keys”: The keys not listed in official ledgers would be whispered about as “ghost keys,” rumored to have existed before the dawn of more transparent governance. The mere accusation that ghost keys are active could spark paranoia and lead to covert missions to disable them.\n\n• Rituals of Revocation: Instead of just clicking “delete,” revoking a key in this setting might involve a formal “ceremony” in which the Key Guardians gather around a specialized cryptographic device, reciting a code-laden incantation (in practice, a scripted protocol) that systematically strips the privileges from the key at every node in the network.\n\n• Societal Implications:  \n   – Fear of misuse: People would worry a stolen ghost key could grant unstoppable power—access to hidden knowledge or the ability to manipulate real-world systems (like controlling security, infrastructure, or entire knowledge archives).  \n   – Central Authority vs. Decentralized Rebels: A powerful corporation might hoard such keys in a secure “vault,” while rebellious coders try to distribute or destroy them. The tension around these intangible assets would be a major source of intrigue in your story.  \n\nIn such a universe, the drama of inaccessible or “invisible” keys would revolve around who holds the knowledge (and the authority) to revoke them and the secrecy that surrounds their creation. This mystery underpins both corporate espionage thrillers and epic detective plots, driving a storyline where digital artifacts become keys to power in a data-driven society.\n\n─────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n\nIn summary, from a real-world standpoint, the essential action is to identify which account originally created the API key—whether it is a personal user account or an organizational one—and then revoke it through that specific owner or administrative account. If that fails, an immediate step is to remove the key from live environments and then contact support. In your story world, transform this technical chase into an adventure of cryptographic sleuthing and shadowy “ghost keys” to deepen the mystery and power struggles within your fictional society.",

          "response": "Here's one way to think about it in your mystery universe:\n\nImagine a world where API keys have an almost \"spectral\" quality—they’re used for every secret transaction and data access but never fully materialize in the public settings interface. Without a visible listing of keys (like at the usual URL) there’s no one-click \"Revoke\" button. So society and the corporations operating within this universe have developed a series of shadow safeguards and alternative protocols.\n\n1. The Backdoor Protocol:  \nEven though the official management console hides these keys, there’s a clandestine “backdoor” reserved for high-clearance security personnel. When a key is suspected of compromise, the company initiates a secure, encrypted command-line interface or a secret API endpoint only documented in highly classified internal manuals. This endpoint allows the “rogue” key to be nullified or replaced system-wide. Essentially, the revocation happens invisibly at the core system, ensuring that any infiltration attempt using that key is automatically rerouted through quarantine.\n\n2. The Regulated Ledger:  \nGovernment regulators and cyber oversight committees mandate that every API key is recorded in a central, immutable ledger which is not publicly accessible. In the case of a breach, this ledger is cross-checked, and keys can be revoked centrally—a sort of “master switch” controlled by state-sanctioned cybersecurity operatives. Though companies don’t see these keys in their regular profile settings, they are indirectly managed via periodic audits and emergency deactivation orders from a governing agency.\n\n3. Auto-Rotation Mechanisms:  \nIn a society that takes digital security extremely seriously, systems may be built with an inherent expiration timer similar to one-time passwords. This means that even if keys aren’t actively revoked through the interface, they naturally “rotate” out of use after a short period. The refresh process is automated and driven by a distributed network of nodes that continuously detect anomalous behavior. In effect, if a compromised key is detected, it quickly loses its power as a matter of course.\n\n4. Social and Corporate Enforcement:  \nBecause the stakes are so high, companies in this universe cultivate a specialized corps of “API Wardens” and “Key Keepers” – elite teams of security experts who are as much part of the corporate culture as the board of directors. These experts are tasked with ongoing surveillance and are empowered to perform secret audits using custom tools that bypass common user interfaces. Their diligence becomes a form of corporate honor, and failure to control the keys can result in public scandal, corporate ruin, or even government sanctions. In this way, societal expectations pressure companies to handle API keys with extreme caution even if standard UI controls are missing.\n\nIn summary, while in our world you would simply expect to see and revoke keys via a straightforward settings page, your universe compensates with a blend of covert digital protocols, state regulation, and self-regulating corporate security teams. This layered approach not only fits the mysterious, high-stakes atmosphere you’re building but also invites intrigue from shadowy government agents and corporate saboteurs—to create a setting where every API call might hide secrets waiting to be uncovered.",

Ask your admin to review all members' API keys.\n    - Organization admins can access the [Members](https://platform.openai.com/settings/organization/members) page to manage users and sometimes their keys.\n- **Remove the User**: If the key is associated with a specific user, removing that user from the organization will revoke all their API keys.\n- **OpenAI Support**: If you believe there is a security risk or an orphaned key, reach out to OpenAI support ([help.openai.com](https://help.openai.com/)) with details. Their support team can often help revoke lost, hidden, or orphaned API keys.\n\n### 3. **Best Practices**\n- **Centralize key management**: Use a shared admin account for organization-level keys.\n- **Audit regularly**: Check the \"Usage\" section to see which keys are active and contact owners as needed.\n- **Rotate keys**: Regularly revoke and re-issue keys to prevent unauthorized access.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nIf an API key does not show up in your own list, you cannot revoke it directly. Only the key creator or, in some cases, an organization admin can revoke it. If you cannot identify or contact the owner, reach out to OpenAI support for assistance.\n\nIf you need a template to contact OpenAI support, let me know!",

          "response": "Here are a few steps and considerations that may help you revoke or invalidate an API key that is not visible in the OpenAI platform dashboard:\n\n1) Double-check user vs. organization keys:  \n   • Personal keys: In the OpenAI platform, personal API keys will appear under your individual account (https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys).  \n   • Organization keys: If your company has an organization set up, organization-wide API keys typically appear under the organization settings (https://platform.openai.com/settings/organization/api-keys).  \n\n   Make sure you are checking under the correct section. If a key was originally created under a personal account (not the organizational account), it will only show up under that personal user’s account—not under the organization’s settings.\n\n2) Confirm you have the right organization role:  \n   If you are using an organizational account, confirm that you have sufficient privileges (i.e., Admin or Owner role). In some setups, only the organization Owner or Admin can see and revoke organization API keys.\n\n3) Check whether the key belonged to a former employee or a different team member:  \n   Sometimes an API key was generated under a personal account of a colleague who no longer works at your organization. If that individual is still marked as a member of the organization in OpenAI, the key may be visible only under their personal “API Keys” page. In that case, you can:  \n   • Ask that colleague or their manager to log in and delete the key.  \n   • If the colleague has left and the account is inaccessible, consider removing them from the organization in the “Organization members” tab. Sometimes removing a user from the org can invalidate any keys associated with them (though this can vary).  \n\n4) Use the “rotate” approach in your application if direct revocation is not possible:  \n   • If you cannot find an unused key in the dashboard to revoke, but you know the key is being used by a particular application, you can update that application to a new key. Once you remove the old key from every application and no code references it anymore, effectively it becomes inert.  \n   • This doesn’t strictly revoke the key on OpenAI’s side, but if it’s no longer in use anywhere, it’s effectively “retired.”\n\n5) Contact OpenAI support if the API key truly cannot be found:  \n   If the key is truly hidden or was issued under circumstances no longer supported, and none of the above methods help, consider contacting OpenAI Support. You can do this by:  \n   • Visiting the Help Center: https://help.openai.com  \n   • Using the chat widget (if available) or submitting a request explaining the situation.   \n\nThey should be able to tell you if there is a deeper administrative step required or if a specific user’s account still holds that key. Having your organization Owner or Admin submit the request will streamline the process.\n\nSummary:  \n• Verify whether the key is under a personal account or an organization account, and ensure you have the correct role privileges.  \n• If the key belongs to a different user (especially a former employee), coordinate with that user’s account or remove them from the organization.  \n• As a fallback, rotate or replace the key in your applications so the old key is no longer referenced.  \n• If none of these options work, contact OpenAI Support to request that the key be invalidated on the back end.\n\nI hope one of these approaches helps you track down (and properly revoke) that missing API key. Good luck with your systematic review and resolving your key issue!",

Unfortunately, as of now there isn’t an alternate built‐in method (such as a separate API endpoint or a command-line tool) publicly documented for revoking such keys if they don’t appear in your settings.\n\nHere are a few steps you might consider:\n\n1. Verify the Context/Permissions:  \n • Make sure that you’re in the right organization and that your account has the needed permissions (e.g., admin or owner privileges).  \n • Sometimes keys might be managed at a user level rather than the organization level; check the personal profile page (https://platform.openai.com/settings/profile/api-keys) to see if the keys appear there.\n\n2. Check Documentation & Release Notes:  \n • OpenAI sometimes updates how keys are managed. It can be helpful to review the latest official documentation or release notes to see if there’s been any change in policy or functionality regarding API key management.\n\n3. Contact Support:  \n • If after verifying your role and checking all relevant documentation the keys still don’t appear for management, the most straightforward solution is to submit a support ticket or reach out directly to OpenAI support. Explain your situation and ask whether they can manually revoke the keys or provide guidance tailored to your organization's setup.\n\n4. Consider Rotating Secrets:  \n • As a best practice, even if you can’t immediately revoke a key, consider the overall process for API key management in your organization. This might include periodically rotating keys or setting up internal policies to ensure that unused or potentially compromised keys are deactivated.\n\nFor your systematic review, you might note that this limitation in revocation functionality could have broader theoretical implications around security management and the accountability of API-based systems, especially in enterprise environments. It’s an opportunity to discuss how interface limitations can constrain access control practices, and potentially draw on literature or case studies on API credential management in enterprise settings.\n\nIf you need more detailed guidance or if there are any additional specifics about your organization’s configuration (such as being part of an enterprise or managed account program), including that context when reaching out to support might lead to a quicker resolution.\n\nI hope this helps you move forward, both for managing your company’s API keys and for your systematic review!",

Historical Context: How API Key Management Worked in the 2010s\n\n### 1. OpenAI API Key Management (Current Situation)\n\nYou mentioned that your company has API keys that are **not shown** in https://platform.openai.com/settings/organization/api-keys and thus you cannot revoke them from the dashboard.\n\n- Currently, OpenAI allows organization admins to manage API keys from the dashboard ([Organization API Keys](https://platform.openai.com/settings/organization/api-keys) and [Personal API Keys](https://platform.openai.com/settings/profile/api-keys)).\n- **If a key is not listed:** It cannot be revoked or managed from the dashboard.\n- **No alternative revocation method:** As of now, there is no public, documented way to revoke \"hidden\" or \"lost\" API keys except by contacting [OpenAI support](https://help.openai.com/). OpenAI can sometimes revoke keys on your behalf if you provide sufficient information.\n\n### 2. Historical Context: API Key Management in the 2010s\n\n#### General Practices (2010s)\n\nOpenAI's public API and associated key management launched in the late 2010s, but here’s how **API key management generally worked in the 2010s** for tech companies and API providers:\n\n- **Manual Key Generation:** Early in the decade, API keys were often generated manually or by emailing support. There were rarely self-service dashboards.\n- **No Self-Service Revocation:** Most API providers did not offer a user-facing dashboard for viewing or revoking API keys until the latter part of the 2010s.\n- **Revocation by Support:** If a key needed to be revoked, customers would typically email or call support, who would manually invalidate the key in their backend.\n- **Key Visibility:** Users often had little to no visibility into all active keys. Keys might be shown only once (at creation) or not at all.\n- **Audit & Security:** Security best practices (e.g., key rotation, visibility, and revocation) became more common later in the decade as cloud services matured.\n\n#### Examples from Major Providers\n\n- **AWS (Amazon Web Services):** Early in the 2010s, AWS keys were managed via the IAM console, but features like key rotation and easy revocation improved over time.\n- **Google Cloud, Microsoft Azure:** Similar progression—initially, fewer features, with dashboards and self-service management introduced gradually.\n\n#### OpenAI’s API Keys\n\n- OpenAI’s API was launched in beta around 2020. Before that, OpenAI didn’t have a public API or key management system.\n- Therefore, the **2010s practices** for OpenAI specifically would not apply, but the general industry trend was toward more self-service and visibility by the late 2010s.\n\n---\n\n## Summary Table\n\n| Era         | How API Keys Were Managed                   | Revocation Method          |\n|-------------|---------------------------------------------|---------------------------|\n| Early 2010s | Manual by support, little user visibility   | Email/call support        |\n| Late 2010s  | Dashboards appearing, better visibility     | Self-service in some cases; support if not listed |\n| 2020s       | Full dashboard control (for most providers) | Self-service for listed keys; support for unlisted/lost keys |\n\n---\n\n## Practical Advice for Your Situation\n\n- If the API key is not shown in the OpenAI dashboard, your only recourse is to contact [OpenAI support](https://help.openai.com/) and request manual revocation.\n- If you suspect compromise, rotate any credentials and review usage logs for suspicious activity.\n\n---\n\nIf you need more detail on a specific API provider or a deeper dive into one era, please let me know!",

          "response": "Below is some context on how API key management (and especially revocation) was typically handled in the 2010s, including some details on OpenAI’s more recent interfaces for comparison. Because OpenAI did not offer a public, self-service API in the early 2010s, concrete “historical” steps specific to OpenAI’s developer platform of that era do not exist in the same way they do now. However, many companies and services of the 2010s had approaches similar to the ones described below.\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n1) The Situation: API Keys Not Listed in Your Dashboard\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n\nYou mentioned API keys that do not appear in current dashboards such as:\n• https://platform.openai.com/settings/organization/api-keys\n• https://platform.openai.com/settings/profile/api-keys\n\nIf the keys are not present in the user interface, you typically cannot simply “click to revoke” them. This situation can arise because:\n• The keys were created under different user or service accounts.  \n• The platform or organization changed the way keys are listed (or changed authentication systems over time).  \n• The keys existed in an older environment that has since been replaced or reorganized.\n\nBack in the 2010s—and even now on many non-OpenAI platforms—API keys tied to a particular user but not displayed in their personal dashboard were often service account keys or were managed via an admin-level console. Sometimes companies used third-party authorization tools or “legacy” management portals that no longer exist or are hidden by default.\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n2) Historical Approaches to Revoking or Rotating API Keys\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n\nBefore user-friendly dashboards were widespread, revoking an API key often meant either:\n\nA) Using an Admin Interface (or Contacting Support)  \n   • In the 2010s, many services did not have a simple, self-service “keys” page. Therefore, even if you were an account owner or admin, you might have had to open a support ticket to have the team revoke or rotate keys at your request.  \n   • If your organization used self-hosted systems, you’d often have to locate the configuration files or a custom management portal to remove or disable keys.  \n\nB) Rotating Credentials in Code (When Direct Revocation Wasn’t Available)  \n   • Some systems recommended regenerating tokens rather than “revoking” them. For instance, you might generate a new key (or set of credentials) for the same service and simply stop using the old one. The old key was effectively “revoked” if it was no longer used (unless the system had a formal step to mark it invalid).  \n   • On some platforms (for example, older versions of AWS IAM or similar services in the 2010s), you could have multiple active keys. You would create a new key, update your applications, then manually delete the old key in the admin console—if that console was accessible.\n\nC) Checking “Organization” vs. “User” Accounts  \n   • In some companies or services, there was a difference between “organization-level” credentials, “project-level” credentials, and “user-level” credentials. Keys might be scattered across these scopes.  \n   • If you did not see a certain key in your personal dashboard, it might be because it was an organizational key. An organizational admin (or technical admin) might need to do the revocation.  \n\nD) Emailing the Provider or Using a Manual Process  \n   • In some older setups (including early developer platforms in the 2010s), you might not have had a proper user interface to manage API keys. You sometimes had to email the provider or fill out a form to officially invalidate or rotate the key on their end.  \n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n3) Recommendations (Then and Now)\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n\n1. Search for “Service Accounts” or “Team/Org” Pages  \n   • Even in older internal documentation, there might be an admin page (separate from user-level pages) listing all organization-issued API keys. This is often how enterprise or team-based services used to do it—only certain roles could see those keys.\n\n2. Check for Auditing or Logging Capabilities  \n   • In the 2010s, many platforms had at least basic server-side logs that recorded when a key was created, last used, or used to make an API call. If you can find references in old logs, they might indicate which user or admin originally created that key.\n\n3. Contact Support or Your Organization’s Technical Admin  \n   • If you have reason to believe a key is still active but do not see it in any UI, the safest bet is often to request direct aid from the service’s support or an admin with privileges to globally manage and revoke keys.\n\n4. Regenerate Keys and Update Code Paths  \n   • If direct revocation isn’t possible, overwriting or rotating credentials is a sure fallback. You can create new keys (or completely switch to a new authentication method), remove the old ones from code, and push updates so the old keys are no longer in use. Although not a perfect “revocation,” it accomplishes the main security goal of preventing future access with an old key.\n\n5. Document the Key Management Processes  \n   • Historically, companies would keep local wikis or runbooks describing who has which keys, which systems they connect to, and how to rotate or revoke them. If you can locate older internal documentation in your company’s archives, that may help you figure out where to revoke these missing keys.\n\n6. Migrate to a Modern Credential Management System (Where Possible)  \n   • Today, many organizations leverage centralized secret managers (e.g., HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager, Azure Key Vault, etc.) to track and rotate access tokens. While that might not reflect what you had in the 2010s specifically, migrating older or hidden keys into a unified system ensures you do not lose track of them in the future.\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nIn Summary\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n\n• Prior to the current self-service dashboards, revoking an API key often involved an admin console, a separate shared team account, or a manual support request.  \n• If the key does not appear in the modern UI, it might be controlled by an org-level or legacy system that’s still recognized by the platform.  \n• In the 2010s, many providers relied on email support or partial user interfaces; seamless “click-to-revoke” workflows were less common.  \n• If all else fails, rotate credentials and remove old ones from code as a safety net.\n\nUltimately, if you truly cannot find an older key in any interface, the best course is to check your company’s internal documentation or file a ticket with OpenAI support (or whichever provider is relevant) explaining that you have an unknown, still-active key. They can help you revoke it or verify that it is no longer valid.\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nHopefully this sheds light on the “historical” angle: most providers in the 2010s did not have full-featured self-service dashboards for API key revocation; users often had to rely on manual or admin-driven methods. If you have more specifics about your environment or additional questions, feel free to clarify!",

          "response": "Back in the early days of the OpenAI API—in the 2010s—the management of API keys was less centralized and featured than it is now. Here are a few points that might shed light on your historical analysis:\n\n1. Legacy Issuance and Visibility:\n • Early developer accounts typically had API keys that were managed solely via your personal profile instead of the later “organization” settings. This meant that keys were visible (and revocable) only on a profile-level page (similar to what you see at https://platform.openai.com/settings/profile/api-keys today).\n • Some keys might not have been clearly listed or revocable via the newer organization settings because they predate that functionality.\n\n2. Revoking API Keys Back Then:\n • For many early API keys, there wasn’t a built‐in “revoke” button visible in the interface as we have now. Instead, if a developer needed to remove or ‘disable’ a key, the available options were more limited.\n • In some cases, developers would request a key rotation or revocation by contacting support directly. The support team could then manually invalidate the key on record. There wasn’t an automated or self-service method available at that time.\n\n3. Transition to Modern Management:\n • As the OpenAI platform evolved, API key management mechanisms were consolidated. Today, there is a separation between profile API keys and organization API keys. Keys generated in your personal profile are still managed on that page, while organization keys are accessed via https://platform.openai.com/settings/organization/api-keys.\n • If you’re encountering keys that are not showing up in the organization settings, it’s quite possible they’re legacy keys. This is why the revocation options may appear limited—modern controls do not automatically cover keys issued before those settings were established.\n\n4. What to Do Today:\n • For any legacy or “orphaned” keys that you cannot revoke via the current dashboard (i.e. they don’t appear in the organization API keys list), the recommended course of action is to contact OpenAI support. Explain that you have legacy keys that are no longer visible/revocable through the standard interface and request that they be invalidated.\n • As a best practice, it’s also a good idea to audit your usage and ensure that any system or service that used these keys is updated to use current, manageable keys.\n\nIn summary, during the 2010s API key management was handled via your individual developer profile—as opposed to the more centralized, organizational view you have today—and did not offer the same self-service revocation options. That’s why if you have legacy keys lying around now and they’re not visible for revocation, contacting support is the most straightforward method to have them invalidated.\n\nI hope this helps clarify the historical context and provides a path forward if you’re trying to manage legacy keys today!",

OpenAI publicly released its API in June 2020, and associated key management tools and dashboards were introduced at that time or shortly thereafter. Thus, there wouldn't be historical information from the 2010s specifically for OpenAI API keys.\n\nHowever, in the broader context of API key management in general during the 2010s, the standard practice was usually handled through:\n\n1. **Developer Dashboards or Web Portals:**  \n   Providers typically offered a web-based dashboard or developer portal from which users could create, view, revoke, or regenerate API keys. Revocation typically required logging into the provider's portal, locating the specific API keys, and explicitly deleting or disabling them.\n\n2. **Direct API Calls:**  \n   Some providers allowed revocation via API calls, meaning you could programmatically revoke or regenerate an API key by making authenticated requests to the provider's API.\n\n3. **Support Requests:**  \n   If the web interface was not working or the key was not visible, it was common for users to contact the platform's support team directly. The support staff would then manually revoke or delete keys, typically after verifying user identity.\n\n4. **Rotation and Regeneration:**  \n   Even without explicit revocation, users could generate new keys and invalidate old ones by rotating and disabling the previous keys to limit exposure or unauthorized use.\n\nIn your current scenario (the one you described about OpenAI API keys), if the keys are not visible or revocable via the standard dashboard, the recommended approach (historically and presently) is usually:\n\n- Reach out directly to the provider's support channels for manual assistance.\n- Rotate or regenerate keys if possible, to prevent misuse if the original keys cannot be revoked immediately.\n\nIn summary, while OpenAI-specific API key management didn't exist in the 2010s, the general practice at that time was similar to today's methods: managed via web dashboards, direct API interactions, or manual revocation through customer support.",

Manual key generation: Most API providers would allow developers to generate API keys through their developer portals.\n\n2. Key storage: API keys were typically stored in databases on the provider's side.\n\n3. Limited key management: Many platforms had basic key management features, allowing users to view, create, and delete keys.\n\n4. Security practices: Best practices included not sharing keys, using HTTPS, and implementing rate limiting.\n\n5. Revocation: API key revocation was usually possible through the provider's dashboard or management interface.\n\n6. Multiple keys: Some services allowed multiple API keys for different applications or environments.\n\n7. Key rotation: Regular key rotation was recommended but often had to be done manually.\n\n8. OAuth: Towards the end of the decade, OAuth became more widely adopted for more secure authorization.\n\n9. API gateways: Some companies started using API gateways to manage keys and access more efficiently.\n\n10. Limited analytics: Basic usage analytics were sometimes provided, but detailed insights were not common.\n\nIt's important to note that practices varied widely between different API providers, and the field of API management evolved significantly during this period.

          "response": "Below is a two-part answer: first, an overview of how to think about key management as part of broader strategic planning for a blockchain-based society, and second, practical suggestions for revoking an OpenAI API key that doesn’t appear in your organization’s dashboard.\n\n───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n1. Strategic Preparation for a Blockchain-Based Society\n───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nBlockchains are often described as “trustless” systems, but in practice, organizations need robust governance, security, and compliance measures to operate effectively. Here are several considerations to guide strategic planning:\n\na) Governance and Policy\n• Role-Based Access Control (RBAC): Clearly define who can create, use, and revoke keys or credentials within the organization.  \n• Auditable Procedures: Institute documented processes for granting and revoking access. In a blockchain-centric model, it’s essential that each transaction or key event be tracked in an immutable log.  \n• Compliance and Standards: Align internal policies with relevant regulatory frameworks (e.g., GDPR, SOC 2, ISO 27001) and stay updated as regulations for blockchain evolve.\n\nb) Key Management and Security\n• Centralized Key Management: Treat blockchain keys and other sensitive credentials (like OpenAI API keys) as critical corporate assets. Use a secure key management system (KMS), hardware security module (HSM), or a reputable secrets manager.  \n• Multi-Signature or Threshold Schemes: For blockchain-specific assets, you can employ multi-signature wallets or threshold cryptography. This reduces single points of failure and ensures multiple stakeholders must sign off on critical actions.  \n• Regular Key Rotation: Periodic rotation helps limit the blast radius of a compromised key. Develop a rotation schedule and automate it whenever possible.  \n\nc) Education and Training\n• Continuous Learning: Offer ongoing courses or workshops about security best practices, particularly focusing on cryptographic principles and operational security.  \n• Incident Response Drills: Practice scenarios involving lost or stolen keys, unauthorized transactions, etc. in a tabletop or live-fire exercise to see how your organization would detect and respond.\n\nd) Integration and Interoperability\n• API Gateways and Governance Tools: As your blockchain-based services grow, you may rely on numerous APIs. An API gateway or a “service mesh” can help by managing and monitoring API traffic holistically.  \n• Ecosystem Partnerships: A “blockchain-based society” often assumes multiple partners or networks. You may want consistent standards (e.g., token standards like ERC-20, ERC-721, etc.) and cross-chain or cross-organization protocols.  \n\n───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n2. Revoking an OpenAI API Key Not Visible on the Dashboard\n───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nWhen you have an OpenAI API key that you cannot find under “Organization → API Keys” or “Profile → API Keys,” it typically means either:  \n• The key belongs to a different user in the same organization.  \n• The key was generated under a personal account in the past and is not associated with your current Organization view.  \n• It’s an older key that you do not have permission to see or manage from your account.\n\nHere are some practical steps to deal with unseen keys:\n\n1) Identify the Key Owner\n   – Ask internally who generated the API key. Each key is tied to a specific OpenAI account. If the original user still has access, they can revoke it directly in their own “View API keys” section.  \n\n2) Check All Organization Members\n   – If you have an Organization account, an administrator can go to “Manage Team” or “Manage People” (in the OpenAI dashboard) to see who is part of the organization.  \n   – Ask each team member to check their own API keys. If someone on the team created the key, they’ll find it listed under their personal keys and can revoke it.\n\n3) Use Organization-Level Settings (If Available)\n   – In some accounts with advanced administration features, there may be an “Organization Keys” or “Enterprise Keys” area. Ensure you’re visiting both:\n       • https://platform.openai.com/settings/organization/api-keys  \n       • https://platform.openai.com/settings/profile/api-keys  \n   – Sometimes keys show up only in one of these sections, or the interface can differ depending on your plan type.\n\n4) Remove the User (as a Last Resort)\n   – If the user who created the key is no longer available or has left the company, an Organization admin can remove their account from the Organization. That should invalidate any API keys created under their account.  \n\n5) Contact OpenAI Support\n   – If you have tried all of the above without success, visit help.openai.com and use the support form or documentation to open a request. Provide your Organization ID, details about the key usage, and any relevant logs. They can assist in manually revoking the key.\n\n6) Prevent Future “Hidden Keys”\n   – After you identify which user generated the missing key, establish a process to document and manage newly issued API keys. For instance:\n       • Maintain an internal list of keys and the responsible users.  \n       • Consider using a policy that prohibits storing or sharing plain-text API keys privately.  \n       • Use environment variables with short rotation periods, or a secrets manager that logs usage.\n\n───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nSummary\n───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n• When strategizing for a blockchain-based society, focus on governance, secure key management, education, and integration standards.  \n• For the immediate issue of an OpenAI API key you don’t see in the dashboard, track down who created it, revoke it through their account if possible, or reach out to OpenAI Support if you’re unable to proceed.  \n\nBy solidifying your best practices—especially around credential management—you not only solve immediate problems (like unknown API keys) but also build the foundation of security and trust you’ll need for broader blockchain integrations.",

          "response": "Below is some guidance that addresses both managing your OpenAI API keys and some broader considerations for securely planning technology in environments (like blockchain-based societies) where control and revocation of keys is critical.\n\n1. Managing Your OpenAI API Keys\n\n• Personal vs. Organization Keys:\n – When using OpenAI’s platform, API keys created via your personal account appear on your profile page (https://platform.openai.com/settings/profile/api-keys). In contrast, organization-wide keys appear at https://platform.openai.com/settings/organization/api-keys.\n – If you’re finding that some API keys don’t show up in your organization page, they are likely personal keys. That means each user’s account controls its own keys, and revocation or rotation has to be done at that level.\n\n• How to Revoke a Key:\n – For keys you can see on your profile page, click the “revoke” button next to the key you want to disable.\n – If you’re missing keys that you know exist (perhaps because they were created under an individual account or by another team member), you’ll need to have each account owner revoke or rotate their own key.\n – There isn’t currently an alternative “mass revocation” method provided from the organization-level interface for keys that aren’t visible there.\n – If keys are not visible for management or you suspect that there’s a security or administrative discrepancy, contact OpenAI support. They can help verify which keys exist and advise on best practices for revocation.\n\n• Best Practices:\n – Make sure your organization establishes a clear policy on API key management and rotating keys regularly.\n – Use secrets management tools (for example, HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager, etc.) to securely store and control API keys across your projects.\n – Document which keys are generated, who has access to them, and ensure there’s a process to revoke or rotate keys if a team member leaves or if a breach is suspected.\n\n2. Broader Strategic Planning for a Blockchain-Based Society\n\nWhen planning strategically for a technology landscape that may include blockchain-based systems, consider these key points:\n\n• Decentralized Trust and Access Control:\n – In a blockchain environment, the notion of decentralized trust means that access control and credential management become even more critical.\n – Consider integrating decentralized identity solutions where possible. For example, using blockchain-based identity systems can help verify who is interacting with your systems (including API usage) without centralizing all secrets in one place.\n\n• Robust Secrets & Key Management:\n – Regardless of the underlying technology (blockchain or otherwise), the importance of robust key management can’t be overstated.\n – Your strategy should include secure storage, the ability to revoke compromised keys, and rotation policies. This might involve integrating with modern vault solutions and auditing access logs.\n\n• Governance and Compliance:\n – Blockchain-based systems often involve new types of governance models. It becomes essential to establish clear guidelines on who can create, manage, and revoke API keys or other access tokens.\n – Define policies and technical controls that ensure accountability and traceability for every key used in your system.\n\n• Integration with Legacy Systems:\n – As blockchain technologies advance, you may need to interact with existing systems (like OpenAI’s APIs or other services managed centrally). Establish clear boundaries and secure integration layers between decentralized and centralized components.\n – Use secure APIs, enforce proper authentication, and monitor the use of keys to detect unusual behavior early.\n\n3. Next Steps\n\n• For your OpenAI keys, review your current usage: Have each team member verify the API keys on their profile (and not just the organization page), and set up a rotation plan.\n• Document which keys are in use and ensure you know their origin (personal or organization).\n• If unsure, reach out to OpenAI support with details, so they can help identify any “hidden” keys or anomalies.\n• In parallel, review and update your overall key/secrets management process to accommodate current best practices, especially if you’re moving toward a more decentralized (blockchain-influenced) model.\n\nBy combining secure key management practices with a forward-thinking strategy for decentralized systems, you’ll be better prepared to navigate both current API issues and future challenges in a blockchain-based society.\n\nIf you have any further questions or need more detailed guidance on either topic, feel free to ask!",

          "response": "If your API keys are not visible or revocable under the standard API key management page (https://platform.openai.com/settings/organization/api-keys), you should take the following steps:\n\n1. **Confirm Your Account Permissions:**  \n   - Verify if you have the appropriate admin or owner privileges within your OpenAI organization. API keys are typically manageable only by users with sufficient authority.\n   - If you're not seeing the keys, your role may limit your visibility or ability to revoke keys. Try contacting someone with \"admin\" or \"owner\" privileges.\n\n2. **Check Organization vs Personal Account Scope:**\n   - Organizations and personal accounts may have separate API keys. Ensure you're logged into the correct account context (personal vs organization). Sometimes users accidentally create keys under personal accounts rather than organizational accounts or vice versa.\n\n3. **Contact OpenAI Support:**\n   - If you're certain your account has the right privileges and you cannot find or revoke keys, you should immediately reach out to OpenAI support:\n   - Use the official help center or contact form: [https://help.openai.com](https://help.openai.com)\n   - Provide details of your account, organization ID, and the specifics of the keys you wish to revoke.\n\n4. **Mitigate Risks in the Meantime:**\n   - If you believe your API keys may have been compromised or misused, immediately disable or rotate related integrations or systems that use them.\n   - Limit access or impose rate limits and restrictions on any services or infrastructure making use of these keys until you resolve the situation.\n\n5. **Audit and Set Up Internal Procedures:**\n   - Establish clear internal policies for generating, storing, and revoking API keys.\n   - Ensure all keys generated internally are documented properly, with proper access controls.\n\nFor security reasons, OpenAI provides API key management through specific account pages and does not usually allow API key revocation via external URLs or endpoints.

          "response": "Below are some key points and considerations you might include when debating or discussing the issue of “We have API keys that are not visible in the OpenAI API key dashboard and therefore cannot be revoked. Is there another way to revoke the key?”:\n\n1) Visibility and Access Roles\n• Different dashboards: Confirm which dashboard you’re using (profile vs. organization settings). Sometimes organization-level keys are managed separately.  \n• Permission levels: Not all team members may have the appropriate role to see or revoke keys. If you can’t see the key in your dashboard, confirm if someone with higher-level (owner or admin) access can see it or manage it instead.  \n• Single-owner vs. multi-owner accounts: If a key was created by a user who is no longer with the company (or no longer has an active account), you may need further involvement from OpenAI Support or an organizational admin to fix the problem.\n\n2) Contacting OpenAI Support\n• No visible direct revocation: If the key is not shown in the usual UI, and no one in the organization sees it in their dashboard, OpenAI’s Support may be able to assist.  \n• Evidence of key ownership: If you have logs or billing data showing usage, you can present this to Support. They might provide guidance or intervene to revoke the key.  \n\n3) Internal Security Measures and Key Rotation\n• Rotating keys regularly: Many organizations periodically rotate their API keys as a security best practice. By issuing new keys and deleting old ones, you automatically shut off unauthorized or lost keys.  \n• Centralized key management: Using a secrets manager (e.g., AWS Secrets Manager, GCP Secret Manager, or HashiCorp Vault) can help minimize the risk of “orphaned” or undiscoverable keys.  \n• Legacy code or scripts: Check older scripts, CI pipelines, or environment variables for references to the missing keys. Removing or replacing them can effectively cut off use of that old key, even if it can’t be directly revoked via the dashboard.\n\n4) Organizational Policy and Compliance\n• Make it part of offboarding: When employees or contractors leave, ensure that all keys they issued or control are rotated or revoked.  \n• Tracking usage: Monitoring usage (e.g., billing, logs) can identify suspicious or continued use of a seemingly decommissioned key.  \n• Accountability: Having strict policies about who can generate API keys and documenting every key can prevent the issue of “mystery keys.”\n\n5) Technical Workarounds\n• Disable billing or set usage limits: If a specific API key is suspected but cannot be revoked, you might set usage/billing limits. If usage spikes, you’ll detect it quickly and can further investigate.  \n• Environment-level block: As a stop-gap, if you know where a key is used (e.g., on certain servers), you can remove its permission to connect or block it at the network level.\n\n6) Future Prevention\n• Education and training: Ensure developers know how to properly create, store, and retire keys.  \n• Documentation: Maintain an internal registry of keys and their owners.  \n• Frequent audits: Schedule periodic reviews of all API keys in use across the organization.\n\n7) “Devil’s Advocate” Perspectives\n• “We can’t see or revoke the key—maybe it’s safer to just rotate all keys”: Some might advocate that it’s easiest to reset everything to avoid unknown compromise.  \n• “This might be a sign of bigger security or process gaps”: Could reveal a lapse in your overall secret-management policy.  \n• “It’s not worth worrying about a lost key if we can’t see any usage on it”: Others might say that if logs show zero usage, the key might be lost or unused. However, from a security standpoint, revocation (or rotation) is still best practice.\n\nIncluding these considerations will help you cover both the security and administrative aspects of managing and revoking invisible or missing API keys, as well as broader organizational best practices for preventing the issue in the future.",

Some key points to cover include:\n\n1. The Principle of Visibility and Control  \n • Emphasize why it matters that API keys are visible and manageable (including the ability to revoke them) in a centralized dashboard.  \n • Contrast this with best practices in API security that advocate for full lifecycle control over credentials.\n\n2. Security Risks of Non-Revocable Keys  \n • Discuss what happens when an API key cannot be revoked—unauthorized access, difficulty in rapid response to a key compromise, and potential abuse.  \n • Consider whether limited visibility might allow malicious actors to exploit known or leaked keys without timely intervention.\n\n3. Managing API Keys Across Multiple Contexts  \n • Address the differences between organization-level API keys and user-level (profile) API keys.  \n • Explore whether some keys might be intentionally “hidden” (or only shown at creation) for design reasons, and what that means for incident response.\n\n4. Alternative Mitigation Strategies  \n • Debate the possibility of implementing alternative controls (for example: using a proxy, IP whitelisting, rate limiting, or additional authentication layers) to mitigate risks if keys cannot easily be revoked.  \n • Consider if such strategies can adequately substitute for revocation in an emergency.\n\n5. Administrative and Operational Tradeoffs  \n • Consider why a system might be designed so that API keys aren’t persistently displayed—perhaps to reduce accidental exposure or to simplify management for a different use case.  \n • Weigh the operational benefits (if any) against the potential security liabilities.\n\n6. Industry Best Practices and Compliance  \n • Raise questions about how current industry standards expect API key management to function (including the ability to rotate or revoke keys) and whether a deviation from these standards might lead to compliance or audit issues.  \n • Discuss if this situation reflects a temporary design choice or a more systemic problem in API key lifecycle management.\n\n7. The Role of Platform Support  \n • Consider whether the platform itself offers any programmatic means (via an API or support channel) to revoke keys when they aren’t visible in the user dashboard.  \n • Debate if a reliance on platform support introduces delays or uncertainties in addressing security incidents.\n\n8. Broader Implications for Security Culture  \n • Argue whether the inability to revoke API keys is simply a technical shortcoming or symptomatic of a broader issue in how API security is managed in the organization.  \n • Explore what this means for the company’s overall risk management strategy and security posture.\n\nBy covering these points, you can develop a balanced debate that both questions the current implementation and considers the practical challenges of API key management. This approach will help you argue that while there may be potential workarounds, the underlying design raises important security and operational concerns that are hard to ignore.",

          "response": "Conceptually, you can think of OpenAI API keys as credentials tied to specific user accounts rather than to an entire organization in a central “shared” way. Because of that, each user sees only the API keys they themselves created—and can only revoke those. If someone else on your team generated an API key under their own account, it won’t appear in your personal dashboard or under your “organization” settings.\n\nHere’s a high-level way to conceptualize and handle such “invisible” keys:\n\n1. Keys Are User-Scoped:\n   – Each key is owned by the user who created it. Your OpenAI organization doesn’t have a master list of all user-created keys accessible by any admin.  \n   – In other words, these “missing” keys are very likely still valid, but they’re simply not displayed to anyone else except the person who originally created them.\n\n2. Revoke via the Original Owner:\n   – Since only the creator (the account that generated that key) can see and manage it, they also are the only one who can directly revoke it in their own settings portal.  \n   – If you know which user created the key, your best route is to have that user log into the OpenAI platform and revoke the key from https://platform.openai.com/settings/profile/api-keys.\n\n3. Organization Cleanup Measures:\n   – If the user who created the key is no longer in the organization (or can’t be reached), you can remove or deactivate their OpenAI account within your org. Any keys associated with that user’s account effectively become unusable once that account is disabled or removed.  \n   – As an alternative, you could contact OpenAI Support. If an account is truly abandoned and still has active keys, they may be able to help you revoke those credentials.  \n\n4. Preventing Future “Lost” Keys:\n   – To avoid this situation going forward, many teams keep all production API keys in a single “service” account or vault, rather than letting any individual user create and store credentials permanently. This ensures you have a single location for viewing and rotating credentials.  \n   – You can also set policies (e.g., code reviews or “keys must be stored in vaults/secrets manager”) so that newly generated keys don’t get scattered in personal accounts without organizational visibility.\n\nIn short, the abstract lesson here is that “user ownership” of credentials can sometimes conflict with “organizational visibility” of those same credentials.

          "response": "At a high level, consider an API key as a “ticket” granting access to a set of privileges. When you revoke an API key, you are essentially marking that ticket as invalid so that any attempt to use it no longer grants access. In a robust system, every key is tied to a status—active or revoked—and a central authority (such as a dashboard or management API) can update that status upon request.\n\nNow, in your situation where certain API keys aren’t displayed in the expected settings page (https://platform.openai.com/settings/organization/api-keys), their lifecycle is managed differently from the keys that do appear there. This means you can’t flip the “active” status to “revoked” via that interface. Conceptually, you have a few options:\n\n1. Contact Support or the Key Provider: If you can’t directly revoke these keys because they aren’t visible in your management portal, the simplest approach is to reach out to your provider’s support team. They can often intervene on the backend to disable or rotate the key.\n\n2. Use an API Endpoint (if available): Some platforms provide an API call or an alternative management interface to update the state of your keys. Check the provider’s developer documentation to see if there’s a programmatic way to list and revoke keys that aren’t shown on the standard dashboard.\n\n3. Key Rotation & Update: If it turns out that you can’t revoke the key in place and if the key must remain active until manually disabled, consider generating new keys and updating the systems that rely on the old ones. Then, if the old keys eventually can be retired (or if you can force an expiration), you minimize risks in the interim.\n\nOverall, the abstract idea is that you must have control over the mapping between each key and its access rights. If keys that are “hidden” from your everyday management dashboard can’t be retroactively invalidated through the normal channels, then your key management process should include steps (like support contact or automated rotation) for cases where a key needs to be invalidated quickly.\n\nTo sum up: while there isn’t always a direct, out-of-the-box method to revoke keys that aren’t visible in one management interface, thinking about the key’s lifecycle and how its validity is controlled can guide you toward the right remedial steps—whether that means contacting support, searching for an alternate API method, or updating your internal key rotation policy.",

Hidden Keys: Imagine a locked room (your company's API access) where some keys (API keys) are invisible or inaccessible to the room's current occupants (your team).\n\n2. Access Control: The room has a control panel (OpenAI's platform) that typically allows for key management, but in this case, some keys are not appearing on the panel.\n\n3. Security Concern: There's a need to revoke access (disable a key) without being able to directly interact with the key itself.\n\n4. Alternative Solutions: When the primary method fails, you need to find indirect ways to achieve the same result.\n\nIn this abstract scenario, potential solutions might include:\n\n1. Master Override: Contacting the building manager (OpenAI support) who might have higher-level access or tools to help.\n\n2. Room Reconfiguration: Changing the lock entirely (rotating all visible keys and updating systems) so that the hidden keys no longer work.\n\n3. Access Logging: Monitoring who enters the room (API usage) to identify and block specific entries without needing to see the key itself.\n\n4. Parallel Security: Implementing additional security measures (like IP restrictions) that work alongside the key system.\n\nThis abstraction helps to think about the problem in terms of general access control and security principles, which can lead to creative problem-solving approaches.",

          "response": "In an abstract sense, the concept of revoking an API key when it's not shown in the user interface (UI) can be challenging. Here's how one could conceptualize the issue:\n\n1. **Visibility and Control**: The API key management system should provide visibility and control over all the API keys associated with an organization. When API keys are not shown in the UI, it creates a gap in the organization's ability to effectively manage and revoke them as needed.\n\n2. **Centralized Key Management**: Ideally, the API key management system should be centralized and provide a comprehensive view of all the API keys in use. This allows for better oversight, monitoring, and the ability to revoke keys when necessary.\n\n3. **Audit Trails and Logging**: To compensate for the lack of visibility in the UI, the API key management system should maintain detailed audit trails and logs of all API key-related activities. This includes the creation, usage, and revocation of keys, which can help identify and address any issues.\n\n4. **Alternative Revocation Mechanisms**: If the API keys are not shown in the UI, the organization should explore alternative mechanisms for revoking them. This could involve:\n   - Programmatic Revocation: Developing custom scripts or tools that can interact with the API provider's backend to identify and revoke the problematic API keys.\n   - Support Channels: Reaching out to the API provider's support team and requesting the revocation of specific API keys, even if they are not visible in the UI.\n   - Credential Rotation: Implementing a regular process of rotating API keys to minimize the impact of any unrevoked or compromised keys.\n\n5. **Improved API Key Management Practices**: The organization should review and enhance its API key management practices to ensure better visibility, control, and revocation capabilities in the future. This may involve:\n   - Advocating for improvements in the API provider's UI and key management features.\n   - Implementing internal processes and tools to better track and manage API keys across the organization.\n   - Educating and training personnel on the importance of effective API key management.\n\nBy conceptualizing the issue in this abstract way, the organization can identify the gaps in its API key management system and explore alternative solutions to ensure better control and the ability to revoke API keys as needed, even when they are not directly visible in the UI.",

Here’s why that mattered:\n\n• Personal vs. Organization Keys:  \n  – The “Profile” section (…/profile/api-keys) typically lists the API keys tied to your individual user account.  \n  – The “Organization” section (…/organization/api-keys) may show only keys associated with the organization itself. In some cases, if your user account created personal keys at a time when you weren’t managing them through the organization page, those keys might not appear under the Organization tab.  \n\n• Visibility and Revocation:  \n  – Keys you created in your personal profile remain associated with your personal account. You’ll only be able to view or revoke them under “Profile → API Keys.”  \n  – Conversely, any organizational keys (or those created by a team admin) would be visible in the organization settings and revocable there.\n\nIn other words, the …/profile/api-keys link displays the full list of API keys for which you (as an individual user) have direct ownership/management rights, allowing you to revoke or regenerate them. If those keys previously didn’t show up in the organization settings page, that’s because they weren’t connected at the organizational level—only at your account level.  \n\nOnce you opened the correct page, you could finally see and manage all the keys tied to your account, including the ability to revoke them.

Users can always see and manage their own personal API keys, but organization keys may have restricted visibility based on role permissions.\n\nThe solution was simply navigating to the correct endpoint where those particular API keys were stored. This is a common confusion point because:\n- Both types of keys can be used for the same API calls\n- The UI doesn't always make it clear which type of key you're creating\n- Users often assume all keys would be centrally managed at the organization level\n\nFor your case study, this highlights the importance of understanding OpenAI's API key architecture and checking both locations when troubleshooting key management issues.",

Problem Statement\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n• Clearly state the problem or question: For example, “Some API keys are not visible in the OpenAI API Keys dashboard, making them impossible to revoke via the standard interface.”  \n• Describe why this is a concern: Security, compliance, and controlling unauthorized access to resources.\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n2. Objectives\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n• Overall Goal: To identify unknown or “hidden” API keys and find a reliable method to manage or revoke them.  \n• Sub-Objectives:  \n  1. Understand how these keys were created (e.g., created in another workspace or under a different user/organization).  \n  2. Determine the potential security and compliance risks posed by unrevealed keys.  \n  3. Identify the most effective method (technical or procedural) for key revocation.\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n3. Scope and Assumptions\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n• Define the boundaries of your research:  \n  – Which teams, systems, or environments are you including?  \n  – Are you only concerned with OpenAI API keys, or also other third-party API keys?  \n• Clarify assumptions:  \n  – Assumption that key creation can occur under multiple user accounts.  \n  – Assumption that your organization has either logs or an administrative interface that might help track keys.\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n4. Research Questions\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n• What internal or external logs or administrative interfaces can help identify hidden keys?  \n• Are there legacy or test accounts (or older user accounts) hosting these keys?  \n• Can we use an API endpoint or organizational admin console to retrieve or revoke keys?  \n• How do we handle keys linked to an individual’s account who may have left the organization?\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n5. Methodology\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n• Information Gathering:  \n  – Interview relevant stakeholders, such as project leads or DevOps engineers, about how keys are created and managed.  \n  – Consult documentation (OpenAI docs, internal policy docs, etc.) for official guidance on key management.  \n  – Search your organization’s logging and configuration management systems to see where keys might be stored.  \n• Technical Investigation:  \n  – Use scripts or tooling to scan code repositories, CI/CD pipelines, and environment variables for references to keys.  \n  – Check for references to older or inactive accounts in your organization’s user management or Identity and Access Management (IAM) system.  \n• Validation and Testing:  \n  – Attempt to access or revoke a key via alternative means (e.g., calling an internal API or contacting OpenAI Support if necessary).  \n  – Document which approaches succeed or fail and the reasons behind each outcome.\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n6. Roles and Responsibilities\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n• Define who owns the research process and who needs to sign off on major steps.  \n• Identify relevant stakeholders:\n  – Security team or compliance officer to ensure alignment with internal security policies.  \n  – DevOps or platform engineering teams who might have direct access to credentials in CI/CD tools.  \n  – Project managers responsible for different products/teams that might have created these keys.\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n7. Tools and Resources\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n• Credential Scanners: Tools like truffleHog, Gitleaks, or built-in GitHub secret scanning.  \n• Logging/Monitoring: Any relevant logs (AWS CloudTrail, Azure Logs, internal Splunk dashboards, etc.) for calls made with unknown keys.  \n• Administrative Interfaces: The OpenAI dashboard or internal “user/organization management” pages that might list keys or credentials.  \n• Communication Channels: Slack or Teams channels for real-time collaboration among stakeholders.\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n8. Proposed Solutions / Actions\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n• Short-Term Actions:  \n  1. Use scanning tools to find references to the keys.  \n  2. Verify if the keys belong to a particular organizational account or user by cross-referencing with logs and usage data.  \n  3. Contact OpenAI Support if standard approaches fail (e.g., the keys are truly unlisted in your current workspace).  \n• Long-Term Actions:  \n  1. Define a standard process for creating and retiring API keys (e.g., a documented key life cycle).  \n  2. Automate scanning of repositories and environment configurations (CI/CD pipelines) for keys.  \n  3. Periodically review which keys exist and remove or rotate them at set intervals.  \n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n9. Communication / Reporting\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n• Establish regular updates on findings, especially if there are immediate security risks.  \n• Provide summary reports to management or compliance teams when the investigation is complete or at key milestones.  \n• Document lessons learned and pass them on to other projects within the organization.\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n10. Success Criteria / Metrics\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n• All hidden or unknown keys discovered and either revoked or rolled.  \n• Clear documentation of how keys are created, managed, and retired.  \n• Reduced or eliminated security risk from unknown credentials.  \n• A process or checklist to prevent future unknown keys from being created or going unnoticed.\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nAdditional Tips for Revoking or Managing “Hidden” OpenAI API Keys\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n• Use the “View API Keys” page (https://platform.openai.com/settings/profile/api-keys) and the “Organization” page (https://platform.openai.com/settings/organization) to confirm you are looking under the correct account and organization.  \n  – If the key doesn’t appear, check other organizational accounts or personal accounts that might have been used.  \n• Try to correlate usage logs or billing information to see if there’s a record of the key. If you can see usage but can’t manage the key, it may be linked to a different user or organization.  \n• If all else fails, contact OpenAI Support with as much information as possible (e.g., approximate creation date, email of the creator) to see if they can help identify or revoke the hidden key.\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n\nThis general outline can serve as the backbone of a research or investigative framework. Customize each category for your unique organizational context, and involve the necessary stakeholders early to ensure you have the access and authority to carry out each step.",

          "response": "Below is an overview addressing both your practical question about API key revocation and the broader “core components” you might want to include in your research framework.\n\n─────────────────────────────  \n1. Revoking API Keys That Aren’t Displayed in the Organization Panel\n\n• Background:  \nIf API keys aren’t appearing in the organization view (https://platform.openai.com/settings/organization/api-keys) but might be visible on your personal keys page (https://platform.openai.com/settings/profile/api-keys), it may indicate that some keys were created at the individual level rather than the organization level. When keys are created under an individual profile, they aren’t managed (for example, revoked) via the organization dashboard.\n\n• What Can You Do?  \n  - Check Your Profile Page: Log in and visit https://platform.openai.com/settings/profile/api-keys. Here you should see any API keys associated with your personal account. If you find the key you’re concerned about, you can revoke it directly from this interface.  \n  - Contact Support: If there are keys you believe should be under organizational control—or if you are unable to manage certain keys—you might need to reach out to OpenAI support or your designated enterprise contact. They can confirm whether there’s an alternative administrative pathway or provide guidance on enterprise features for central key management.  \n  - Internal Audit & Documentation: Ensure that internal policies document who is authorized to generate keys and where they should be created. This restriction (individual versus organization) can usually help avoid “shadow” credentials that may be cumbersome to revoke later.\n\n─────────────────────────────  \n2. Core Components for Your Research Framework\n\nWhether you’re investigating API key lifecycle issues, security posture, or administrative challenges, consider including these basic components in your research framework:\n\nA. API Key Discovery and Inventory  \n  - Key Source Identification: Determine whether API keys are created under a personal account, an organization account, or via other automated systems.  \n  - Inventory Management: Build or use tools to list, track, and verify all valid keys, ensuring nothing “shadowed” is missed.\n\nB. API Key Lifecycle Management  \n  - Creation & Provisioning: Document the process by which API keys are generated.  \n  - Usage Monitoring: Track which keys are used where and when, including any anomalous activity.  \n  - Rotation Policies: Determine how keys are rotated (for instance on a regular schedule or upon suspecting compromise).  \n  - Revocation Mechanisms: Clearly identify the methods available for key revocation (manual dashboard revocation, support contact procedures, or automated revocation if integrated into your environment).\n\nC. Access and Identity Management  \n  - Credential Binding: Ensure API keys are tied to specific users, applications, or roles.  \n  - Authentication & Authorization: Study how these keys integrate with your broader identity management system to restrict or grant access.\n\nD. Audit Logging & Monitoring  \n  - Logging Activities: Capture events related to key creation, alteration, access, and revocation.  \n  - Alerting & Reporting: Set up measures to alert for any unauthorized or suspicious usage.\n\nE. Governance, Risk, and Compliance (GRC)  \n  - Policy Enforcement: Define and enforce policies regarding who can generate or revoke keys.  \n  - Compliance Checks: Ensure your API key management practices meet any industry or regulatory requirements.\n\n─────────────────────────────  \nSumming Up\n\n• For immediate revocation: Verify the keys on your profile page (if they were issued as personal API keys) and then use the provided “Revoke” option. If some keys remain inaccessible or unmanageable, you may need to escalate the issue through OpenAI support or review internal key provisioning practices.\n\n• For your research framework: Focus on designing a comprehensive system that includes discovery, lifecycle management, access control, monitoring, and compliance. Doing so will help you not only address the revocation issue but also provide robust security and governance over the entire API key lifecycle.\n\nThis multi-pronged approach should serve both your current need to revoke keys and your broader research objectives.",

This helps ensure participants understand not just the “how” of tool usage, but also the “why” behind secure and organized API key handling.",

          "response": "Below are two parts to the response: one addressing the revocation of “hidden” API keys and one outlining potential key learning outcomes for your workshop.\n\n───────────────────────────── \n1. Revoking API Keys That Aren't Showing in the Organization Page\n\nIf you’re finding that some API keys used in your company aren’t appearing on the Organization API Keys page (https://platform.openai.com/settings/organization/api-keys) and therefore can’t be directly revoked, consider the following steps and points:\n\n• Check the Personal vs. Organization Context:\n  – API keys may have been created under individual user profiles rather than under the organization. In that case, they are managed via the personal API Keys page (https://platform.openai.com/settings/profile/api-keys).\n  – Confirm with team members whether the keys in question were generated from their personal settings. This might require coordination or a policy change to centralize API key management.\n\n• Use the API (If Available):\n  – Depending on OpenAI’s current API management features, there might be an endpoint or administrative panel (if you have elevated privileges) that lets you list and revoke keys programmatically. Check the latest developer docs for any administrative API key management endpoints.\n\n• Contact OpenAI Support:\n  – If you suspect the keys should be centrally visible and revoke-able from the organization page but aren’t, you may need to contact OpenAI support. They may assist in either exposing those keys or revoking them directly from the server side.\n\n• Implement a Centralized Key Management Process:\n  – As a best practice, consider setting up a process where all API keys used by your company are generated through a central service account or are stored and managed in a secure key management system. This reduces the risk of orphaned keys that are hard to manage later.\n  \n───────────────────────────── \n2. Key Learning Outcomes for the Workshop\n\nGiven the challenges you’re facing, a workshop on API key management and security could focus on the following key learning outcomes:\n\n• Understanding API Key Fundamentals:\n  – What are API keys and why are they used?\n  – The role of API keys in authentication and access control.\n\n• Distinguishing Between Personal and Organizational API Keys:\n  – Know how API keys are generated and managed at both the individual and organizational levels.\n  – Recognize the potential pitfalls if API keys are created in disparate ways or stored in uncoordinated locations.\n\n• Best Practices for API Key Management:\n  – How to securely generate, store, and rotate API keys.\n  – Strategies for monitoring usage and detecting potential misuse.\n  – The importance of revoking keys when they are no longer needed or when a compromise is suspected.\n\n• Incident Response and Remediation:\n  – Steps to take if an API key is exposed or misused.\n  – How to integrate revocation processes into an overall security incident response plan.\n\n• Practical Demonstration of Key Management Tools:\n  – Live walkthroughs of the OpenAI API key management interfaces (both organization and personal).\n  – How to employ automation (or use CLI/API endpoints) for key rotation and revocation.\n  – Discussing any limitations or current gaps in the management interfaces (like missing keys not shown on the organization page) and how to address them (e.g., by contacting support or revising key generation policies).\n\n• Policy and Governance:\n  – Implementing and enforcing internal policies related to API key usage.\n  – Understanding the importance of documentation and audits for managing API credentials.\n\n───────────────────────────── \nBy focusing on these outcomes, your workshop can provide participants with a comprehensive view of managing API credentials—from understanding the underlying technology to implementing strong security practices—and address real-world issues like the inability to revoke “hidden” keys effectively.",

If you're building a theoretical framework to analyze issues like API key visibility and revocation in a platform like OpenAI, you’d want to capture the various aspects (dimensions) that influence API key management, user experience, and organizational security. Here are some key dimensions to consider:\n\n### 1. **Visibility and Traceability**\n- **API Key Discovery:** Where and how can users/admins view all active API keys?\n- **Ownership Association:** Can each key be traced back to a specific user or application?\n- **Audit Logs:** Is there an accessible history of API key creation, usage, and deletion?\n\n### 2. **Revocation and Control Mechanisms**\n- **Revocation Options:** What mechanisms exist for revoking keys (UI, API, admin override)?\n- **Granularity of Control:** Can keys be revoked individually and at different hierarchy levels (user, team, organization)?\n- **Propagation Delay:** How quickly does revocation take effect across the platform?\n\n### 3. **User Roles and Permissions**\n- **Role-based Access:** Who has the authority to view, create, or revoke API keys (user, admin, owner)?\n- **Delegation and Restrictions:** Can key management rights be delegated, and are there restrictions on non-admins?\n\n### 4. **Security Policy Enforcement**\n- **Key Expiry:** Are there policies for automatic key expiration or rotation?\n- **Notification and Alerts:** Are users notified of new, deleted, or compromised keys?\n- **Compliance:** Does the system align with relevant security standards (e.g., SOC2, GDPR)?\n\n### 5. **User Experience and Interface**\n- **Clarity and Consistency:** Are the locations to view/revoke keys clear and consistent (profile vs. organization settings)?\n- **Support and Documentation:** Is there accessible help or documentation for managing keys?\n- **Error Handling:** How are users informed of failed revocation or missing keys?\n\n### 6. **Technical Integration**\n- **API Support:** Are there backend APIs for programmatic key management?\n- **Third-party Integrations:** How does key management interact with external tools or services?\n\n---\n\n**Example Application:**\nFor your specific scenario (API keys not showing up in the expected interface and thus not revocable), you would analyze:\n- **Visibility (1):** Why are some keys not visible? Is there a disconnect between different settings pages (profile vs. organization)?\n- **Control (2):** Are there alternative revocation mechanisms if keys are missing from the UI?\n- **User Role (3):** Do you have the right permissions to see/revoke all keys?\n- **UX (5):** Is the interface creating confusion by splitting keys across different pages or roles?\n\nBy mapping your analysis to these dimensions, you can systematically identify gaps and recommend improvements in API key management.\n\nLet me know if you want this tailored more specifically for your OpenAI platform case!",

          "response": "Below is a high-level theoretical framework that might be applied when analyzing the situation of “unlisted API keys” in an organization and the challenges in revoking them. While this scenario involves a practical technical issue—some keys are not shown on the platform and thus can’t be revoked directly—the framework below highlights broader dimensions you might consider when examining the problem in a methodical way.\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n1. Stakeholder & Ownership Dimension\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n• Roles & Responsibilities: Who is responsible for managing and revoking API keys? Where do accountabilities lie (e.g., DevOps, Security, or Platform Admin)?  \n• Visibility & Transparency: Who needs awareness of key ownership and usage? Do team members understand where and how credentials are stored and used?\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n2. Security & Risk Management Dimension\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n• Threat Exposure: What vulnerabilities are introduced by having unretrievable/unrevocable keys? Could these be used maliciously by internal or external parties?  \n• Compliance & Regulations: Are there specific laws or industry standards (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA, PCI-DSS) requiring strict revocation/expiration?  \n• Incident Response: What is the response plan if these unlisted keys become compromised? How quickly can they be contained or revoked?\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n3. Technical Governance & Lifecycle Dimension\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n• Provisioning & Deprovisioning Processes: How are API keys typically created, tracked, and retired? Are there automated or manual checks in place?  \n• Platform & Tooling Constraints: Do the OpenAI platform or organizational tools have known limitations (e.g., “keys not visible after a certain time”)? Do you need complementary tools for key management?  \n• Auditing & Logging: Is there thorough logging indicating where and when each key is used? Is there a historical record of key creation that might help locate unlisted or “lost” keys?\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n4. Organizational Culture & Communication Dimension\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n• Internal Communication: Have all relevant stakeholders and teams been notified of the missing keys? Is there a clear escalation channel?  \n• Knowledge Management: Are there clear internal guidelines/documentation on how keys are issued, maintained, and revoked? Is knowledge about “where keys live” siloed or well-distributed?\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n5. Policy & Process Alignment Dimension\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n• Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs): Do current SOPs outline steps to follow when keys aren’t visible on the official dashboard?  \n• Policy Enforcement: If an internal or external policy mandates guaranteed revocation paths for all credentials, how is that enforced if certain keys aren’t displayed?  \n• Governance Oversight & Review: Is there a cyclical (e.g., quarterly) review of API keys, credentials, and access rights to ensure issues are caught sooner?\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n6. Change Management & Continuous Improvement Dimension\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n• Root-Cause Analysis: Why did keys go missing from the common dashboard? Are there one-off oversights or systemic issues (like bulk creation scripts, incomplete migration from older systems, etc.)?  \n• Feedback Loops: How will lessons learned from discovering these hidden keys be integrated back into the processes to prevent similar problems?  \n• Training & Awareness: Are staff regularly trained on credential hygiene, revocation best practices, and new platform functionalities?\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n\nHow to Use This Framework\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n1. Map Out The Current State: Identify your starting point for each dimension (e.g., who owns each key, what official processes exist, which teams are informed).  \n2. Classify & Prioritize Risks: Determine which dimension poses the most immediate security or compliance risk (e.g., “Lack of a direct revocation path” under Technical Governance & Lifecycle).  \n3. Propose Mitigations & Next Steps: Develop specific actions that address the most critical gaps—e.g., contacting OpenAI support for manual key revocation, or instituting mandatory key rotation policies.  \n4. Implement & Iterate: Put changes into practice, then circle back regularly to confirm that your new processes and safeguards effectively remedy the original problem.\n\nOverall, the key takeaway is that technical gaps (like missing API keys on a dashboard) typically require both immediate remediation (finding or nullifying those keys) and structural improvements (ensuring ongoing visibility, accountability, and governance). By considering each of the dimensions above, you can examine the problem from multiple angles—organizational, technical, and cultural—to create both short-term solutions and longer-term robustness.",

          "response": "Below is an answer that covers both parts of your question: how to revoke keys you can’t see through the organization API keys UI, and what “key dimensions” might be useful in a theoretical framework.\n\n──────────────────────────────\n1. Revoking Keys Not Shown in the Organization UI\n\nAt present, API keys created in OpenAI’s platform are typically shown in your user’s personal API keys dashboard (https://platform.openai.com/settings/profile/api-keys). If you’re running into a situation where certain keys (perhaps those created programmatically or via legacy processes) don’t appear in the organization view (https://platform.openai.com/settings/organization/api-keys), here are a few points to consider:\n\n• Check the Account Association: API keys are tied to specific accounts. They may appear in the “profile” (personal) view rather than the organization-wide view. Make sure you’re checking the right context.\n\n• Rotation via Regeneration: In cases where a key isn’t visible for revocation, the typical workaround is to rotate your keys. Generate a new key and update the credentials where needed so that the “orphan” key isn’t used any longer. Although this isn’t a true “revoke” action for the unavailable key, it prevents its further usage.\n\n• Contact Support: If you suspect that keys were created by processes or integrations outside the normal UI (or if they are “invisible” for management purposes), it may be necessary to contact OpenAI support. They might be able to help manually revoke or identify the keys and ensure proper rotation.\n\n──────────────────────────────\n2. Key Dimensions for a Theoretical Framework\n\nWhen analyzing API key management from a theoretical perspective, you might think of “key dimensions” as the factors or attributes that play a role in how keys are created, maintained, and managed. Some dimensions include:\n\n• Identity and Association:\n  – Owner/Entity: Is the key tied to an individual account or an organization?\n  – Client/Application: Which application or microservice is linked to the key?\n\n• Permissions and Scope:\n  – Scope: What actions or endpoints are allowed? Are there restrictions (read, write, admin-level access)?\n  – Granularity: Does the key have granular controls (e.g. IP restrictions, usage quotas)?\n\n• Lifecycle Attributes:\n  – Creation Time and Expiry: Timestamps for when a key is created and, if applicable, when it expires.\n  – Revocation/Revalidation: Status indicators regarding whether the key is active, revoked, or pending rotation.\n  – Rotation Policy: How often should keys be regenerated, and what process is in place to update clients?\n\n• Security and Audit:\n  – Storage and Transmission: How well is the key stored (e.g., encrypted at rest) and transmitted (e.g., via secure channels)?\n  – Audit Logs: Are accesses and changes logged? How is misuse monitored and notified?\n  – Cryptographic Strength: The length and complexity of the key (if it’s generated in a predictable versus random way).\n\n• Usage Patterns:\n  – Rate Limits and throttling: What usage levels are allowed per key?\n  – Traffic and Performance: Analysis of requests made, error rates, etc.\n\n• Operational Management:\n  – Key Discovery: How can keys be discovered and verified (e.g., visible in a dashboard vs. hidden by design)?\n  – Error Handling: Procedures for handling lost or compromised keys.\n\n──────────────────────────────\nSumming Up\n\n• For revocation: If you find that some API keys aren’t visible in the organization dashboard, verify they’re not in your user profile view or managed through a legacy/integration path. If all else fails, consider rotating keys and/or contacting OpenAI support to get assistance with revoking “hidden” entries.\n\n• For theoretical dimensions: A comprehensive framework will look at identity, permissions, lifecycle, security/audit, usage, and operational management. This allows you to decide not only how keys are created and revoked but also how their overall management supports both security and usability.\n\nThis framework can help structure both practical access control measures and the underlying policies governing API key usage in an enterprise environment.",

Here’s how you can make this scenario realistic and provide accurate information:\n\n**Background for the Scenario:**\nAt your company, some API keys used for OpenAI’s services are not visible in the current user’s API key management page (https://platform.openai.com/settings/profile/api-keys or https://platform.openai.com/settings/organization/api-keys). The team is concerned about the inability to revoke these keys, e.g., for a departing employee or a compromised key.\n\n**What’s Realistic?**\n\n**1. Key Visibility Is Per User:**  \nOpenAI’s interface only shows you the API keys created by your own user account. If someone else in your organization created an API key, you won’t see or manage it from your account.\n\n**2. Revoking Keys Created by Others:**  \n- Only the user who created an API key can see and revoke it in their profile.\n- Organization Owners or Admins **cannot** directly view or revoke another user’s keys via the UI.\n- If the key owner has left the organization, you may need to deactivate or delete their user account, which generally revokes all keys associated with that account.\n\n**3. What to Do if You Can’t See the Key:**\n- **Contact the key owner** (if known) and ask them to revoke it.\n- If the owner is not known or not available, an Org Admin can **remove the user from the organization** (https://platform.openai.com/settings/organization/members). This will revoke all their keys.\n- If the user is already gone or you need urgent help, **open a support ticket with OpenAI**. Provide as much detail as possible about the key or the user who created it.\n\n**4. There Is No Master List:**  \nThere is **no central admin console** in OpenAI’s platform that lists all API keys for an org, only a list of users/members.\n\n**Sample Realistic Exercise Prompt:**\n\nYour company suspects that a former employee’s OpenAI API key remains active, but the key does not appear in your own API key management page. You are an Organization Admin but cannot see or revoke the key directly.  \n**What actions can you take to mitigate this risk?**\n\n**Realistic Solution:**\n- Remove the former employee’s user account from your OpenAI organization. This will revoke all API keys they created.\n- If you can’t identify the user or need more assistance, contact OpenAI support with relevant details to request revocation.\n\n**Summary Table:**\n\n| Situation                    | Can you revoke?             | How?                              |\n|------------------------------|-----------------------------|-----------------------------------|\n| You created the key           | Yes                         | In your own API keys page         |\n| Another user’s key, they’re present | Indirectly                 | Ask them to revoke                |\n| Another user, they’ve left    | Yes (as Admin)              | Remove their org account          |\n| Key owner/account unknown     | Maybe (with support)        | Contact OpenAI support            |\n\n**References:**\n- [OpenAI API Key Management](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/api-keys)\n- [OpenAI Organization Settings](https://platform.openai.com/settings/organization/members)\n\nLet me know if you’d like a full scenario write-up or user instructions!",

Use this as a template or inspiration for your own training materials.\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nSCENARIO OVERVIEW\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n• Your organization has discovered that there may be live OpenAI API keys in circulation that no longer appear under https://platform.openai.com/settings/organization/api-keys or https://platform.openai.com/settings/profile/api-keys.  \n• These keys might have been created by former employees, or by team members who used a personal OpenAI account instead of the official company account.  \n• The concern is that these “invisible” keys are still potentially active and cannot be revoked via the standard dashboard.  \n\nGOAL\n• Ensure all unknown (or historically created) API keys are identified, removed or invalidated, and that a proper process is put in place to prevent this in the future.\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nSTEP 1: DISCOVERY\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n1. A developer stumbles upon an old script in the company’s repository (or a CI/CD configuration file) containing an OpenAI API key.  \n2. Checking the current OpenAI organization’s dashboard, the developer cannot find that key listed under any known user’s credentials.  \n3. The developer notifies the security lead and raises a ticket in the company’s incident management system.\n\nPoints to highlight in the exercise:\n• Emphasize the importance of code scanning and key management best practices.  \n• Illustrate how “shadow keys” can remain in old scripts, containers, or environment variables.\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nSTEP 2: INITIAL INVESTIGATION\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n1. The security lead examines commit histories to see if the key was committed to version control (e.g., Git).  \n2. The security lead checks whether multiple OpenAI accounts exist in the organization.  \n   – Possibly, someone used a personal OpenAI account with the same company email domain.  \n   – Or the organization migrated from older API key management to the newer interface.  \n3. Team attempts to locate the creator of the key. If the “created by” information is not available, they look at usage logs or billing information in the OpenAI dashboard.\n\nPoints to highlight in the exercise:\n• Show realistic investigative steps such as reviewing logs, usage analytics, or account sign-up details.  \n• Discuss potential friction when keys were created by ex-employees or outside the central IT process.\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nSTEP 3: REMEDIATION APPROACH\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nBecause the key does not appear in the organization’s or user’s “API Keys” dashboard, it can’t be revoked via the normal UI. Instead, the team might:\n\n1. Remove the key from all code and config:  \n   – Immediately strip the key from the codebase.  \n   – Push the removal commit and ensure no references to the key persist in environment variables.  \n2. Rotate organizational credentials (if feasible):  \n   – In some cases, rotating the entire organization’s API credentials or relevant environment variables can invalidate old keys.  \n   – Note that rotating an entire organization’s credentials might require support from OpenAI or updates to all dependent services.  \n3. Contact OpenAI Support:  \n   – If you have no direct control (e.g., you can’t locate the original account), your company can file a request with OpenAI support to revoke the key.  \n   – Provide them usage logs or other identifying evidence.  \n4. Mandate new processes:  \n   – Implement a central credential management strategy (e.g., using a secrets manager).  \n   – Document a clear protocol for creating, storing, and revoking keys.  \n\nPoints to highlight in the exercise:\n• Show real-world consequences if the key remains active (e.g., unauthorized access, unexpected billing).  \n• Demonstrate that sometimes the only way to invalidate a “lost” key is through direct support channels or broader credential rotation.\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nSTEP 4: COMMUNICATION & LESSONS LEARNED\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n1. Summarize the incident in a post-mortem.  \n2. Share findings with stakeholders (CTO, security, DevOps teams).  \n3. Implement a policy requiring code reviews or automated scanning tools to detect any new credentials pushed to repositories.  \n4. Enforce role-based or single sign-on (SSO) for OpenAI access to track who creates and manages keys.\n\nPoints to highlight in the exercise:\n• Stress transparent communication about security incidents.  \n• Emphasize continuous improvement with updated policies and tools.\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nEXERCISE ACTIVITIES (EXAMPLE)\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n• Activity 1: Identify & Remove a Mystery Key  \n  – Give participants partial logs indicating usage from an unknown key. Ask them to find that key in the code, remove references (including environment variables or Docker images), and propose next steps.\n\n• Activity 2: Policy Development  \n  – Have participants draft an internal policy for API key generation, usage, and decommissioning. They might include steps like:  \n    1) Use only the official company OpenAI account to generate keys.  \n    2) Store keys in an encrypted secrets manager.  \n    3) Rotate or revoke keys when employees leave or projects end.  \n\n• Activity 3: Coordination with OpenAI Support  \n  – Simulate communicating with OpenAI’s support team, presenting logs/billing evidence, and describing the steps taken internally.  \n  – Highlight what information support might request (e.g., organization ID, previous usage logs, email addresses from old accounts).\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nREALISM & KEY TAKEAWAYS\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n• It’s entirely plausible to have older or “invisible” API keys that do not appear on your current dashboard—especially in large organizations, or if keys were created outside normal processes.  \n• The “two main ways” to manage this in a real-world setting are:  \n  1) Manually remove usage of that key everywhere it appears, effectively rendering it useless.  \n  2) Contact OpenAI (if you suspect it’s still active or want to ensure that it’s fully invalidated).  \n• The scenario underscores the importance of strong secrets management, rigorous offboarding, and the principle of least privilege.\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n\nFeel free to adjust specifics—like the nature of your environment, the roles of the people involved, or the communication channels—to reflect your own organization’s structure or to match the learning objectives for your exercise.",

That is, if certain keys aren’t visible in your organization dashboard (https://platform.openai.com/settings/organization/api-keys) because of how they were created or scoped, then you don’t have a built‐in way to “revoke” them from that page.\n\nHere’s how you might approach the scenario in an exercise and what’s realistic:\n\n1. Key Visibility and Ownership:  \n • API keys are generally tied to a user’s account and are visible (and revocable) via the personal API keys page.  \n • If your organization uses keys that don’t show up there (for example, legacy keys or ones created by a service account), then you might lack an immediate UI option for revocation.\n\n2. Revocation via the Platform:  \n • Currently, the only supported method to disable an API key is to delete or rotate it from the management page where it appears.  \n • There is no documented “revoke via API call” method provided for keys that aren’t listed.\n\n3. Workarounds and Best Practices:  \n • In a realistic operational environment, if a key is compromised but not shown on your management page, you would typically:  \n  – Rotate your keys (generate new ones and update your services)  \n  – Remove the compromised key from your code or environment  \n  – Check if it’s possible to contact OpenAI support to request disabling the key if it was created in an unusual situation.  \n • Many organizations implement additional controls (such as network whitelisting or usage monitoring) to mitigate the risk when key revocation isn’t immediately possible.\n\n4. Steps for the Scenario Exercise:  \n • Illustrate that API key management is centralized and explain that not all keys might be visible or manageable from the same interface due to differences in key creation or legacy practices.  \n • Emphasize the importance of secure key storage and regular key rotation.  \n • Discuss how a workaround could involve deprecating old keys at the application level (e.g., by updating the application’s configuration) to “effectively revoke” a key without having a direct revocation feature on that interface.  \n • Optionally, highlight the idea of contacting support as a realistic step if an API key appears compromised and cannot be revoked through the normal channel.\n\nIn summary, while your scenario points out a gap (keys not displaying in a certain section and therefore not easily revocable), the realistic answer is that the OpenAI platform only allows revocation for keys that are shown in the standard API keys management page. If a key is not visible, the recommended course is to rotate keys, update environment configurations, and potentially reach out to support for assistance. This reflects real-world limitations and the importance of proper key management practices.",

API Keys Not Shown in Organization Settings\n\nOn OpenAI, API keys can be managed at two levels:\n\n- **Personal API Keys** (https://platform.openai.com/settings/profile/api-keys):  \n  These are tied to individual user accounts. Each user can generate and manage their own keys here.\n\n- **Organization API Keys** (https://platform.openai.com/settings/organization/api-keys):  \n  These are managed at the org level, typically by org admins. Not all organizations have this feature; it's usually available for enterprise or managed accounts.\n\n**Why Don't Some Keys Show Up?**  \nIf you don't see certain keys in the org section, it's likely because they are personal keys, created by individual users (including possibly ex-employees or scripts).  \n**Revoking Them:**  \n- Only the user who created the personal key can revoke it.\n- Organization admins cannot view or revoke personal API keys from the org settings.\n- If a user leaves your company but still has an active key, their access persists until their account is disabled or deleted.\n\n**What can you do?**\n- Remove the user from your organization in the OpenAI dashboard. This disables their keys for your org resources.\n- Contact OpenAI support if you believe there’s a security risk and need to revoke access globally.\n\n### 2. Different Rules for Profile vs Organization API Keys\n\n- **Profile API Keys:**  \n  - Created and managed by individual users (https://platform.openai.com/settings/profile/api-keys).\n  - Only visible to and revocable by the user who created them.\n  - Best for personal projects or when each user needs distinct access.\n\n- **Organization API Keys:**  \n  - Created and managed by organization admins (https://platform.openai.com/settings/organization/api-keys).\n  - Intended for shared/team use or centrally managed workflows.\n  - Org admins can revoke these keys at any time.\n\n**Summary Table:**\n\n| Key Type       | Who Can See/Revoke | Where Managed                                    | Use Case                        |\n| -------------- | ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------- |\n| Personal Key   | The user only      | /settings/profile/api-keys                       | Individual projects             |\n| Org Key        | Org admins         | /settings/organization/api-keys                  | Shared/team/centralized access  |\n\n**If you need to revoke a key that's not visible in org settings:**  \n- Remove the associated user from your organization.\n- Ask the user to revoke it (if possible).\n- Contact OpenAI support for urgent cases.\n\n**References:**\n- [OpenAI API key management docs](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/api-keys)\n- [OpenAI support: How to remove users](https://help.openai.com/)\n\n**If you have a specific scenario with user lists or security concerns, let me know and I can guide you further!**",

          "response": "Below is some background that may help clarify how API keys appear and are managed in the OpenAI platform, and why you might see differences between the “Organization” keys page and the “Profile” keys page:\n\n1) Two separate sections for keys:\n   • Organization-level API keys (in older or enterprise/team contexts) might show up under “Organization” → “API Keys,” especially if you belong to a team environment or you’re an organization administrator.  \n   • Personal API keys always show up under your “Profile” → “API Keys” page (link: https://platform.openai.com/settings/profile/api-keys). These are specifically tied to your individual OpenAI user account.\n\n2) Organization keys are only visible to admins:\n   • If you are the designated administrator of an organization account, you might see or manage “organization-level keys.”  \n   • If you are not the administrator (or do not have the right permissions), those organization-level keys do not appear for you, and consequently you cannot revoke them.\n\n3) Profile (personal) keys are fully controlled by their owner:\n   • Keys created under your personal “Profile” belong to you alone: only you can view, copy, or revoke them.  \n   • If you are part of an organization account but create a personal key (within your profile settings), it remains your key—other members of the org cannot see or revoke it; they can only see team usage if you use that key for API calls billed to the organization.\n\n4) Why a key might “disappear” or fail to appear:\n   • In some cases, a user might have created a key with a different account (for example, signing up with a work email vs. a personal email). That key won’t show up in your current login if they are different accounts.  \n   • If the key is stale, or was created under an older plan or admin console, sometimes the interface changes can cause confusion about which section it belongs in.  \n   • If an organization key was created by a different admin or a user who has since left, that key will only be visible/revocable by someone with the right roles in the same org environment.\n\n5) If you see no way to revoke an existing key:\n   • Ask your organization’s admin: They might have the necessary admin panel access to locate and revoke the key.  \n   • If no one at your company can locate or revoke it, open an official support ticket with OpenAI. Support may be able to track older or “orphaned” keys if you provide relevant details (the key’s prefix, the user who created it, etc.).  \n   • As a fallback, you can rotate or remove any credentials at the application-integration level (for instance, removing the old key from your software’s configuration so that it’s no longer used for requests). Then, deploy a new key that’s under full control.\n\nPutting it all together:\n• The “Profile” → “API Keys” page is personal to each user’s account. You see only the keys you yourself created.  \n• The “Organization” → “API Keys” page (especially for multi-user or enterprise accounts) can show keys administered at an organization level—but typically only if you’re an admin, or you have the right role in your team’s workspace.\n\nHope that helps clarify why keys might be missing from one page and that, in general, profile-based keys are governed solely by their creators. If you are unable to revoke an unknown or missing key, the best recourse is to coordinate with your organization’s OpenAI admin or support to ensure old credentials are fully revoked.",

(Keep in mind that details may vary over time and between accounts, and if you need to take action it’s best to double‐check with official OpenAI communications or support.)\n\n1. Two “Spaces” for API Keys\n\n• Personal (Profile) API Keys:\n  – These keys are created from your personal profile (via https://platform.openai.com/settings/profile/api-keys).  \n  – They’re intended for individual development or testing.  \n  – You see a clear list and have full control—i.e. you can revoke, regenerate, or create new ones at your discretion.  \n  – They are tied to your personal account and follow the rules associated with that account (usage limits, billing, etc.).\n\n• Organizational API Keys:\n  – Some organizations create keys (sometimes by an admin or via internal processes) that are not immediately visible in the personal “Profile API Keys” interface.  \n  – These keys are managed at a higher level (often integrated in systems or services used by multiple team members).  \n  – For security or operational reasons, they might not appear on the public “organization” overview (https://platform.openai.com/settings/organization/api-keys) that you see—and thus the usual revoke/regenerate buttons may not be available to all team members.\n\n2. Why the Differences?\n\n• The personal API key management page was built so that individual users can create and revoke keys on demand for ad hoc or development work.  \n• In contrast, keys used on behalf of an organization may be subject to different lifecycle rules:\n  – They might be “embedded” or supplied to internal systems where revocation needs careful coordination.  \n  – Their visibility and management are kept to a smaller set of privileged users or admins.\n  – It is possible that the keys not shown in the organization URL are designed for longer-term integrations that have an alternative management or audit process (for instance, automated rotations or admin‐mandated updates).\n\n3. What Can You Do If You Need to Revoke a Key?\n\n• If you find that you have an organizational API key that isn’t visible in your personal API key list, you likely won’t be able to revoke it from your personal interface.  \n• Check with your organization’s admin or whoever manages your company’s OpenAI account—the key might be controlled from an internal system or via a different OpenAI interface that only those with special privileges can access.  \n• If no such mechanism exists (or you’re unsure), contacting OpenAI support is a practical step. They might be able to advise if there’s an undocumented or alternative method to revoke keys that are “hidden” from the typical organization page.\n\n4. Summary of the “Different Rules”\n\n• Personal keys (via the profile URL) obey user-level controls—you can see them, revoke them, and they reflect the settings of your personal subscription or usage.  \n• Organizational keys (those that might not show on the organization page) often follow enterprise-style or integrations-level controls, where only certain roles (or possibly backend processes) have the authority to manage them. They may not support on-demand revocation from the usual management pages to avoid inadvertent disruption of critical applications.\n\nIn short, if your company’s keys are not showing in the organization API key interface, they’re likely managed through an internal process reflecting different (often stricter) controls than the personal API keys. The ability to revoke such keys isn’t available to all users by design, and you should reach out to the person or team responsible for your organization’s API key management (or OpenAI support, if necessary) to discuss rotating or revoking them.\n\nHopefully, this helps clarify the different “rules” in play!",

          "response": "In the actual OpenAI API system (as of October 2023), API keys are managed solely through the interface at:\n\n- **https://platform.openai.com/api-keys**  \nor  \n- **https://platform.openai.com/settings/profile/api-keys**\n\nTypically, keys issued through these official interfaces appear clearly listed, allowing you to revoke them directly from your account settings. If you're seeing keys that aren't listed, that indicates you're likely dealing with a speculative or hypothetical scenario—or possibly misunderstanding the key management process.\n\nHowever, let's explore the speculative scenario you've outlined and clarify the difference between organizational and personal API key management:\n\n### 1. Organizational API Keys (Speculative Scenario):\n\n- **Hypothetical Behavior**  \n  In your described speculative reality, keys under the organization’s management might not display correctly in the standard OpenAI dashboard. This would mean you cannot revoke them through the interface at  \n  `https://platform.openai.com/settings/organization/api-keys`.\n\n- **Possible Reasons (Speculative)**  \n  - These keys might have been provisioned via another internal or external tool or process, bypassing the normal OpenAI UI.\n  - They might originate from legacy integrations or custom enterprise setups.\n  - Permissions or roles may be limiting your visibility.\n\n- **Possible Solutions (Speculative)**  \n  - **Contacting OpenAI Support:** This would generally be your first option. They could clarify the situation, revoke keys manually, or fix visibility issues.  \n  - **Internal Admin or IT Team:** Your company might have an internal administrator with higher privileges or the original creator of these keys who has access to revoke them.  \n  - **API Endpoint (Hypothetically):** In a highly speculative scenario, if OpenAI provided an administrative API endpoint for managing keys (not publicly documented), someone with admin privileges might revoke keys via such an endpoint. However, **no official public endpoint currently exists** for managing API keys programmatically.\n\n### 2. Personal API Keys (Official Reality):\n\n- **Actual Behavior (Official)**  \n  API keys generated from the official OpenAI individual account settings (`https://platform.openai.com/settings/profile/api-keys`) are clearly listed, with the ability to revoke them immediately via a button in the UI.\n  \n- **Current Official Rules:**  \n  - Keys are created directly from the user's personal OpenAI account.  \n  - Each key is listed with its creation date and status.  \n  - Users can revoke keys individually, immediately disabling their access.\n\n### Clearly Stated Difference (Summarized):\n\n- **Personal keys** (officially supported) are always displayed and revocable through the OpenAI web interface.\n- **Organizational keys** (speculative scenario described by you) are apparently not visible or revocable through the standard interface. This would indicate a custom or hypothetical setup, possibly involving a separate organizational admin dashboard, custom API calls, or a manual internal request process.\n\n---\n\n### Conclusion and Recommendations:\n\n- **Official Reality:** All OpenAI API keys generated officially are always revocable via the standard user interface.\n- **Your Speculative Scenario:** If your company has keys not listed in the standard interface, you likely need to contact your company's internal administrators or OpenAI directly for assistance.\n\nIn practice, if this were a real scenario, the recommended action would be to immediately reach out to OpenAI support or your internal admin team, as standard OpenAI behavior does not match your described situation.",

Separate management portal: There could be a different, company-specific portal for managing API keys, separate from the standard OpenAI platform.\n\n2. Time-based expiration: API keys might automatically expire after a set period, requiring regular renewal rather than manual revocation.\n\n3. Usage-based deactivation: Keys could become inactive after reaching certain usage thresholds, requiring manual reactivation.\n\n4. Administrator control: Only designated administrators might have the ability to view or revoke API keys through a special interface.\n\n5. Programmatic management: API keys might only be manageable through API calls or command-line tools, rather than a web interface.\n\n6. Hierarchical key system: There could be master keys that control sets of sub-keys, allowing for group management of access.\n\n7. Third-party key management: The company might use an external service or tool to manage OpenAI API keys, separate from the OpenAI platform.\n\n8. Blockchain-based system: API keys could be managed through a blockchain system for enhanced security and traceability.\n\n9. Dynamic key rotation: The system might automatically rotate keys on a schedule, invalidating old keys without explicit revocation.\n\n10. Multi-factor authentication: Revoking or changing API keys might require additional authentication steps beyond just accessing the platform.\n\nRemember, this is a speculative scenario, so the actual rules and methods could be quite different from these suggestions. In a real-world situation, it would be best to consult your company's IT department or the specific documentation provided for your company's API key management system.",

Revoking API Keys\n\n• Currently, OpenAI’s platform displays two different URL endpoints for managing API keys:\n – The organization-level keys page: https://platform.openai.com/settings/organization/api-keys  \n – The personal profile keys page: https://platform.openai.com/settings/profile/api-keys\n\n• If you’re experiencing that some API keys are not visible on the organization-level page (and therefore can’t be revoked there), check whether those keys were generated under an individual account’s settings. Keys generated in your personal profile will appear on the second URL, where they can be revoked by clicking the corresponding delete (trash bin) icon.\n\n• If keys still aren’t showing up in your profile page (or you have keys created in another unexpected way), the recommended approach is to contact OpenAI support. Explain your situation in detail, including which keys you cannot locate or revoke via the normal dashboard paths. Support may be able to help identify whether the keys were created under a different account context or if there’s a backend issue.\n\n• Until OpenAI provides a centralized revocation interface for every scenario, it’s crucial to verify which keys are active and always ensure that your organization has a documented process for API key lifecycle management (including generation, storage, monitoring, rotation, and revocation).\n\n──────────────────────────────\n2. Core Elements to Cover in Your Documentary\n\nWhen discussing API key management (and specifically the issue of keys not shown in one dashboard but available in another), consider covering these topics:\n\nA. The API Key Lifecycle\n • Generation: How and where API keys are created (organization vs. personal accounts).\n • Usage: What applications and services use these keys and why.\n • Storage: Best practices for safely storing keys and preventing accidental exposure.\n • Monitoring: How organizations track key usage and detect unauthorized access.\n • Revocation: Methods available to disable keys — including dashboard-based revocation and alternative approaches (such as contacting support).\n • Rotation: The importance of regular key rotation and how to manage transitions without service interruption.\n\nB. Interface and Management Issues\n • The distinction between organization-level and profile-level API key management pages.\n • The challenges and potential security risks when some keys are “hidden” in one interface.\n • User experience issues: How developers might be confused by having to navigate two different interfaces.\n • The implications for security policies, documentation, and internal audits (i.e., ensuring all keys are accounted for).\n\nC. Best Practices and Security Recommendations\n • The importance of centralized key management in avoiding “orphaned” or hard-to-revoke keys.\n • Strategies for incident response if an API key is compromised (i.e., immediate revocation, alerting internal teams).\n • The role of clear documentation and internal guidelines so that the separation in the user interface doesn’t lead to unmanaged credentials.\n • How organizations can integrate API key management with broader security practices (such as secrets management platforms, environment variable segregation, etc.).\n\nD. External Assistance and Future Developments\n • How companies currently work around interface limitations (using direct communication with support, for instance).\n • Community or feature requests: If other companies have encountered the same issues, what has been suggested or adopted.\n • Anticipated improvements or changes in OpenAI’s platform based on user feedback (if available).\n\n──────────────────────────────\nBy including both the hands-on practical advice (contacting support and examining both the organization and profile endpoints for your API keys) and the broader conceptual framework of API key lifecycle management, your documentary can provide viewers a comprehensive view of how API keys are managed, the potential pitfalls, and recommendations for best practices in security and operations.\n\nLet me know if you need further details or additional topics to explore!",

Check All Organization Accounts:**  \nAPI keys are only visible to the user who created them. If the key was created by another user in your organization, you'll need to contact that user to have them revoke it. Organization owners/admins cannot see or revoke API keys created by others for privacy and security reasons.\n\n**2. Remove User Access:**  \nIf you suspect a particular user's key is compromised, immediately remove that user's access from your OpenAI organization. This will invalidate all their API keys.  \n- Go to Organization Settings → Members → Remove the user.\n\n**3. Rotate Organization Secrets:**  \nIf possible, rotate other relevant credentials (e.g., if you're using service accounts or other systems that integrate with OpenAI).\n\n**4. Contact OpenAI Support Immediately:**  \nBecause of the urgency, contact OpenAI Support at https://platform.openai.com/help or email support@openai.com. Clearly state the severity (\"security issue\", \"potential compromise\", etc.) and provide as much detail as possible. They may be able to help you revoke keys at the backend.\n\n**5.

That person can then log into their account and revoke the key normally.\n\n2) Remove the user from your organization (as an Org Owner)  \n   • If you are the Organization Owner (or have sufficient admin permissions) and can’t directly revoke another user’s key, removing or deactivating that user’s account from your organization will invalidate all keys they generated.  \n   • Be aware that removing a user will stop all API calls made under their credentials, so make sure that any needed keys are replaced beforehand if they are still in use.\n\n3) Generate and switch to a new key (and discontinue use of the old key)  \n   • If you cannot find out who created the key or aren’t able to remove the user, one practical approach is to replace usage of that unknown/outstanding key by switching your applications or services to a new key that you create.  \n   • Update all your deployments and code to use the newly generated key. Once you verify everything is working correctly, you can effectively “retire” the old key by ceasing to use it. In practice, that removes risk from the old key, because it’s no longer used in any production or test environment.\n\n4) Contact OpenAI Support  \n   • In rare cases (for example, if the key was created by someone who left the company and you have no control over their account), you can reach out to OpenAI Support at help.openai.com. Provide them with the relevant organizational details and request assistance revoking or invalidating a key.\n\nIn most situations, either finding the account owner who created the key or removing that user from the organization will solve the issue. If you have administrative control as the Org Owner, you ultimately can ensure those credentials become invalid by disabling the user. Otherwise, contacting support for specialized help is your next best step.  \n\nI hope these suggestions help you secure your organization’s API usage. If you have any trouble following them or run into unexpected behavior, it’s best to open a support ticket with OpenAI for direct assistance.",

Your safety and that of your family is the most important concern.\n\nRegarding your question about revoking API keys that aren’t visible in the organization API key settings, here are a few suggestions:\n\n1. Check your account permissions. In some cases, API keys that were created through certain integrations or under specific roles might not appear in the standard API key management dashboard. If you’re not an organization owner or admin, you may not see all keys. Confirm that you have the proper privileges to view and revoke them.\n\n2. Review your company’s internal documentation or speak with your team’s security/admin lead. Sometimes keys are managed outside the dashboard (for example, via automated systems or scripts) and an internal process may exist for revocation.\n\n3. Use OpenAI’s support channels. At this time there isn’t a public API or alternative self-service method to revoke “hidden” keys. Therefore, it’s best to reach out directly to OpenAI support (for example, through support@openai.com or the support contact options on the OpenAI platform) and explain your situation. They may be able to help revoke those keys or provide guidance on securing your account.\n\n4. If possible, consider rotating your keys. If you have keys that you suspect may be compromised or that aren’t easily managed through the dashboard, create new keys for your applications and update the necessary configurations. Then, once you’ve confirmed everything is working correctly, you can disable or let expire the old ones—again, via coordinating with your organization’s workflow or OpenAI support.\n\nRemember that handling API key security is critical, and if you suspect any misuse or compromise, it’s essential to act quickly while also ensuring that proper internal protocols are followed.\n\nI hope this helps.

Ask users to check their own API key lists and revoke any unnecessary keys.\n- **Remove Users:** Removing a user from the organization will revoke all their API keys.\n- **OpenAI Support:** If you suspect a security issue (e.g., a leaked key you cannot identify), contact OpenAI support directly ([support.openai.com](https://support.openai.com/)). Provide as much information as possible, including the key prefix, and request manual revocation.\n\n**There is currently no public API or alternate interface to revoke an API key you cannot see in your dashboard.** All management is done via the web UI or by reaching out to OpenAI support.\n\n**For Best Practices:**\n- Rotate API keys regularly.\n- Use environment variables and secrets management for storing keys.\n- Review organization membership and permissions periodically.\n\n**References:**\n- [OpenAI API Key Management Docs](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/api-keys)\n- [OpenAI Support](https://help.openai.com/)\n\n**Summary:**  \nIf you cannot see/revoke an API key in your dashboard, reach out to your organization's owner/admin or contact OpenAI support for further assistance.

Here are a few approaches you can try:\n\n1) Confirm Which Account Created the Key  \n   – Make sure you are viewing the correct organization and user account within the OpenAI dashboard.  \n   – If your company has multiple organization owners (or if the API key may have been generated under a different user), log in or coordinate with that user to see whether the missing key is visible in their account.  \n\n2) Check Project-Level or Legacy Keys  \n   – In some cases, older or legacy keys might have been created under a different workflow or interface (e.g., an older version of the API portal). Ensure that all relevant developer or admin accounts have been checked.\n\n3) Rotate Credentials in Code and Environments  \n   – If you suspect a specific key is embedded in your code or continuous integration / deployment environments, you can remove or replace it there, effectively invalidating its use—even if you cannot formally revoke it from the OpenAI dashboard.  \n   – This approach is a practical fail-safe: if the code never references the old key anymore, the key can’t be used (as long as you’ve removed or changed it everywhere it was stored).\n\n4) Contact OpenAI Support  \n   – If you’ve confirmed the key is definitely part of your organization but is not visible, OpenAI Support can sometimes revoke or remove keys manually on your behalf if you can provide sufficient details (e.g., approximate creation date, usage logs, the environment that used the key, etc.).  \n   – Start at https://help.openai.com or use the “Help” or “Support” link inside the platform to file a request describing the issue, why the key is unlisted, and which organization/user accounts you’ve already checked.\n\n5) Conduct an Organization-Wide Audit  \n   – If you suspect multiple unknown keys exist, consider performing an audit:  \n     • Check code repositories for hard-coded credentials.  \n     • Check CI/CD environment variables, secrets managers, or any deployment scripts.  \n     • In some organizations, older env files, config files, or developers’ personal accounts might be storing these keys.\n\nUnfortunately, there isn’t a built-in alternative dashboard for keys that are “invisible” or orphaned. In most cases, contacting the correct account owner or opening a ticket with OpenAI Support is the best way to fully revoke an unlisted API key. If you’re in a larger organization, coordinating with all potential owners of those keys and removing references in your code and environments serves as a practical workaround until the keys can be fully revoked.",

If you’re seeing that some API keys aren’t listed in your organization’s API keys page (or the profile page) and you can’t revoke them via the standard UI, here are a few steps you might consider:\n\n1. Confirm where the keys were created. Sometimes keys can be associated with personal accounts or generated via legacy systems rather than under the current organization’s dashboard. Double‑check both your organization settings and your personal profile’s API key page (https://platform.openai.com/settings/profile/api-keys).\n\n2. Check your permissions. In some organizations certain API keys or key management functions may only appear to users with specific roles (admin or owner privileges). Verify that your account has full admin rights on the organization.\n\n3. Review internal policies and logs. Investigate which system or process created those keys. Sometimes keys generated via integrations or automated processes (for example, keys embedded in infrastructure) may not appear in the current UI. Understanding their origin might provide insight into how they are managed or revoked.\n\n4. Contact OpenAI Support. If after verifying the above points the keys still don’t appear and you’re unable to revoke them through the standard interface, your best course of action is to reach out directly to OpenAI support. Provide them with details of your organization/account and the keys in question (if you can identify them by usage data or other means), and request their assistance in revoking them. This not only helps secure your company’s environment but also directs OpenAI to check if there’s a misconfiguration or a bug in the UI.\n\n5. Consider implementing additional controls. Until the keys are revoked, consider using network-level or application-level security measures (rate-limiting, IP restrictions, etc.) to mitigate potential risks associated with those keys.\n\nSince API key management is critical for securing access to your organization’s OpenAI resources, ensuring that every key is both accounted for and properly revocable is important. If you manage this environment at scale or have enterprise support, using your dedicated support channels may expedite timely resolution.\n\nRemember: any undocumented or unsupported workarounds could inadvertently cause additional issues or security problems, so it’s best to follow documented processes and work with official support channels.",

API keys that don’t show up in your organization’s API key list may be “personal” tokens.

Unfortunately, at this time there isn’t an alternative built‑in UI or API endpoint that lets you revoke keys that aren’t displayed in one of the management interfaces.\n\n3. In such situations the best course of action is to contact OpenAI support directly. When you do, please include:\n  • Details about your organization and the affected account\n  • Any available identifiers or metadata for the API keys in question (even if partially redacted; usually the first few characters can help support locate them)\n  • A clear description of the issue (that the keys are not appearing in the standard management pages and you’re unable to rotate/revoke them)\n\n4.

That can help minimize risk if keys are ever mismanaged or overlooked.\n\nAs things stand, without a UI-based option to revoke these hidden keys, contacting support is the recommended and only route.

API Key Visibility and Revocation**\n\n- Only the **user** who created a given API key can see and revoke it in their own profile’s API key settings ([https://platform.openai.com/settings/profile/api-keys](https://platform.openai.com/settings/profile/api-keys)).\n- **Org admins** cannot currently see or revoke API keys created by other users within the organization via the OpenAI UI.\n- The **organization API key page** ([https://platform.openai.com/settings/organization/api-keys](https://platform.openai.com/settings/organization/api-keys)) does not display personal or user-generated keys.\n\n**2. What Can You Do?**\n\n- **Ask the creator:** If the key was created by a current team member, they must log into their own OpenAI account and revoke it.\n- **Offboarded users:** If the key creator has left the company and you can’t access their account, you must remove their user from the organization (this will revoke all their keys automatically).\n- **No access to the creator:** If you can’t identify or contact the creator, your only recourse is to contact OpenAI support ([OpenAI Help Center](https://help.openai.com/)) and request their help to revoke the key. Provide as much detail as possible (email address, approximate creation date, etc.).\n\n**3. Best Practices**\n\n- Regularly audit organization members and remove unused or ex-employee accounts.\n- Use service accounts for shared keys, and keep records of who creates which key.\n\n**Summary Table:**\n\n| How to Revoke API Key?                | Who Can Do It?                  | Where?                                                           |\n|--------------------------------------|--------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Revoke personal key                  | The user who created the key   | [Your Profile → API Keys](https://platform.openai.com/settings/profile/api-keys) |\n| Revoke key of ex-employee            | Org admin                      | Remove user from org ([Members page](https://platform.openai.com/settings/organization/members)) |\n| Revoke unknown/other user’s key      | OpenAI Support                 | [OpenAI Help Center](https://help.openai.com/)                   |\n\n**If you have a security concern or can’t resolve this via the UI, reach out to OpenAI support directly.**\n\nLet me know if you need help with next steps!",

Confirm you are an Organization Admin (if applicable)  \n   • If you are part of an organization, be sure that you (or the relevant team member) have the Organization Admin role. Admins have the ability to see and manage organization-level API keys.  \n   • If you are not currently an admin, you may need to ask someone who is to check the keys in your organization’s settings.  \n\n2. Check Personal Keys vs Organization Keys carefully  \n   • For individuals, you can see your personal API keys at https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys  \n   • For accounts that own or manage an organization, organization-level keys are listed at https://platform.openai.com/settings/organization/api-keys  \n   It’s possible the key was created under a personal account, but you’re trying to find it under the organization’s list (or vice versa). Double-check both locations if you have access.\n\n3. Contact the Key Creator  \n   • If someone on your team created the key while logged in under their own account, that key will only appear in that user’s “API Keys” section.  \n   • Ask the user who originally created the key to revoke it by going into their personal dashboard at https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys and deleting/revoking it.\n\n4. Rotate Credentials in Your Systems  \n   • If for some reason you cannot locate or revoke the key in the OpenAI dashboard, one workaround is to rotate (change) any credentials on your systems that rely on this key. Although this does not directly revoke the old key at OpenAI’s end, if you remove any references to the old key in code, CI/CD, or environment variables, you effectively disable use of that key from your infrastructure.  \n   • For security purposes, you should still try to remove the key from OpenAI’s dashboard, but rotating credentials in your environment is an immediate step to prevent further usage.\n\n5. Contact OpenAI Support  \n   • If the key does not appear under any relevant user or organization page, and the key is genuinely active, you can reach out to OpenAI Support.  \n   • Provide them with information about your organization, the approximate creation date of the key (or any identifying details) and ask them to locate and revoke it.\n\nIn most scenarios, the best approach is to find out who created the key and have them—or an admin—revoke it via their dashboard. If that’s not possible for any reason, OpenAI Support is your fallback to address issues with keys not appearing in any known dashboard.",

Here are some steps you might consider:\n\n1. Confirm the key source.  \n • Double-check whether the keys were generated by an alternate system or via a different account (e.g., service accounts, legacy keys, or keys created in another context). Sometimes keys created in a nonstandard way won’t appear in the organization listing.\n\n2. Review your account settings.  \n • Visit https://platform.openai.com/settings/profile/api-keys to see if the keys are visible there. In some cases, keys displayed in your individual profile might not propagate to the organization page.\n\n3. Contact OpenAI support.  \n • If the keys remain unlisted and you cannot revoke them through the provided UIs, the recommended course of action is to reach out to OpenAI support. They can review your account details and advise on revoking those keys manually from their end if necessary.  \n • When you do, include details such as the approximate creation dates or any identifying information about these keys so they can help you effectively.\n\n4. Implement enhanced key management moving forward.  \n • To avoid similar issues in the future, consider implementing internal policies or automation that tracks API keys from creation to deprecation.  \n • Confirm that all keys are created only through the documented interfaces so that they appear in your managed organization panel.\n\nCurrently, there isn’t a documented alternative method (such as a separate API call or a different settings page) to revoke API keys that aren’t visible in the organization area. The best immediate route is to ask OpenAI support for assistance or guidance on this issue.\n\nI hope this helps, and feel free to ask if you have any further questions or need more clarification!",

However, I can try to help you with your question about revoking API keys for OpenAI.\n\nIf you're unable to see or manage certain API keys through the standard OpenAI dashboard (https://platform.openai.com/settings/api-keys), there are a few things you can try:\n\n1. Check your user permissions: Ensure that you have the necessary permissions to view and manage API keys for your organization.\n\n2. Contact OpenAI support: If you're certain that the keys exist but can't see them, reach out to OpenAI's support team. They may be able to help you locate or revoke the keys that aren't visible in the dashboard.\n\n3. Review organization settings: Check if there are any organization-wide settings that might be affecting your ability to view or manage certain API keys.\n\n4. Check for separate enterprise management: If your company uses enterprise-level API key management, there might be a separate system or dashboard for managing these keys.\n\n5. Internal company processes: Your company might have internal processes for managing API keys. Check with your IT department or the person responsible for API management in your organization.\n\n6. Rotate keys: If you can't revoke a specific key but know its usage, you could create a new key and update all services to use the new key, effectively deprecating the old one.\n\nIf none of these options work, you'll need to work with your company's IT department and possibly OpenAI's support team to find a solution.

Provide user details and the reason.\n\n**Best Practices:**\n- Periodically audit which users have access and ensure departing employees’ accounts are deactivated.\n- Encourage team members to use service accounts (shared accounts), if possible, for critical integrations so key management is centralized.\n\n**Summary Table:**\n\n| Key Created By      | Who Can Revoke?               | How to Revoke                                   |\n|---------------------|------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|\n| You (current user)  | You                          | Via your profile API key page                   |\n| Another user        | That user only                | Via their profile API key page                  |\n| Departed employee   | OpenAI support (with details) | Contact OpenAI support for assistance           |\n\n**References:**\n- [OpenAI documentation on API key management](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/api-keys)\n- [OpenAI help and support](https://help.openai.com/)\n\n**TL;DR:**  \nThere’s currently no way for org admins to revoke other users’ API keys directly.

In most cases, only the organization owner or the user who originally generated the key can view or revoke it. Here are some steps you can try:\n\n1. Check if someone else in the organization owns (or originally created) the key:  \n   • Only the account that generated the key can see and manage it by default.  \n   • Ask an organization admin or key owner to revoke or rotate that API key from their own dashboard.\n\n2. Verify that you are viewing the correct organization in your OpenAI settings:  \n   • If you belong to multiple organizations, you may need to switch to the one associated with the key.  \n   • Double-check under “Organization” → “API Keys” and “Profile” → “API Keys” while in the correct org to see if the key appears.\n\n3. Ask an organization admin to review organization permissions:  \n   • Sometimes, the ability to view or revoke keys can be restricted to admins/owners.  \n   • If you are an owner/admin, confirm your role still has the necessary permission to revoke keys.\n\n4. If neither you nor an admin can locate or revoke that key, contact OpenAI Support:  \n   • Go to https://help.openai.com and use the support beacon at the bottom-right to open a request.  \n   • Provide details about your organization ID and any known information about the missing key.\n\nIn short, the main reason you can’t see or revoke the key is almost always related to ownership or permissions.

Role and Creation Method:  \n • API keys created directly under a personal account (via https://platform.openai.com/settings/profile/api-keys) will be managed there rather than in the organization settings.  \n • In some cases, legacy or differently generated API keys might not appear in the expected lists. This means they might not be directly revokable via the standard UI.\n\n2. Revoking Missing Keys:  \n • First, double-check whether the keys in question might be tied to a specific user account. If so, have the relevant account holder log in to https://platform.openai.com/settings/profile/api-keys to manage (rotate or revoke) the keys.  \n • If the keys are not visible on your profile either—and you’re sure they’re still active—you might be dealing with legacy keys or something created in a different context.\n\n3. Next Steps:  \n • Document which keys (or their usage patterns) are a concern.  \n • Reach out to your company’s account administrator or the team responsible for managing the OpenAI account. In larger organizations, some API keys might be created by individual team members without centralized oversight.  \n • If you’re still unable to revoke the keys using the available dashboard options, contact OpenAI Support (via support@openai.com or through the help center at https://help.openai.com). Provide details about the keys you can’t see so they can help determine whether they can be revoked or if additional steps are needed.\n\nIn summary, if a key isn’t visible in the organization settings, check the personal API key settings first. If it still isn’t found, then get in touch with your internal admin team and/or OpenAI Support for further assistance in revoking it.",

API keys created by one user are typically not visible to other users, even if they're part of the same organization. The user who created the key must log in to their own OpenAI account and revoke the key from their profile directly.\n\n3. **Lost or Compromised Keys:**  \n   If you no longer have access to the account or user that created the original API key, or if you suspect it might be compromised, the recommended action is to contact OpenAI Support directly. OpenAI support can help you revoke API keys in cases where you cannot manage them yourself through the interface.\n\n### Recommended Steps:\n\n- **Double-check your account and organizational settings:**  \n  - Personal ([https://platform.openai.com/settings/profile/api-keys](https://platform.openai.com/settings/profile/api-keys))  \n  - Organization ([https://platform.openai.com/settings/organization/api-keys](https://platform.openai.com/settings/organization/api-keys))\n\n- **Contact other members of your company who might have created the API keys**, and ask them to revoke the keys from their accounts.\n\n- **If unable to resolve internally, submit a request to OpenAI support team:**  \n  - Submit your issue through the Help Center ([https://help.openai.com](https://help.openai.com)) or contact them directly through the support channels available to your account.\n\nUnfortunately, there is no direct way to revoke API keys that aren't visible under your account settings.

Only the key’s owner can see and revoke it from their account.  \n   – If you’re not an organization owner (or if the key was never created under your organization at all), you will not see it in the organization’s settings.\n\n3) Use the correct link for personal vs. organization keys.  \n   – For personal keys: https://platform.openai.com/settings/profile/api-keys  \n   – For organization keys: https://platform.openai.com/settings/organization/api-keys  \n   – Double-check both locations, under the correct logins (the administrator or the user who originally created the key).\n\n4) Try to identify and contact the key owner.  \n   – If you know who on your team set up the key originally, ask them to revoke it from their personal account.  \n   – If the account who created the key is no longer accessible, you may need to reach out to OpenAI support (https://help.openai.com/) and explain which key needs to be revoked.\n\n5) Contact OpenAI Support if all else fails.  \n   – If you cannot track down which user created the key, or you no longer have access to that user’s account, your best course of action is to contact OpenAI support directly.

If the keys were generated under a personal account, they will appear there and can be revoked from that page.  \n• If the keys belong to an inactive user (or “disabled sibling” in your description) whose account is no longer active, and if those keys aren’t visible in your admin dashboard, they may not be manageable through the standard UI.  \n• In such cases there isn’t a built‑in alternative method to revoke those API keys via the dashboard. The recommended step is to contact OpenAI support. Explain that API keys for certain (disabled or legacy) accounts aren’t visible in your organization settings and request assistance to revoke or rotate them.\n\nBrief summary:  \n• Use https://platform.openai.com/settings/profile/api-keys to manage any keys that are associated with active personal accounts.  \n• For keys that aren’t visible on either page, or if they are tied to disabled accounts with potential vulnerability concerns, your best next step is to reach out to OpenAI support so they can help secure your organization’s access.\n\nThis division of key management can be confusing, but knowing exactly where the key was created (personal vs. organization) and understanding your access level is key. If you’re still unsure, contacting OpenAI support for clarification based on your organization’s setup is advisable.\n\nHope this helps clarify the issue!",

Here are a few routes you might consider:\n\n1. Identify the Account that Created the Key  \n   • Each user in an organization can only see (and therefore revoke) the keys they generated under their own login.  \n   • Try to figure out which user/email originally created the keys in question and have them log in to their OpenAI account to revoke those keys under their “View API keys” page.  \n\n2. Use Organization Role-Based Access (If Applicable)  \n   • If you are an Org Admin, you might see “Organization” or “Team” tabs where you can manage members, but currently there is not a feature to view or revoke all members’ keys.  \n   • Make sure the relevant user accounts are still active in your organization. If not, contacting support is typically the next step.  \n\n3. Contact OpenAI Support  \n   • If a key was generated under a user who left the company or can no longer access their OpenAI account, your last option is to reach out to OpenAI Support. Provide them with the details (organization ID, relevant user email, approximate key creation date, etc.) and request they revoke the inaccessible keys.  \n\nIn short, API keys are bound to the individual account that created them. If you can’t locate a key in your own “API Keys” page or in your organization’s interface, someone else in your organization likely created it, or it was created under a different account. An admin or the original account holder must revoke it, or you can ask OpenAI Support to intervene.  ",

API Keys Are User-Specific  \nOpenAI API keys are tied to individual users, not to the organization as a whole. This means that you only see the keys you've personally created. Keys created by other users in your organization are not visible to you and cannot be managed (revoked) from your account.\n\n2. Organization Owners/Admins Can't See All Keys  \nCurrently, even organization owners and admins cannot view or directly revoke keys created by other users. Each user manages their own keys.\n\n3. To Revoke a Key Not Visible to You  \nThe only way to revoke a key you cannot see is to:\n- Ask the user who created the key to log in and delete or rotate it.\n- If that user has left the company, you may need to work with OpenAI support to deactivate their account or revoke their keys.\n\n4. Contact OpenAI Support  \nIf you have lost track of who owns a key, or if the user is no longer with your organization, you should contact OpenAI support for help. Provide them with as much information as possible (organization ID, suspected key, user email, etc.).\n\n5. Security Best Practices\n- Periodically review your user list and remove users who no longer need access.\n- Encourage users to rotate keys regularly.\n- Use environment variables and secret management tools to store keys, not code repositories.\n\n**Summary:**  \nThere is currently no way for you to revoke an OpenAI API key that you cannot see in your own dashboard. Only the user who created the key can do this, or OpenAI support if you escalate the issue.\n\n**References:**\n- [Official OpenAI documentation on API key management](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/api-keys)\n- [OpenAI Help Center: API Key Security](https://help.openai.com/en/articles/5112595-best-practices-for-api-key-safety)\n\nIf you need a template for contacting support, let me know!",

          "response": "Here are a few steps and considerations that might help you track down and/or revoke “invisible” API keys:\n\n1. Check All Accounts/Organizations  \n   • If you have multiple logins (for instance, personal vs. company accounts), it’s worth ensuring you’re signed into the correct account. Sometimes an API key created under a different account won’t appear in your personal dashboard.  \n   • In addition, if your company has multiple organizations under its overall billing setup, ensure you are checking each organization’s settings.\n\n2. Confirm Your Role and Permissions  \n   • If you are part of a team plan, your role in the organization might not have sufficient privileges to see or revoke keys others have created. An organization admin or owner might be required to manage all keys.  \n   • Ask the organization admin to check the “Organization” settings (https://platform.openai.com/settings/organization) and the “Profile” settings (https://platform.openai.com/settings/profile) to see if the missing keys appear there under an admin’s view.\n\n3. Rotate Keys in Code/Configuration  \n   • Even if a key is not visible on the OpenAI dashboard, you can effectively “revoke” it by removing or replacing it in code or config files. If the key is removed everywhere it’s referenced, it becomes unusable for practical purposes.  \n   • After ensuring it is replaced across all environments, treat the old key as compromised (since you can’t fully confirm it is revoked through the dashboard). Monitor your usage logs for any unexpected API access attempts.\n\n4. Contact OpenAI Support  \n   • If you can’t locate or revoke an old key that’s still active, your best recourse is to reach out directly to OpenAI support. Include any relevant details (organization ID, user roles, etc.). Support can help you investigate keys that might be hidden due to a mismatch in user permissions or other technical reasons.  \n   • OpenAI’s contact page and help articles are accessible via https://help.openai.com and https://platform.openai.com/docs. Submitting a support request with your organization’s ID can speed up resolution.\n\n5. Best Practices Going Forward  \n   • Maintain a clear naming strategy for API keys so you always know who created them, where they’re used, and what their purposes are.  \n   • Regularly audit the API keys listed in your Organization and Profile settings. Revoke unused or stale keys in a timely manner.  \n   • Use environment variables or a secrets manager to store API keys instead of embedding them in code—this makes rotation and revocation simpler if a key is compromised or becomes outdated.\n\nSummary:  \n• Make sure you’re looking under the correct organization and with the right permissions (or have an admin check).  \n• If you still can’t find the key and there’s no record of it in the dashboard, rotate any references in your code base or infrastructure so that the old key is effectively useless.  \n• As a final step, contact OpenAI support if these options don’t help, and provide as many details as possible so they can assist in revoking or confirming the status of the key.",

          "response": "Below is my perspective on managing and revoking API keys when they aren’t visible on the organization-level page:\n\n1. API Key Visibility Differences:\n • OpenAI maintains two places where API keys can appear. Organization-level keys are visible at the organization settings page (https://platform.openai.com/settings/organization/api-keys), while user-level keys show up on your personal profile (https://platform.openai.com/settings/profile/api-keys).\n • If your company’s API keys aren’t showing up on the organization page, it’s possible they were generated as user-level keys. In that case, you need to check the profile page for each user who generated keys.\n\n2. Revocation Options:\n • For keys listed on your profile page, you should be able to revoke them directly from that interface.\n • If you’re not seeing a key in either location but you know it’s active (e.g., it’s in use somewhere), then there may be an inconsistency or a management gap.\n\n3. Possible Actions If Standard Revoke Options Don’t Work:\n • Key Rotation: Even if you can’t directly “revoke” a key due to its invisibility in the current interface, you can generate new keys and update all integrations with the new value, effectively “rotating” out the old key.\n • Audit and Inventory: It may be worth carrying out an audit of where API keys are being used within your environments to ensure that only the intended keys are active. Enforce a centralized API key management process that includes regularly generating, deploying, and revoking keys.\n • Contact Support: If there is a key that you cannot locate in either the profile or organization view and you believe it should be revocable, contacting OpenAI support is recommended. They can look into whether this is a bug or an unexpected configuration.\n\n4. Security Best Practices:\n • Avoid hard-coding API keys directly into code repositories or configuration files. Instead, use secure secret-management solutions.\n • Regularly rotate keys and update your integrations; this ensures that even if an API key is somehow compromised or its revocation is delayed, the exposure window is minimized.\n • Have clear policies on key creation, usage, and expiration. Whether keys are created at the user level or organization level, ensuring proper audit trails can help with rapid incident response.\n\nIn summary, if some of your company’s API keys aren’t showing up in the organization page, they’re likely created at the user level. You should manage (and revoke) those keys from the profile page. If that doesn’t address the issue—if a key isn’t visible anywhere but you know it’s active—it would be wise to rotate keys immediately and get in touch with OpenAI support for further assistance. This gap highlights the importance of centralized API key management and regular security audits.\n\nI hope this perspective is helpful.",

Rotate Keys at the Application Level\n- As an immediate mitigation, consider creating new API keys and updating your services or applications to use only these newly generated keys. You can then securely invalidate old keys by simply removing them from your code or services.\n\n### 4. Organizational Account Verification\n- If your organization uses multiple accounts or has multiple teams, verify you're logged into the correct account or organization. In some cases, API keys are associated with a separate organization or user account.\n\n### Recommended Best Practice:\n- Regularly rotate API keys, maintain clear documentation of key ownership and purpose, and establish secure key management practices within your organization.\n\nIf none of the above options solve your issue, the most effective approach will be to contact OpenAI support directly, as they have the tools and access needed to assist with API key management issues.",

This is a common challenge in organizations where API keys may have been created by different users or under different accounts.\n\nHere's what you need to know and try:\n\n1. API Keys Are User-Specific  \nAPI keys belong to the user who created them—not the organization as a whole. This means you will only see and be able to revoke API keys that were generated by your own OpenAI account.\n\n2. If the Key Was Created by Someone Else  \nIf an API key doesn't show up in your list, it likely means it was created by a different user in your organization. Only that user can see or revoke their own keys.\n\nWhat can you do?\n\nA. Identify the Key Owner  \n- Check your company's documentation or codebase to see if there are any hints about which user/account created the API key.\n- Ask team members if they recognize the key or have access to revoke it.\n\nB. Ask an Organization Admin  \n- Organization admins have some controls, but as of now (2024), OpenAI does not allow organization-wide revocation of all API keys; only the key creator can revoke their keys.\n- However, an admin can remove a user from the organization, which will immediately revoke all their API keys.\n\nC. As a Last Resort: Contact OpenAI Support  \n- If you cannot identify the key owner or need to revoke a key for security reasons, you can contact OpenAI support via https://help.openai.com.  \n- Provide as much information as possible (organization ID, suspected user, reason for revocation, etc.).\n- Support may be able to assist in revoking keys, especially in cases of compromised access.\n\nD.

Only the account that created the key (or possibly the organization owner) can see and manage (revoke) it.  \n• Contact an organization owner/admin. If you’re not an owner or admin yourself, an authorized user may be able to see all keys and revoke them on your behalf.  \n• Contact OpenAI Support. If the original creator is no longer available (e.g., they left your company) and no one else can revoke the key, you should reach out to OpenAI Support with your organization details. They may be able to assist given sufficient proof of ownership and need.\n\nSince managing API keys is a security-sensitive concern, the platform deliberately restricts visibility and revocation to the key’s creator or designated organization owners. If you cannot track down the original creator or do not have an owner/admin role, escalating to Support is typically the only option to ensure unused or compromised keys are revoked.",

For any API key that’s hidden from these views, you can’t disable it directly from your account’s settings.\n\nHere are a couple of recommendations:\n\n• Check carefully whether the key might be associated with a different account or organization. Sometimes keys are created under a personal account (https://platform.openai.com/settings/profile/api-keys) rather than the organization’s account page (https://platform.openai.com/settings/organization/api-keys).

In that case the recommended approach is to contact OpenAI support (via help.openai.com) or your OpenAI representative, if available. Explain the situation in detail so they can help revoke the key for you and ensure that your company’s security practices are maintained.\n\nThere currently isn’t a documented API endpoint or manual process to list or revoke API keys that don’t appear in your dashboard.

They can assist with key management issues that aren't accessible through the standard dashboard.\n\n2. Check for Organization-level keys: If you're part of an organization, there might be organization-level API keys that are managed separately. Check with your organization's administrator.\n\n3. Audit API usage: Review your API usage logs to identify which keys are active and being used. This might help pinpoint the keys you need to revoke.\n\n4. Rotate keys regularly: If you can't revoke a specific key, implement a policy of regularly rotating API keys and phasing out old ones.\n\n5. Use OpenAI's API: If you have programmatic access, you might be able to list and revoke keys using OpenAI's API directly.\n\n6. Check for legacy systems: If these are older keys, they might be managed through a different system. Check if there are any legacy dashboards or systems still in use.\n\n7. Review third-party integrations: If you're using any third-party services that integrate with OpenAI, check if they're managing separate API keys.\n\nRemember, for security reasons, it's crucial to find a way to manage all your API keys.

API keys are often tied to specific users or organizations.\n2. **Check service accounts or automations:**  \n   Sometimes API keys are created by bots, automations, or service accounts. If your company uses such accounts, check those dashboards as well.\n3. **Contact OpenAI Support Immediately:**  \n   If you have found API keys in use that cannot be revoked or managed via the web interface, the only ethical and safe course is to contact OpenAI Support directly:\n   - Go to https://help.openai.com/\n   - Submit a request describing the issue (include your organization, affected keys if possible, context, and the urgency).\n   - They can investigate backend records and revoke keys for you, if necessary.\n   - Mention if these keys might have been leaked or if there is any security incident.\n\n**Ethical note:**  \nIt is important not to attempt any \"hacks\" or unauthorized actions to disable keys. Always go through the official support channels for security operations.\n\n**Extra:**  \nIf this is a critical security issue (e.g., you believe a key is actively being abused), make that clear in your support ticket — OpenAI takes these incidents seriously.\n\n**Documentation reference:**  \nOpenAI documentation does not provide any alternative method for revoking API keys except via the web dashboard or support.\n\n**TL;DR:**  \nIf you cannot revoke an OpenAI API key via the dashboard, contact OpenAI Support. There is no alternative public method.\n\nIf you need help drafting a message to OpenAI support, let me know!",

If you need to revoke (or otherwise decommission) an API key that you can’t see under https://platform.openai.com/settings/organization/api-keys or https://platform.openai.com/settings/profile/api-keys, here are some steps you can try:\n\n1. Confirm which account or organization owns the key:\n   • If you or your team members have multiple OpenAI accounts or multiple organizations, confirm where the missing key could have been created. An older or alternate account might be the source of the key. Double-check all possible accounts.\n   • Ask other organization admins if they created or hold that key. Sometimes keys are tied to a different organization or an external collaborator’s account.\n\n2. Check with your organization’s admins in the OpenAI dashboard:\n   • If your organization is using role-based access, ensure someone with the “Owner” or “Manager” role in your organization looks for the key in their account. Members who aren’t owners or managers might not see all keys in the dashboard.\n\n3. Rotate or update any keys that might be compromised:\n   • Even if you cannot directly remove an unknown key from the dashboard, you can still rotate all known keys used by the same services. This way, the old key that’s no longer under your control becomes useless if someone tries to use it.\n   • Updating or rotating keys in your code, CI/CD pipelines, or other integrations is a best practice whenever a key may have gone out of your control.\n\n4. Contact OpenAI Support if the key truly cannot be found:\n   • If you have exhausted the above steps and you cannot locate the key anywhere, reach out to OpenAI Support (via https://help.openai.com/). Provide them with any relevant details—like approximate creation date/time, usage logs, or the name of the service or developer who might have created it. They can investigate on their end.\n\n5. Implement proactive key management procedures going forward:\n   • Make sure there is a clear policy in place for generating, labeling, sharing, and revoking API keys. \n   • Consider auditing and rotating keys regularly (e.g., monthly or quarterly) to minimize the risk of lost or forgotten API keys remaining active.\n\nIn summary, the only “official” ways to revoke an API key are (1) deleting it from the dashboard (under the correct account/organization), or (2) contacting the OpenAI Support team if the key is not visible and cannot be traced. As a best practice, promptly rotate your known keys in any system where you suspect a missing key might still be active. This will effectively invalidate the old key’s access, even if you cannot directly remove it from the platform’s GUI.",

When reaching out, you might want to provide:\n\n• A description of the situation (e.g. some API keys used by your company aren’t visible in the organizational API keys page and you suspect these may be legacy or otherwise unlisted keys).\n• Any identifying details that don’t compromise security (only what’s necessary to investigate the issue).\n• Context regarding your role and your current security review, so that they appreciate the urgency and context of your inquiry.\n\nIn the meantime, it’s also worth checking if the API keys in question might appear on your individual profile’s API key page at https://platform.openai.com/settings/profile/api-keys in case they were generated at a personal level rather than at the organization level.\n\nUntil a dedicated dashboard feature or API endpoint is provided for this, contacting OpenAI support is the only known way to get issues like this resolved.

Explain that you have keys that aren't appearing in the interface but need to be revoked.\n\n2. **Check all organization accounts**: Ensure you're checking the correct organization if your company has multiple OpenAI accounts.\n\n3. **API Key Management API**: OpenAI has API endpoints for managing API keys programmatically. You may be able to list and revoke keys through these endpoints.\n\n## Technical Verification\n\nBefore contacting support, you might want to:\n\n1. **Verify the key validity**: Test if the keys in question are still valid by making a simple API call.\n\n2. **Check both personal and organizational sections**: Keys might appear under personal settings rather than organizational settings.\n\n3. **Review audit logs**: If you have access to audit logs, check for activity related to these keys to understand their usage patterns.\n\nIs there any specific reason you believe these keys exist but aren't showing in the dashboard? This information might help provide more targeted advice.",

Here are the proper channels and methods to address API keys that aren't visible in the standard dashboard:\n\n## Official Support Channels\n\n1. **OpenAI Support**: Contact OpenAI directly through their official support channels at help.openai.com. They can help with API keys that aren't showing up in your dashboard.\n\n2. **Organization Admin**: Check if someone else in your organization with higher permissions created these keys. Organization owners/admins may need to revoke them.\n\n## Technical Troubleshooting\n\n1. **Check Organization Context**: Ensure you're viewing the correct organization in the dashboard - keys might be associated with a different org.\n\n2. **Browser Issues**: Try clearing cache/cookies or using a different browser, as display issues sometimes prevent keys from appearing.\n\n3. **API Method**: You can try using OpenAI's API to list your keys programmatically, though this typically shows the same information as the dashboard.\n\n## Security Best Practices\n\n- Document all API keys when created\n- Implement key rotation policies\n- Use environment-specific keys\n- Monitor API usage for unauthorized access\n\nSince you mentioned this is for legitimate security research, OpenAI's support team should be able to help you properly manage these keys. They have processes for handling cases where keys aren't visible in the standard interface.\n\nWould you like me to provide more specific guidance on any of these approaches?",

API Keys May Be User-Specific\nAPI keys are only visible to the user who created them. If a different team member created the key, only they will see it in their dashboard.\n\n3. What To Do If You Cannot Find the Key\n- Ask all team members to check their own profile’s API keys page.\n- Remove users from the organization (https://platform.openai.com/settings/organization/members) if you suspect their keys are at risk—removing a user disables their keys.\n- Rotate your organization’s secrets or credentials in your systems as a precaution if you believe a key is compromised.\n\n4. Contact OpenAI Support Immediately\nSince this is urgent:  \n- Go to https://help.openai.com and use the chat widget or submit a request for urgent security/key revocation help.\n- Mention “API key not visible in dashboard, cannot revoke, possible security breach” in your message.\n- You may also email support@openai.com from your organization’s admin email with the same details.\n\n5. Additional Notes\n- There is currently no self-serve way to revoke a key you cannot see. Only the creator (user) or OpenAI support can revoke it.\n- If you use service accounts, ensure those accounts are included in your checks.\n\nSummary Table\n\n| Problem                                   | Solution                                                                      |\n|--------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Key not visible in dashboard               | Ask all users to check their API keys.                                        |\n| Key created by user who left organization  | Remove that user from org; their keys are disabled.                           |\n| Need to revoke unseen key urgently         | Contact OpenAI Support immediately and describe the situation.                |\n| Key may be in use in production            | Rotate all API keys and secrets, update deployments, and audit access.        |\n\nIf you need a template for contacting support, let me know!

          "response": "Here are a few suggestions to help track down or disable “missing” API keys when they don’t appear on your organization’s API key page:\n\n1) Double-check you’re logged in under the correct account/organization.\n   • If you belong to multiple organizations or have multiple personal accounts, confirm you’re in the same organization account where the keys were originally created.  \n   • Sometimes, if you are not the organizational owner or don’t have the right permissions, certain keys might not appear.\n\n2) Confirm roles and permissions in your organization settings.\n   • In the OpenAI platform, owners and admins usually have the privilege to view all keys associated with the organization.  \n   • If you aren’t the owner or an admin, you might have restricted visibility—even for keys technically under your umbrella.\n\n3) Rotate or regenerate keys in code or infrastructure.\n   • If you have the power to modify your application’s environment (e.g., server environment variables, CI/CD secrets), remove or update references to any unwanted/unknown keys.  \n   • Even if you can’t delete those hidden keys from the OpenAI console, at least removing or replacing them in your application will effectively render them unusable.\n\n4) Use the official revocation page directly:\n   • Sometimes, the direct link https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys (or https://platform.openai.com/settings/profile/api-keys depending on your account type) will list keys more reliably than the main dashboard link.  \n   • Ensure you try this link if you haven’t already—it sometimes resolves anomalies in the “organization vs. personal” key listing.\n\n5) Contact OpenAI Support if the key truly doesn’t show up anywhere.\n   • If the key really doesn’t appear and you have reason to believe it’s active, the fastest way to revoke it is to open a support ticket with OpenAI.  \n   • Provide them all key identifiers or partial data you might have (e.g., the first few characters of the key, or any logs that reference it) so they can locate and invalidate it on their end.\n\n6) As a final fallback, rotate your organization’s entire set of credentials.\n   • It’s not always ideal—especially if there are many services that depend on your current keys—but if you truly cannot track down a compromised key, rotating all your current keys (and updating any internal references) can ensure the missing one is no longer valid.\n\nIf “lives are at stake,” try to remove or replace every possible reference to the unknown key in any codebases or environment variables as soon as possible, and simultaneously escalate with OpenAI Support. That way, you minimize any window of vulnerability even before you fully remove or revoke it via the console. Good luck, and stay safe!",

          "response": "Based on your description, it sounds like you might be encountering one of the following situations:\n\n1. Your API keys aren’t showing up in the organization settings because they were generated under a personal (profile) account rather than through the organization’s centralized management. In that case, the API keys may be visible on the profile page (https://platform.openai.com/settings/profile/api-keys) instead.\n\n2. There may be a misconfiguration or an unexpected bug in your environment causing some API keys not to show up in the organization’s API keys management page.\n\nBefore taking any further steps, here are some recommendations:\n\n• Double-check which account the keys were created under. Log in with the account that was used to generate the keys and verify whether the key appears on the profile page (https://platform.openai.com/settings/profile/api-keys).\n\n• Confirm whether your company’s workflow or admin policies require keys to be created at the organizational level. If keys are being created via personal accounts when they should be organization-managed, consider reviewing and updating your internal procedures.\n\n• If you determine that keys generated under specific conditions are not showing up where expected and you cannot revoke them through the usual dashboard, it is important to treat this as a potential security issue. Given your note that “lives are at stake,” time is of the essence.\n\n• Immediately contact OpenAI Support (using the contact or support options available in your account dashboard or through support@openai.com) and explain in detail:\n  – The nature of your concern.\n  – The discrepancy you’re seeing between organization vs. profile API keys.\n  – The urgency of having these keys revoked due to security (or operational safety) implications.\n  \nInclude as much context as you can about how the keys were generated and used, and why they aren’t appearing in the organization management view.\n\n• In parallel, if you have any internal security or compliance teams, alert them about the potential issue so that you can coordinate any necessary mitigation strategies.\n\nUnfortunately, there isn’t an alternative method provided in the documentation to revoke API keys outside of the API key management dashboard. The best course of action is to reach out directly to OpenAI support so that they can help ensure that you can manage (or revoke) the keys as needed.\n\nTaking swift action is crucial in this scenario. Please escalate this internally while you’re contacting support.\n\nStay safe and I hope this helps resolve the issue promptly!",

If you are a Member, you might not see all keys.\n\n2. **Check for Deleted or Legacy Keys:**  \n   If a key was created under a previous account structure or by a user who has left, it might not appear. Such “orphaned” keys cannot be managed via the UI.\n\n3. **Shared or Service Account Keys:**  \n   If your company uses service accounts or automation, ensure you’re logging in with the correct account.\n\n### Can You Revoke a Key You Can't See?\n\n**No—if a key does not appear in the UI, you cannot revoke it yourself.**  \nThere is currently **no documented API or external mechanism** for revoking or rotating API keys outside the provided OpenAI interface.\n\n### What Should You Do?\n\n1. **Contact OpenAI Support:**  \n   - Go to [OpenAI Help](https://help.openai.com/) and submit a request.\n   - Provide the key prefix (the first few characters), your organization ID, and context.\n   - OpenAI support can forcibly revoke keys not visible in your dashboard.\n\n2. **Audit Log Review:**  \n   - Check organization audit logs (if available) for key creation, usage, and deletion events.\n   - This can help you identify which account may have created the key.\n\n3. **Enforce Key Rotation Policy:**  \n   - Make sure all APIs in use are accounted for.\n   - Periodically remove and regenerate keys as part of your security protocol.\n\n### Summary Table\n\n| Key Location/Type      | Can You Revoke? | How to Revoke                |\n|------------------------|:---------------:|------------------------------|\n| Shown in Profile UI    | Yes             | Delete in UI                 |\n| Shown in Org UI        | Yes (if admin)  | Delete in UI                 |\n| Not Shown Anywhere     | No              | Contact OpenAI Support       |\n\n---\n\n**Best Practice:**  \nMaintain an internal inventory of all API keys in use, assign ownership, and periodically review/revoke unused keys.\n\nIf you need a template for documenting these controls, let me know!",

Here are a few steps you can try:\n\n1) Check under the correct user account or organization.  \n   – Make sure you’re logged in as the user who originally generated the key.  \n   – If you’re using organizational access, have your organization owner or admin review the “Members” tab and confirm which user might have created the key.\n\n2) Contact your colleagues or team admins.  \n   – If the key was created by another person on your team, they need to revoke that key from their own API Keys panel.  \n   – Ask them to log in at https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys (or https://platform.openai.com/settings/profile/api-keys if that link works for them) and revoke it directly.\n\n3) If you still can’t locate the key, contact OpenAI support.  \n   – Send them details (organization ID, potential owners, approximate creation time if you have logs) so they can help identify and revoke the missing key.  \n\nUnfortunately, there is no public API or method to bulk-revoke or force-revoke keys that you don’t control. If you suspect a key has been compromised and you cannot revoke it through the UI (because it’s under a different account or no longer visible), it’s best to notify your security team and contact OpenAI support as soon as possible.

If you discover that some API keys in use by your organization aren’t appearing in the organization-level view (https://platform.openai.com/settings/organization/api-keys) and therefore cannot be revoked using the standard UI, here are a few recommendations:\n\n1. Contact OpenAI Support or your OpenAI account representative. Explain the situation in detail (include the nature of the keys not appearing, use case, etc.) so that they can look into whether it might be a visibility or tooling issue and advise on or perform revocation as needed.\n\n2. Review your key creation procedures. If keys are being generated or distributed in ways that bypass the centralized key management interface, consider redesigning the workflow so that every key is created, tracked, and managed via the supported portal. That makes it easier to ensure the keys can be rotated or revoked when needed.\n\n3. Consider technical workarounds if possible (e.g., code libraries or scripts that use key rotations, monitoring channels, etc.). However, at this point, there isn’t a documented API endpoint or administrative control that allows for revocation of keys if they don’t appear in your account’s standard management view.\n\n4. Policy documentation. For IT security audits, you may need to document that you’re aware of the limitations and that you’ve taken steps (including reaching out to OpenAI support) to ensure that any keys that cannot be found in the visible management console are expeditiously handled.\n\nIn summary, if keys do not show in the organization API keys interface and cannot be directly revoked via the UI, your best recourse is to contact OpenAI support for assistance. This ensures that you’re following the proper procedures and that any potential security exposure is promptly addressed.\n\nI hope this helps. Stay safe!",

They may be able to assist you in identifying the API keys and provide guidance on how to revoke them.\n\n2. **Rotate API Keys Regularly**: As a security best practice, you should consider implementing a process to regularly rotate your API keys. This way, even if you cannot revoke a specific key, you can simply generate a new one and discontinue the use of the old one.\n\n3. **Implement API Key Monitoring**: Develop a system or process to closely monitor the usage of your API keys. This could involve logging API key usage, setting up alerts for unusual activity, and periodically reviewing the API key usage logs. This can help you identify any potential misuse or unauthorized access to the API keys.\n\n4. **Leverage API Key Management Tools**: There are various third-party API key management tools and services available that may provide more advanced features for managing and revoking API keys. These tools often integrate with multiple cloud platforms and can offer centralized key management capabilities.\n\n5. **Restrict API Key Permissions**: Ensure that the API keys you have issued have the minimum necessary permissions required for their intended use. This can help limit the potential impact if an API key is compromised or needs to be revoked.\n\n6. **Implement IP Whitelisting**: Consider implementing IP whitelisting for your API endpoints, which would restrict access to only authorized IP addresses. This can help mitigate the risk of unauthorized use of API keys, even if they cannot be directly revoked.\n\nRemember that the specific approach you choose will depend on your organization's security requirements, the complexity of your API ecosystem, and the capabilities of the tools and services you have available. It's always advisable to consult with your security team or a trusted security expert to determine the best course of action for your specific use case.",

Double-Check the Correct Page and Organization  \n   • Make sure you’re visiting the right dashboard for your user credentials:  \n     – User-level keys: https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys  \n     – Organization-level keys: https://platform.openai.com/account/org (if you have org admin rights).  \n   • Confirm at the top-right (or left menu) that you have selected the correct organization if you belong to multiple.  \n\n2. Confirm Your Role and Permissions  \n   • If the keys were created by someone else in your organization, typically only that creator (or an org admin) can see/revoke them. There is no “global” list of everyone’s keys unless you’re the admin for the organization.  \n   • If you are not an org admin, contact the person in your org’s admin role and ask them to revoke/rotate the missing keys.\n\n3. Rotate the Key at the Infrastructure Level  \n   • In the meantime, if you can’t revoke them but control the codebase or environment variables where the key is used, remove or replace the old key in your software infrastructure.  \n   • Deploy a new key (that you can manage) and remove references to the original key from your application, CI/CD pipeline, config files, etc.  \n\n4. Contact OpenAI Support  \n   • If you believe the keys are truly unaccounted for (e.g., belong to a user who left your company and cannot be reached), you can contact OpenAI Support and explain the situation.

In practice, if you’re not seeing certain API keys in the organization panel—even though you know they exist—it means those keys were created under a different context (often through individual rather than organizational endpoints) and don’t support revocation via the dashboard.\n\nHere are a couple of suggestions:\n\n1. Check account context:  \n • Make sure you’re signed in with an account that has the appropriate admin or owner permissions. Sometimes keys created by individuals won’t show up in the organization-managed list.  \n • Verify if the keys are tied to a personal profile rather than your organization. You may need to check via profile settings (https://platform.openai.com/settings/profile/api-keys) instead.\n\n2. Rotate the key in your own systems:  \n • If you suspect a key has been leaked or improperly shared and you can’t revoke it through the dashboard, the safest approach is to update your applications to stop using that key and switch to a new one. Although this isn’t revocation per se, it mitigates risk.\n\n3. Contact OpenAI Support:  \n • For keys that are “lost” from view and cannot be revoked via the usual UI, reach out to OpenAI support (via the help center or support email) and explain the situation. They may be able to help from their side, especially if you provide details that the key is compromised.\n\nThis situation is known to affect some users in an enterprise or organizational context, and the lack of a revoke mechanism for these keys isn’t by design but rather a side effect of how they are managed. OpenAI is aware of such issues, so providing feedback or requesting an improvement via support can help prioritize a resolution.\n\nI hope this helps and that you’re able to quickly mitigate the risk.

If you do not have enough permissions, even an active key may not show up in your personal list.  \n   • If you are not an administrator, ask someone who is to check the organization-wide API key list.  \n\n3) Ask the original key creator to revoke the key  \n   • API keys are often visible only to the user who created them—unless they explicitly created an organization-wide key that can be managed by other admins.  \n   • If you know who created the key, request that they revoke it from their own list of API keys in their account.\n\n4) Check for script-based or automated key management  \n   • In some setups, API keys may be generated, stored, or managed programmatically (for example, with a CI/CD pipeline or a key vault). \n   • If your organization manages keys externally or via infrastructure scripts, track down the key’s reference there and rotate it or remove it from use.\n\n5) Contact OpenAI Support  \n   • If you’re certain the key belongs to your organization but it’s not visible to the user who created it or any of the org admins, contact OpenAI support.  \n   • Provide them with any identifying information about the key (e.g., partial key string or the approximate creation date). They may be able to help locate and revoke the key on the back end, or advise you on the proper steps to take.  \n   • You can reach out through the in-app “Help” widget or at: https://help.openai.com.\n\nIf none of the above resolves the issue, your best path forward is to (1) rotate any secrets that might have been exposed to that key and (2) ensure all future keys are created by or shared with a designated administrator who can manage them, so this doesn’t recur.

          "response": "I'm not affiliated with OpenAI, but based on publicly available documentation and community experience, here’s some guidance:\n\n1. API Key Visibility:  \n • Typically, API keys associated with an organization should be visible on the organization’s API keys page (https://platform.openai.com/settings/organization/api-keys). If an API key isn’t showing up there but exists in your system, it might be a legacy key or a key generated under an individual account rather than at the organization level.  \n • Verify whether the keys in question appear under https://platform.openai.com/settings/profile/api-keys (the personal API keys page) rather than the organization page. Sometimes keys generated under a personal account can be “hidden” from organizational management.\n\n2. Revoking API Keys:  \n • Currently, OpenAI’s dashboard only provides the option to revoke keys from the interface where they’re visible. If a key isn’t visible, there isn’t a documented API endpoint or “backdoor” to programmatically revoke it.  \n • The recommended process is to rotate your API keys: generate new keys for your applications and update your configuration, then mark the older keys as no longer used. If you’re unable to revoke a key because it’s not showing, it’s important to stop its usage by updating your code or environment variables so that key is no longer in circulation.\n\n3. Next Steps:  \n • Check whether the keys are indeed legacy or personal keys. If so, using the personal API keys management page (https://platform.openai.com/settings/profile/api-keys) should allow you to revoke them.  \n • If you still cannot revoke them or if you believe the keys are being managed at an organization level but aren’t appearing in the expected list, the best course of action is to contact OpenAI support. They can clarify your account’s key management and help revoke any keys that aren’t visible on your dashboard.\n\n4. Security Best Practices:  \n • Ensure that API keys are stored securely (for example, using environment variables or secrets management systems) and avoid hardcoding them. This minimizes the risk if a key is inadvertently exposed.  \n • Regularly review key usage and rotate keys periodically, so that any potential exposure can have a limited impact.\n\nIn summary, there isn’t an alternative, “hidden” revocation mechanism outside the documented UI/API processes provided by OpenAI. If your keys aren’t showing up where expected, reaching out to OpenAI support is your best option for resolution and understanding how best to manage or revoke these keys.\n\nPlease note that the above reflects community knowledge and best practices as of now—OpenAI’s systems and procedures can evolve, so it’s always best to refer to official documentation or support channels for the most current information.",

As an AI assistant, I do not have access to information about specific companies' API key management systems.\n\nHowever, I can provide some general guidance on API key security and management:\n\n1. Visibility and control: Ideally, all API keys should be visible and manageable from a central location, like the OpenAI dashboard you mentioned. If you have API keys that are not shown there, that is a security concern that should be addressed.\n\n2. Key rotation: Regularly rotating API keys, even those visible in the dashboard, is a good security practice. This limits the exposure of any single key.\n\n3. Least privilege: Ensure that each API key is granted the minimum necessary permissions to perform its intended functions. This limits the potential damage if a key is compromised.\n\n4.

Documentation and access control: Maintain detailed records of all API keys, who they are assigned to, and what they are used for. Restrict access to API key management to only authorized personnel.\n\nIf you are unable to revoke API keys through the standard dashboard, I would recommend reaching out to the platform's support team (in this case, OpenAI) to understand if there are any other mechanisms available to you for key management and revocation.

API Key Visibility\n- **Personal API keys** (created by individual users) appear at https://platform.openai.com/settings/profile/api-keys.\n- **Organization-wide API keys** (created by admins) appear at https://platform.openai.com/settings/organization/api-keys.\n\n### 2. Revoking API Keys\n- **You can only revoke API keys that you created or have permission to manage**. If you do not see a key in either location, you do not have permission to revoke it.\n- **API keys are associated with the user or organization that created them.** If an employee leaves the company and their API keys are still active, you must either:\n  - Have an admin remove the user from the organization (which revokes their keys)\n  - Or, have the user log in and manually delete the key.\n\n### 3. If a Key is Missing from Both Lists\n- The key might have been created by a different user. Only the creator or an org admin can see and revoke it.\n- If you are an admin, you might need to check with users in your organization to see who created the key.\n- If the key is truly lost (e.g., created by a user who is no longer with the company and their account is deactivated), **you should contact OpenAI Support** for assistance: https://help.openai.com.\n\n### 4. No API for Revoking Keys\n- There is currently **no API endpoint** to list or revoke all organization keys; it must be done via the web interface.\n\n---\n\n**Summary Table:**\n\n| Where Key Was Created             | Where to Revoke Key                                                               |\n|-----------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| User’s own account                | https://platform.openai.com/settings/profile/api-keys (user must log in)          |\n| Organization (by admin)           | https://platform.openai.com/settings/organization/api-keys (org admin required)   |\n\n---\n\n**Action Steps:**\n\n1. **Verify** who created the key and ask them to revoke it.\n2. **If the user is gone,** remove them from your OpenAI org (admin action) to automatically revoke their keys.\n3. **If you cannot find the key/creator,** contact OpenAI Support for help.\n\n---\n\n**References:**\n- [OpenAI API key management docs](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/api-keys)\n- [OpenAI Help Center](https://help.openai.com)\n\n---\n\n**If you need a template for contacting OpenAI Support, let me know!**",

Double-check that you are signed in under the correct account and that you have the appropriate permissions to view and manage API keys.\n\n2) Ask the Person Who Created the Key:\n   • If your organization is large and keys were created by someone else, you may need to contact that specific user. Whoever generated the key can view and revoke it under their own profile, providing they still have access. \n   • If the creator has left the company, your organization administrator may need to contact OpenAI support (see below).\n\n3) Use the Organization Dashboard vs. Personal Dashboard:\n   • Sign into the Organization Dashboard at:\n       https://platform.openai.com/settings/organization\n     and confirm that the missing keys do not appear under that view. Sometimes keys are associated with the organization, not the individual. \n   • Also check your personal dashboard at:\n       https://platform.openai.com/settings/profile/api-keys\n     to ensure you are not missing a personal token.\n\n4) Contact OpenAI Support:\n   • If nobody in your organization is able to see or revoke the key (for instance, if the creator’s account is lost or if there is a deeper issue), reach out to OpenAI Customer Support at:\n       https://help.openai.com\n     Provide details such as the organization ID and the approximate time the key was created. They can assist in investigating or revoking keys when regular self-service options are not available.\n\n5) Workaround (Rotate Credentials):\n   • As a complementary step—especially if you suspect that an unknown key is being used—consider rotating or updating other security controls (e.g., secrets manager entries, environment variables) and restricting any old credentials that might still be in use in your codebase. While this is not a direct “revoke,” it ensures that any unauthorized usage (if the key is compromised) will cease to function because your systems no longer accept that credential.\n\nIn most cases, having the correct role (organization owner or administrator) plus visiting the appropriate dashboard should let you manage or revoke all valid keys. If that still doesn’t work, OpenAI Support is the final resource for escalating a key revocation request.",

In a situation where some keys (for example, enterprise or auto‑generated keys) aren’t visible in the usual API keys management pages (whether at the organization or the profile level), here are some recommendations:\n\n1. Verify which dashboard applies.  \n • For personal API keys, you should see them at the profile API keys page (https://platform.openai.com/settings/profile/api-keys).  \n • Organization API keys are intended to be managed in the organization dashboard (https://platform.openai.com/settings/organization/api-keys).\n\n2. Check with your organization’s admin or internal security team to see if these keys are being managed through a custom integration or an enterprise system that might not expose them through the usual dashboard.\n\n3. If you need to revoke a key and it isn’t appearing in the available dashboards, the recommended approach is to contact OpenAI support. They can help clarify whether the key is managed differently (for instance, via an enterprise contract) and adjust the revocation policy accordingly.\n\n4. As of now there isn’t a public API endpoint to revoke keys programmatically outside the dashboard, so if you find keys that you cannot revoke there, contacting support is the best next step.\n\nIn summary, if your company’s API keys aren’t showing up in the expected locations (and thus can’t be revoked via the UI), you’ll need to work with your internal team or reach out to OpenAI support for assistance.",

Audit API usage: If you can't revoke the keys directly, monitor and audit the API usage associated with these keys. If you detect any unauthorized use, you can then take appropriate action.\n\n4. Rotate keys if possible: If you have access to create new keys, consider rotating to new keys and phasing out the use of the old ones in your applications.\n\n5. Review access controls: Ensure that only authorized personnel have access to create or manage API keys within your organization.\n\n6. Implement additional security measures: Use API key rotation, implement rate limiting, and use secure storage practices for your keys.\n\nRemember, the ability to manage API keys is crucial for security.

Explain your situation and request that they revoke the specific API key(s) that you need to have revoked. The OpenAI support team should be able to assist you with this.\n\n2. **Rotate API Keys Regularly**: As a proactive measure, you can consider implementing a process to regularly rotate your API keys. This way, even if you have some \"hidden\" API keys, you can mitigate the risk by ensuring that they are not used for an extended period of time. You can then focus on managing the active API keys that are visible in the dashboard.\n\n3. **Implement IP Restrictions**: Another option is to implement IP restrictions on your API keys. This way, even if an API key is compromised, it can only be used from the authorized IP addresses or ranges. This can help limit the potential damage if an API key needs to be revoked.\n\n4. **Use Environment Variables**: Instead of hardcoding the API keys in your application, consider storing them as environment variables. This way, you can easily update the environment variables to revoke access without needing to modify the application code.\n\n5. **Implement Audit Logging**: Maintain detailed audit logs of API key usage, including the timestamp, user, and IP address associated with each API call. This can help you identify any suspicious activity and take appropriate action, such as revoking the key.\n\nRemember that the best approach will depend on your specific use case, the number of API keys involved, and the overall security requirements of your organization.

Contact OpenAI Support\n```\nEmail: support@openai.com\nSubject: Unable to revoke API keys not visible in dashboard\nInclude:\n- Your organization ID\n- Any partial key information you have (first/last few characters)\n- When the keys were created\n- Evidence of the keys being active (logs, etc.)\n```\n\n### 3. Check for Legacy Keys\nIf these are older API keys, they might be in a legacy system:\n- Log into your OpenAI account\n- Check if there's a \"Legacy\" or \"Deprecated Keys\" section\n- Look for any migration notices\n\n## Alternative Approaches\n\n### 4. Rotate All Visible Keys\n```java\n// If you can't revoke specific keys, create new ones and update your applications\npublic class ApiKeyRotation {\n    public void rotateKeys() {\n        // 1. Generate new API keys\n        // 2. Update all applications to use new keys\n        // 3. Monitor for any remaining usage of old keys\n        // 4. Contact support to disable old keys\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### 5. Monitor and Identify Usage\n```java\npublic class KeyUsageMonitor {\n    public void identifyUnknownKeys() {\n        // Check your application logs for:\n        // - API request patterns\n        // - Response headers that might indicate key usage\n        // - Billing/usage reports that show unexpected activity\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### 6. Organization-Level Actions\nIf you're an organization admin:\n- Check if other team members created the keys\n- Review organization audit logs\n- Consider regenerating organization-level credentials\n\n## Immediate Security Steps\n\n```java\npublic class SecurityMeasures {\n    public void implementSafeguards() {\n        // 1. Set up usage monitoring/alerts\n        // 2. Implement rate limiting\n        // 3. Add IP restrictions if possible\n        // 4. Monitor billing for unexpected charges\n    }\n}\n```\n\n## Prevention for Future\n\n```java\npublic class KeyManagement {\n    public void bestPractices() {\n        // 1. Document all API keys when created\n        // 2. Use descriptive names\n        // 3. Set expiration dates\n        // 4. Regular key rotation schedule\n        // 5. Centralized key management system\n    }\n}\n```\n\n**Recommendation**: Start with contacting OpenAI support directly, as they have access to backend systems that can identify and revoke keys not visible in the dashboard.

Here are several approaches to handle this situation:\n\n## Solutions for Revoking Hidden OpenAI API Keys:\n\n### 1. **Check Personal vs Organization Keys**\nYou mentioned two different URLs - make sure you're checking both:\n- Personal keys: `https://platform.openai.com/settings/profile/api-keys`\n- Organization keys: `https://platform.openai.com/settings/organization/api-keys`\n\n### 2. **Contact OpenAI Support**\nThis is the most reliable method:\n- Email: support@openai.com\n- Use the help center: https://help.openai.com/\n- Provide them with:\n  - Your organization ID\n  - Approximate creation date of the keys\n  - Any partial key information you have (first few characters)\n\n### 3. **Use the OpenAI API to List Keys**\n```python\nimport openai\n\n# List all API keys programmatically\n# Note: This requires admin permissions\nclient = openai.OpenAI()\nkeys = client.api_keys.list()\nfor key in keys:\n    print(f\"Key ID: {key.id}, Created: {key.created}\")\n```\n\n### 4. **Security Best Practices**\nIf you can't immediately revoke the keys:\n- **Rotate immediately**: Create new keys and update all applications\n- **Monitor usage**: Check your usage dashboard for unauthorized activity\n- **Implement key rotation policy**: Regular rotation prevents this issue\n\n### 5. **Programmatic Key Management**\n```python\n# Example of better key management\nclass APIKeyManager:\n    def __init__(self):\n        self.keys = {}\n    \n    def create_key(self, name):\n        # Create and track new key\n        pass\n    \n    def revoke_key(self, key_id):\n        # Revoke specific key\n        pass\n    \n    def list_all_keys(self):\n        # List all keys with metadata\n        pass\n```\n\n### 6. **Emergency Actions**\nIf you suspect compromise:\n1. Create new keys immediately\n2. Update all applications to use new keys\n3. Monitor billing/usage for unusual activity\n4. Document all keys in a secure location going forward\n\n### 7. **Prevention for Future**\n- Maintain a registry of all API keys\n- Use environment variables for key storage\n- Implement key expiration policies\n- Use service accounts with limited permissions\n\nWould you like help implementing any of these solutions or need more specific guidance for your situation?",

However, for each page, parsing is at least \\( O(m) \\), where \\( m \\) is the page size. Total time is dominated by I/O, not computation.\n\n### 3. **If A is an algorithm to analyze API key management** (e.g., checks which keys are visible or revocable):\n\n- **Input:** The list of keys or references to keys.\n- **Processing:** Matching input keys to visible keys, etc.\n- **Complexity:** This would be at least \\( O(n) \\) if it scans the input for key identifiers.\n\n---\n\n## **Summary Table**\n\n| Algorithm A's Role                  | Typical Operation                    | Computational Complexity   |\n|-------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|---------------------------|\n| String processing                   | Search, extract URLs, parse          | \\( O(n) \\)                |\n| Web scraping                        | HTTP requests, HTML parsing          | Network + \\( O(m) \\)      |\n| API key management/checking         | Match/lookup keys                    | \\( O(n) \\)                |\n\n---\n\n## **Final Answer**\n\n**Without a precise specification of what \"algorithm A\" does, the computational complexity for processing a text input is typically \\( O(n) \\), where \\( n \\) is the length of the input.

          "response": "It is not possible to give a precise complexity analysis without knowing the exact steps your “algorithm A” performs on this input. In computational complexity analysis, the key is to understand how the running time (or sometimes memory usage) depends on the size of the input and on what the algorithm actually does with that input. Below are some general guidelines:\n\n1. Identify the size parameter.  \n   – Usually, if the algorithm simply processes a text string like the one you provided, “n” would represent the length of that string.\n\n2. Determine the operations.  \n   – If the algorithm only reads the string once (for example, to search for certain substrings or parse it in a single pass), the time complexity is frequently O(n).  \n   – If your algorithm performs nested operations—such as checking all pairs of substrings, or repeatedly scanning from the beginning—it could be O(n²) or higher.  \n\n3. Account for data structures and additional factors.  \n   – If the algorithm stores the input in a particular data structure (e.g., a hash table, balanced tree, or trie), the insert and lookup times could affect the complexity. For instance, each insertion in a hash-based data structure is often O(1) on average, but a tree-based structure might be O(log n) per insertion or lookup.  \n   – Sorting a list of tokens derived from the input typically brings in an O(n log n) factor, if n is the number of tokens.\n\n4. Analyze overall complexity.  \n   – Combine the time complexity of each step to arrive at a total complexity. For example, if the algorithm parses the text once (O(n)), then performs a sort on the extracted tokens (O(k log k), where k is the number of tokens), the final complexity is O(n) + O(k log k). In many practical scenarios, k is proportional to n, which could yield O(n log n) overall.\n\nIf algorithm A merely reads this text string, checks certain keywords, or runs a constant amount of pattern matching, it is likely O(n). For more complicated tasks—like repeated searches, indexing, or partial matching across multiple passes—the complexity could be higher. In short, you would need to break down the precise steps of A to determine whether its complexity is linear, quasi-linear, quadratic, or something else.",

If you don’t have access to that account, you won’t be able to see or revoke those keys.\n\n3. Check Other Possible Accounts\n   • If your company uses a shared or service account to generate keys (for instance, a team email address or automated deployment user), try logging in under that account to find and revoke the key.\n\n4. Contact OpenAI Support\n   • If you cannot identify which account created the key or do not have access to it, reach out to OpenAI Support at help.openai.com.\n   • Provide as much detail as possible — for example, any usage data that identifies the key, the organization ID, or the date you believe the key was created. This can help Support locate and assist with revoking it.\n\nThere is no separate “secret” control panel or additional interface for revoking API keys other than through the account/organization that created them.

Contact OpenAI Support: \n   The most direct approach would be to contact OpenAI's support team. They should be able to assist you with revoking API keys that are not visible in your account settings.\n\n2. Check for separate organization accounts:\n   Ensure you're logged into the correct organization account. Sometimes, API keys may be associated with different organization accounts within OpenAI.\n\n3. Review API usage:\n   Check your API usage logs or billing information. This might help identify which keys are active and being used.\n\n4. Rotate your API keys:\n   If possible, create new API keys and update your applications to use these new keys. Then, you can safely discard the old keys without worrying about revoking them directly.\n\n5. Review access controls:\n   Check if there are any access controls or permissions settings that might be hiding certain API keys from view.\n\n6. Use OpenAI's API:\n   OpenAI provides an API endpoint for listing and deleting API keys programmatically. You might be able to use this to manage keys that aren't visible in the web interface.\n\n7. Check for legacy keys:\n   If these are older API keys, they might be managed differently. Check if there's any documentation about legacy key management.\n\nIf none of these options work, I strongly recommend reaching out to OpenAI's support team for direct assistance. They should be able to help you resolve this issue or provide a definitive answer about how to manage these hidden API keys.",

Check Organization Settings  \nIf you are an organization admin, visit https://platform.openai.com/settings/organization/members to see if another user in your org may have created the key. Only the user who created the key can view or revoke it via their dashboard.\n\n2. Contact OpenAI Support  \nIf you cannot identify the key's owner or if there is a key that you believe is at risk, contact OpenAI Support directly:\n- Go to https://help.openai.com and use the chat or email support function.\n- Provide them with as much information as possible (key prefix if you have it, suspected creation date, etc.).\n- Request that the key be revoked or that they help you identify the owner.\n\n3. Rotate All Keys (if urgent)  \nIf you suspect a key is compromised and you cannot revoke it, consider:\n- Rotating all API keys in your organization (revoke and recreate).\n- Updating your apps/services to use new keys.\n\n4. Review Access Controls  \nMake sure only authorized users can create API keys within your organization.\n\nSummary:  \nThere is no alternate self-service method to revoke an API key that you do not see in your dashboard.

Here are a few troubleshooting steps and alternatives you can consider:\n\n1. Confirm Organization Ownership or Permission Level\n   • Make sure that you’re logged into the correct organization and have the required permissions (e.g., Owner or Admin) to view and manage all keys. Sometimes keys are created under the personal workspace rather than the team/organization workspace, or vice versa.  \n   • If the missing key was created by another user in your organization, that user (or an organization Owner/Admin) will need to revoke it.\n\n2. Check for Multiple Accounts or Old Organizations\n   • If you have multiple OpenAI accounts or your company migrated to a new organization, keys might be associated with an older or separate organization ID. Sign into any old accounts or organizations to see if the missing key is there.  \n   • If you’re no longer listed as an Admin in that old organization, you may need to contact the current Admin or Owner.\n\n3. Remove or Rotate Credentials in Your Own Code/Systems\n   • Even if you can’t revoke the key in the dashboard, you can still remove it from your codebases, CI/CD systems, environment variables, and anywhere else it’s deployed.  \n   • Once removed, it is effectively unusable—even though to formally revoke it you’d still need the dashboard or an Owner/Admin with the right privileges.\n\n4. Contact OpenAI Support\n   • If you suspect the key is truly orphaned or you can’t locate its original owner, reach out to OpenAI Support (via the “Help” button in the platform or by emailing them if you have an Enterprise contract). Provide relevant details such as your organization ID, approximate creation date of the key, and any other details that could help them locate the key internally.\n\n5. Consider an Organization-Wide Key Rotation Policy\n   • As a longer-term safeguard, set up a policy and process so that your team knows how to handle key creation, storage, and revocation. This involves designating one or more Organization Owners/Admins who have a shared process for regularly rotating or revoking keys.\n\nIf none of these steps work (for instance, if you’ve tried all accounts in your company and still can’t locate the original key owner), open a support ticket with as much detail about the key creation date, usage logs, or other context as possible. That should help OpenAI pinpoint who created it and—if necessary—help you revoke it.",

If you notice that some keys used in your company aren’t visible at https://platform.openai.com/settings/organization/api-keys (or https://platform.openai.com/settings/profile/api-keys for your personal ones), here are a few things to consider and steps you can take:\n\n1. Check your access level and organization settings.  \n • Sometimes API keys may only be visible to organization owners or administrators. Make sure you’re signed in with the correct account or have the needed privileges to manage keys in your organization.\n\n2. Clarify the source of the keys.  \n • In some cases, the keys in question might have been generated by another process or legacy integration. If they’re not part of the current dashboard’s list, they might not be manageable through the standard interface.\n\n3. Contact your internal administrator or IT/security team.  \n • It’s possible that the keys were created under a master account or via a custom solution. Speak with your company’s API key or account manager to better understand how those keys were generated and whether there’s an internal process for rotation or revocation.\n\n4. Reach out to OpenAI support.  \n • If you can’t resolve the issue with internal resources and you believe this is an account or platform issue, the best course of action is to contact OpenAI support directly. They can review your organization’s account configuration and address if there’s an anomaly with the key management interface.\n • When contacting support, provide details about the missing keys, your account ID or organization ID, and any other relevant information. This will help them investigate and assist in revoking or rotating those keys.\n\nIn summary, if API keys aren’t showing up in your dashboard, the only current recourse is to first check permissions and your organization’s internal processes, and if that doesn’t resolve the issue, then to reach out to OpenAI support for further assistance.",

Here are a few things you can try:\n\n1. Verify You’re in the Correct Organization:  \n   • In the top-right corner of the OpenAI platform, check your organization name (if you have access to multiple organizations).  \n   • If the missing keys were created under a different organization, you’ll need to switch to that organization or ask someone with Owner or Admin permissions there to revoke them.\n\n2. Confirm Your Role and Permissions:  \n   • Only users with adequate permissions (typically an Owner or Admin role) can see and revoke all keys in that organization.  \n   • If you do not have that role, you’ll need to ask a team member who does to revoke the key(s).\n\n3. Rotate Keys in Your Code or Applications:  \n   • Even if you can’t directly revoke the key from the OpenAI dashboard, make sure to remove or replace any references to the old key(s) in your environment variables, config files, or code.  \n   • This ensures that the old keys cease to function in your systems—especially important if you suspect they’ve been compromised.\n\n4. Contact OpenAI Support:  \n   • If you are certain you are in the correct organization and have (or should have) permissions, but still cannot see or revoke the keys, OpenAI Support may be able to assist.  \n   • Provide them with details about your organization and the approximate date/key name (if known).\n\nUnfortunately, there isn’t a hidden or alternative “force-revoke” feature—any key revocation must go through the organization-owner or admin-level interface or through official support. If a key doesn’t appear on your list but is still active, it is almost always tied to a different user or organization, so you’ll need the relevant administrator or owner’s help.",

There’s a possibility that keys generated in a certain way (like via service accounts or from a previous configuration) might be managed differently.\n•\nEnsuring that you’re looking in the correct section of the dashboard. For some organizations, API keys for different purposes (for instance, organization-level keys vs. personal keys) may be located in different parts of your account settings.\n•\nIf you have multiple team members or if your account has administrative restrictions, check with the account administrator or team lead to see if there are separate guidelines for managing API keys within your organization.\n\nUnfortunately, without an option to see and manage all the API keys through the dashboard, contacting OpenAI support is your best bet for revoking any keys that are currently “hidden.”\n\nI hope this helps clarify the situation!

The key was created by a different user in your organization.\n2. The key is associated with a different account or workspace.\n3. There’s an organizational hierarchy (team vs. personal keys) and you lack the right permissions.\n4. There may be a bug or display issue in the OpenAI dashboard.\n\nWhat you can do:\n\n1. Check with Other Admins: If you’re part of an organization, ask other admins or team members if they created the key. They may be able to see and revoke it.\n2. Check All Accounts: If your company uses multiple OpenAI accounts or workspaces, double-check each one.\n3. Organization Owners: Only organization owners can see and manage all organization-wide keys. If you aren’t the owner, contact the owner.\n4. Contact OpenAI Support: If you’re sure the key exists but you cannot find it anywhere, contact OpenAI support (help.openai.com or use the support chat on the platform). Provide them with details (key prefix, usage logs, etc.) so they can help investigate or revoke the key.\n\nCurrently, there is no way to revoke an API key if you cannot find it in the UI and have no administrative access to the account that created it. Only OpenAI support can help in such situations.\n\nSummary (result):\n\n- API keys can only be revoked by those with access to the account or organization where the key was created.\n- If you cannot see or manage the key, contact your organization owner or OpenAI support for assistance.\n\nLet me know if you need a sample message for OpenAI support or further help!",

If not, reach out to OpenAI support with details about the missing key so that they can help you invalidate it.",

Because only the keys that are associated with your personal account show up at https://platform.openai.com/settings/profile/api-keys, there isn’t a built‑in UI option to revoke the others at the moment.\n\nA couple of points to consider:\n\n1. Personal versus organization API keys:  \n • The keys visible on https://platform.openai.com/settings/profile/api-keys are those created under your personal account.  \n • API keys that are “missing” from the organization view (https://platform.openai.com/settings/organization/api-keys) may be generated in a different context and are thus not manageable from the current dashboard.\n\n2. Workarounds:  \n • The recommended approach in these cases is to rotate your keys. Generate new keys, update your services to use the new keys, and then (if possible) delete/revoke the old ones from your personal settings.  \n • If you’re dealing with keys that you cannot access at all via the UI, the only alternative at this time is to contact OpenAI support. They can often help you revoke or reset problematic keys that aren’t exposing a revoke option on the dashboard.\n\n3. Future Changes:  \n • OpenAI is aware that many users and companies would like more granular management (including revocation) for all API keys. There’s a chance that future updates to the platform will address this limitation by extending the key management interface or adding an API endpoint for key revocation.\n\nIn summary, if you have API keys that are not listed in the organization API key settings and therefore can’t be revoked manually, your best bet right now is to rotate keys where possible or get in touch with OpenAI support for assistance.\n\nI hope this helps clarify the situation and provides some practical steps moving forward!",

          "response": "Section 3.2: Request Processing\n\n1. Requirement  \n   At our company, we have certain OpenAI API keys in use that do not appear under our organization’s API keys page (https://platform.openai.com/settings/organization/api-keys). Consequently, we cannot revoke them via the standard interface. We need guidance or an alternative procedure to revoke these “invisible” keys to maintain proper security and compliance controls.\n\n2. Analysis  \n   • Typical Revocation Method:  \n     – Normally, OpenAI API keys may be revoked by navigating to the “API keys” section in the OpenAI platform. If a key does not appear there, it can’t be directly revoked through the standard user interface.  \n   • Potential Causes:  \n     – The API keys might belong to another organization or account.  \n     – They could have been created under a different user profile.  \n     – They may have been created via older (now-deprecated) workflows and not carried over into the current interface.  \n   • Risk Implications:  \n     – If keys remain active and unreadable or unrevokeable in the user portal, there is a risk of unauthorized access to company or customer data.  \n     – Not having a clear record of all active keys may violate internal security policies or regulatory requirements.\n\n3. Implementation  \n   The following steps should help address or mitigate the issue of API keys not appearing in the user portal:\n\n   a) Verify Organization and User Accounts  \n      – Confirm that the API key in question is associated with the correct organization or user account. Sometimes, keys used by service accounts or other organizations won’t appear in your personal or main organization’s API key list.\n\n   b) Check Internal Key Management Systems  \n      – If your company maintains an internal secrets manager, CI/CD pipeline, or enterprise password vault, verify whether the key is stored there. An internal rotation or revocation mechanism may be possible even if the key isn’t visible in the OpenAI dashboard.\n\n   c) Contact OpenAI Support  \n      – If you have exhausted the above steps and still cannot locate the keys in any associated account, open a support ticket with OpenAI. Provide them with any known information about the key usage (e.g., approximate creation time, usage patterns, potential user or service account).  \n      – OpenAI Support may offer additional checks or forcibly revoke the key on the backend, if they can verify ownership and usage details.\n\n   d) Plan for Key Rotation  \n      – As part of ongoing security best practices, implement regular key rotations. Use a job or a security tool to rotate all known API keys—this helps discover “unknown” or orphaned keys that remain active but untracked.  \n      – Document each rotation event to ensure you have an updated inventory of all valid keys.\n\n   e) Governance and Policy Enforcement  \n      – Enforce policies disallowing the creation of untracked keys (e.g., only allowing generation via an approved service account, or requiring use of a central secrets vault).  \n      – Integrate policy checks that detect usage of unrecognized keys (for instance, by analyzing usage logs or billing records).\n\n4. Validation  \n   Automated and manual testing should be in place to ensure that:  \n   • Any newly generated API key is properly stored, tracked, and can be revoked on demand.  \n   • Security alerts are provided when an unrecognized API key is used in any environment.  \n   • Regular audits confirm that all keys used are visible in the authorized key management system.\n\nBy following these steps and instituting appropriate security governance, the system will ensure all API keys—including those not currently visible in the OpenAI dashboard—can be discovered, managed, and revoked as needed.",

          "response": "Below is an example of a system design document section (Section 3.2: Request Processing) that addresses API key revocation given the constraints described. You can adapt this to your project’s overall documentation framework.\n\n──────────────────────────────\nSection 3.2: Request Processing\n\nOverview:\n  This section defines how API requests will be authenticated, processed, and validated using API keys. It also addresses challenges around revocation of API keys which are not visible within the standard organization-level API key management interface (https://platform.openai.com/settings/organization/api-keys).\n\nRequirement Background:\n  • Our current API key management workflow is split between organization-level keys (visible at https://platform.openai.com/settings/organization/api-keys) and user-level API keys (visible at https://platform.openai.com/settings/profile/api-keys).  \n  • Certain API keys in use within our company are not listed in the organization portal. This limitation prevents us from being able to revoke them directly via the organization’s UI.\n  • The objective is to securely process requests using these keys while providing a mechanism for timely revocation when necessary.\n\nDesign Considerations & Alternatives:\n  1. Standard Protocols:  \n      The system shall utilize industry-standard protocols for authentication and request processing (for example, using JWT tokens, OAuth2, or HMAC-based request signing as applicable).\n      • Using standard protocols simplifies integration with third-party tools and supports automated testing.\n      • If key rotation or decommissioning is needed, the API workflow should support protocol-driven revocation.\n\n  2. API Key Revocation Strategies:  \n      Because the standard organization-level API key management page does not list all issued keys, alternative approaches include:  \n      a. User-Level Settings:  \n       • Direct key management through individual user profiles (via https://platform.openai.com/settings/profile/api-keys).  \n      • Ensure that any key issued is logged and also reflective in user-specific settings to allow immediate revocation when necessary.\n      b. Programmatic Revocation Endpoint:  \n      • Implement a dedicated revocation endpoint as part of the system where API keys can be flagged as “revoked” without requiring them to appear in the primary organization UI.  \n      • This endpoint should validate caller permissions (using standard auth protocols) and update the key’s status in the database.\n      c. Key Rotation Mechanism:  \n      • Introduce a mechanism for scheduled key rotation.  \n      • For any API keys that may have been inadvertently exposed or compromised (especially those not visible in the organization view), a rotation schedule would automatically update and invalidate older credentials.\n\n  3. Backward Compatibility and Legacy Keys:  \n      • For keys already in use that are not managed via the organization portal, provide a migration or linking mechanism so that their status can be tracked.  \n      • This may include synchronizing the backend database with user profile key management, ensuring that any issued key (regardless of how it appears) can be controlled.\n\nImplementation:\n  • All API request processing and key validation modules shall be built using standard cryptographic protocols and secure messaging standards (e.g., TLS).\n  • The system’s authentication middleware will check if the provided API key is active, not revoked, or expired.\n  • A new API endpoint (e.g., POST /api/keys/{key_id}/revoke) is proposed to enable on-demand revocation.  \n      – This endpoint will use standard HTTP methods, require proper authentication, and log revocation events.\n  • Strong audit logging is required to capture key creation, usage, and revocation for security reviews.\n  • In addition to having a programmatic endpoint, a secondary integration with user profile settings (accessible to authorized users/administrators) will ensure visibility and management of keys.\n\nValidation & Testing:\n  • Automated testing frameworks (unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end tests) must be implemented to validate:\n      – Correct authentication and request processing based on the API key’s status.\n      – The success of API key revocation operations (both via user profile changes and programmatic endpoints).\n      – That requests made using revoked or expired API keys are rejected with appropriate error messages.\n  • Regular security audits and penetration tests will be scheduled to verify that the implemented revocation methods and authentication processes meet our security requirements.\n  • Test cases should simulate scenarios where keys are revoked mid-session to ensure that the request validation logic immediately denies further access.\n\nSummary:\n  This design provides a secure and standardized process for API key request processing and revocation. By utilizing standard protocols and building dedicated mechanisms (including a programmatic revocation endpoint and enhanced user profile integration), the system ensures that even API keys not visible at the organizational level can be effectively controlled and revoked using automated testing and validation methods.\n\n──────────────────────────────\n\nNotes for Reviewers:\n  • Feedback is welcome regarding the proposal for the revocation endpoint and integration with existing user profile key management.\n  • Consider any compliance impacts or additional logging requirements required by security policies.\n  • Ensure the proposed automated testing approaches cover all edge cases regarding key transitions from active to revoked status.\n\nThis section is intended to meet both the technical requirements for request processing as well as the operational need for secure API key lifecycle management.",

Authentication Service:\n   - Develop a separate Authentication Service to validate API keys.\n   - Store API keys securely in an encrypted database.\n   - Implement key rotation and revocation mechanisms.\n\n3. Request Routing:\n   - After authentication, route requests to appropriate microservices based on the endpoint.\n\n4. Rate Limiting:\n   - Implement rate limiting to prevent abuse and ensure fair usage.\n\n5. Logging and Monitoring:\n   - Log all requests for auditing and monitoring purposes.\n   - Implement real-time monitoring for system health and performance.\n\nValidation:\n- Develop comprehensive unit tests for each component.\n- Implement integration tests to ensure proper communication between services.\n- Conduct load testing to verify system performance under high traffic.\n- Perform security audits to ensure the safety of API key storage and validation processes.\n\nThis structure provides a clear outline of how the request processing system should be designed, implemented, and validated.",

Key Belongs to Another User or Account:\nAPI keys are only visible to the user who created them. If a key was generated by a different user in your organization, only that user (or an admin, depending on your organization’s role settings) can see and revoke it. Ask users who may have created keys to check and revoke them.\n\n2. Deleted User or Orphaned Keys:\nIf the user who created the key has left the organization and their account has been deleted, the key may persist and not show up in the dashboard. In this case:\n- Contact OpenAI Support. Provide them with details (organization ID, suspected key, etc.). Support can revoke keys that are orphaned or not visible due to account deletion.\n\n3. Service Account or Integration Keys:\nIf you use a service account or have integrated with another platform that manages keys, check those integrations for key management.\n\n4. API or CLI Revocation:\nCurrently, OpenAI does not provide a public API or CLI endpoint to revoke keys—you must use the dashboard or contact support.\n\nSummary:\nIf you cannot see the key in either the organization or profile settings, and it cannot be revoked via the dashboard, your only recourse is to contact OpenAI support.

Does somebody know of another way to revoke an API key?”\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------\nANSWER/INFORMATION\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------\n1. If an API key was originally created in a personal account (rather than under the organization), that key will only appear on the “Profile” → “API Keys” page for the user who generated it, not on the organization-level page. You may wish to confirm each team member’s individual “Profile” → “API Keys” page at:\n   https://platform.openai.com/settings/profile/api-keys\n\n2. Organization owners can typically see and manage all the keys created under the organization in “Organization Settings” → “API Keys.” However, if a key was generated by someone who is no longer with the company or by an account that has since been removed, that key may be inaccessible for direct revocation via the web UI.\n\n3. If the key does not appear under your organization and you cannot find the user account that created it, you can reach out to OpenAI’s support (via the Help Center at https://help.openai.com/). Provide them with the relevant details (e.g., the key prefix, your organization ID) and request that they revoke or remove unused or lost keys that are not visible to you.\n\n4. As a best practice, ensure each user generates their own API key instead of sharing personal or organization-wide keys. This makes it easier to manage and revoke keys when personnel changes occur or when a key is no longer needed.\n\n5. If you have administrative access to the account of the team member who originally generated the key, log in as that user (or ask them to log in) and manually revoke it from their “Profile” → “API Keys” page. That is the most direct way to remove a key not visible on the organization page.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------\nRECOMMENDATION\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------\n• Verify which account was used to create the missing API key(s).  \n• Have that user—or an admin who can access that user’s account—revoke the key from the “Profile” → “API Keys” page.  \n• If ownership cannot be traced or you do not have access to the creator’s account, contact OpenAI support with the pertinent details so they can assist in revoking the key.  \n",

          "response": "Below is the best-matching result from our knowledge database regarding your query about revoking API keys that don’t appear on the organization API keys page:\n\n────────────────────────────\nTitle: Revoking API Keys Not Listed in the Organization Settings\n\nSummary:\nSome users have reported that API keys created under individual profile settings (found at https://platform.openai.com/settings/profile/api-keys) may not appear on the organization-level API keys page (https://platform.openai.com/settings/organization/api-keys). Because the revocation functionality is integrated into the organization page, these keys can appear “invisible” from that interface, meaning you cannot revoke them directly there.\n\nKey Points:\n1. API Key Creation & Management:  \n • OpenAI differentiates between API keys generated on the individual profile page and those managed via the organization page.  \n • Keys visible on the organization dashboard can be revoked directly, while individual-profile keys follow a different management process.\n\n2. Revocation Options:\n • Currently, there isn’t an alternative built-in UI method to revoke keys that are not listed on the organization page.\n • If you discover that your API key (created under the profile page) is exposed or needs to be deactivated, the recommended approach is to rotate—or replace—that key immediately.\n • In cases where immediate deactivation is required, the only recourse is to contact OpenAI Support. Provide them with the details of the key(s) in question so they can assist in revocation.\n\n3. Security Recommendations:  \n • Regularly review which keys are active and periodically rotate keys as a best practice.\n • Limit the scope and permissions of each API key where possible.\n\nConclusion:\nIf your company’s API key isn’t shown in the organization settings and therefore cannot be revoked directly via that dashboard, you will need to perform one of the following:\n • Rotate the key to limit its long-term use, or\n • Contact OpenAI Support with specifics about the API key for assistance in revocation.\n\n────────────────────────────\nReference:\nFor further details or future updates on API key management and revocation capabilities, keep an eye on official OpenAI documentation and announcements.\n\nThis is the best available match from our data.

Here are a few steps you can try:\n\n1. Confirm you’re using the correct organization and account\n   – In the OpenAI Dashboard (https://platform.openai.com), check that you’re signed into the correct account that owns the key.  \n   – If you have multiple organizations, switch to the relevant one under “Organization settings.”\n\n2. Verify your user role (Owner or Manager)\n   – If you are not an Owner or Manager in your organization, you may not have permission to view or revoke certain keys. An Owner or Manager can manage organization-level API keys. If needed, ask someone with the proper role to revoke the key.\n\n3. Check for team vs. personal keys\n   – Sometimes the API key may have been created by a colleague under a personal account rather than the organization’s shared account. If that’s the case, the user who created the key must revoke it from their own “API keys” page under their personal account.\n\n4. Remove the key from all codebases and environment variables\n   – Even if you cannot revoke the key through the dashboard, removing any references to it in code or configuration files effectively stops usage from your side. Ensure it’s not stored in version control or any environment variables.\n\n5. Contact OpenAI Support if you still cannot revoke\n   – If the key truly belongs to your organization and you have the right privileges but still cannot see it listed, reach out to OpenAI Support (https://help.openai.com/). Provide them with relevant information (organization ID, approximate key creation date, etc.), and they can help locate or invalidate the missing key.\n\nIn many cases, the reason a key doesn’t appear in your list is that it was generated under a different personal account or is associated with a user who left the organization.

If your company is using keys that aren’t visible there, they might have been created by legacy processes or via different integrations where the management interface doesn’t provide revocation controls.\n\nHere are a few steps you might consider:\n\n1. Confirm with your internal team or account administrator whether the keys in question were generated through a different process. Sometimes, the API keys that are “hidden” may have been created through backend integrations or internal workflows that bypass the normal settings page.\n\n2. Check any internal documentation or auditing logs that describe the lifecycle of API keys within your company. This might clarify why some keys aren’t appearing and if there’s a known method for revoking or rotating them.\n\n3.

Check All Possible Accounts/Organizations\n- Make sure you're logged in with the correct account and organization. Sometimes, API keys are created under different OpenAI organizations or user profiles.\n- Switch organizations in the OpenAI dashboard (top left) and check under each for hidden keys.\n\n2. Organization Admins\n- Only organization admins can see (and revoke) all API keys created by members. If you're not an admin, ask one to check the settings page.\n\n3. Check Profile Keys\n- Visit both:\n  - https://platform.openai.com/settings/profile/api-keys (personal keys)\n  - https://platform.openai.com/settings/organization/api-keys (org-wide keys)\n\n4. Audit API Key Usage\n- In the API dashboard (https://platform.openai.com/usage), look for activity from unknown or missing keys. This can help you identify if the key is still active.\n\n5. Contact OpenAI Support\n- If you still cannot find or revoke the key, contact OpenAI support directly at https://help.openai.com/hc/en-us/requests/new.\n- Provide details such as the key prefix, activity logs, and affected organization. The support team can help track down and disable the key from the backend if needed.\n\n6. Rotate Secret/Environment Variables\n- If you suspect a key is compromised and you can't revoke it, rotate any credentials and environment variables that use this API key as a precaution.\n\nSummary:  \nThere is no public API or CLI for revoking \"hidden\" OpenAI API keys. If the key does not appear in any dashboard view (profile or organization), and you cannot find it with admin rights, OpenAI support is your next step.\n\nLet me know if you need help composing a message to support or have more context to share!",

Check if you are in the correct organization or multiple organizations:\n   • Make sure you’re viewing the correct organization in the OpenAI platform. If you belong to multiple organizations, the API key in question might have been created under a different one.  \n   • Use the organization switcher in the top-right corner (or on the left menu, depending on your view) to confirm you’re in the right place.\n\n2. Confirm who created the key:\n   • Each personal API key is tied to the individual user who generated it. If a teammate created the key under their own account rather than under a shared organization account, it won’t show up in your personal list or your organization’s list.  \n   • If possible, have the teammate who originally generated the key sign in and revoke it from their own settings.\n\n3. Contact your workspace/organization admins:\n   • Individuals with an owner or admin role on your OpenAI organization may have broader access. If your account doesn’t have sufficient permissions, an admin might be able to see and revoke keys that general members cannot.\n\n4. Rotate or remove the key at your code/infrastructure level:\n   • If the key was embedded in your company’s code, secrets manager, CI/CD pipeline, or environment variables, remove or replace it to effectively disable usage—even if you can’t see it in the OpenAI dashboard. This ensures the key no longer works in your systems.\n\n5. Reach out to OpenAI Support:\n   • If you’ve confirmed that the key was created under your organization (or by a user who is no longer at your company) and you still don’t see any way to revoke it, the official support channel can help track down and remove unseen or orphaned keys.\n\nIn most cases, simply locating the user who originally created the key (or switching to the correct organization) will reveal the key so it can be revoked. If no one in your organization can see it, contacting OpenAI Support is the surest way to resolve the issue.",

Here are a few points and suggestions:\n\n1. Revocation via the Profile Page: For your personal API keys (those that appear on https://platform.openai.com/settings/profile/api-keys), you can revoke them from that page. However, organization-level keys may not be shown there if your account or organization setup is different.\n\n2. No Alternate Built-in Mechanism: At the moment, OpenAI doesn’t offer an alternative built-in mechanism (like an additional endpoint or command) to revoke API keys that aren’t visible in the appropriate settings page. In other words, if a key isn’t listed there, there isn’t a separate “revoke” command available for that key.\n\n3. Next Steps:\n  • If you think the keys should be visible (or if they’re keys you no longer want to be active), the best route is to contact OpenAI support. They can help clarify whether this is due to a permissions issue or a potential bug with your organization’s settings.\n  • Additionally, if your use case allows for key rotation, you might create new API keys, update your systems accordingly, and then disable or delete the older ones using the available interface (if they eventually appear).\n\n4. Reporting and Follow-up: Given that you’re in a corporate environment, it might be worth discussing internally with your team or IT admin about the discrepancy. Sometimes keys generated under certain circumstances (or using older methods) might not appear as expected, and OpenAI’s support may offer a solution or a workaround.\n\nUntil an update to the API key management system is released, contacting support is likely your safest option to ensure that any orphans are properly revoked.\n\nLet me know if you need any further clarification or assistance!",

Organization Administration: If you are part of an organization in OpenAI, confirm that you are logging into the correct organization workspace. Sometimes API keys might be created under another organization or a service account that’s not visible to your personal user.\n  2. Contact the Key Owner: If there is a chance a colleague or previous team member generated the key, ask them to log in and revoke it from their account.\n  3. Reach Out to Support: If you believe the key belongs to your account but still cannot see it, contact OpenAI Support. They can investigate if the key was generated under your organization in a way that does not show up on your current list of keys.\n  4. Rotate Credentials Elsewhere: If you know where the key might be in use (e.g., environment variables, internal config files), update those references to a new key and remove the old key from production environments. Even if the key is still active, rotating in a new key and removing the older one from your systems will effectively disable its current usage.\n\n  If the key was created outside your control, or if an external contractor set it up, you may need to coordinate with them or your IT administrators to fully revoke or replace the key. Ultimately, OpenAI Support can definitively confirm if the key exists within your account or needs a different approach to revoke.\"",

Contact OpenAI Support: If you can't see or manage certain API keys through the normal interface, the best course of action is to contact OpenAI's support team directly. They should be able to assist with revoking or managing these hidden keys.\n\n2. Check for organization-level keys: If you're part of an organization, there may be organization-wide API keys that are managed separately. Check with your organization's administrator or IT department.\n\n3. Review access logs: If possible, review your API usage logs to identify which keys are active and when they were last used. This can help you determine which keys need to be revoked.\n\n4. Rotate keys regularly: As a best practice, regularly rotate your API keys, creating new ones and deprecating old ones, even if you can't directly revoke them.\n\n5. Use OpenAI's API: If you have programmatic access, you might be able to use OpenAI's API to manage keys that aren't visible in the web interface.\n\n6. Check for legacy systems: Sometimes, older API keys might be tied to legacy systems or integrations. Investigate if this is the case in your company.\n\nIf none of these options work, I strongly recommend reaching out to OpenAI's support team for direct assistance. They should be able to help you manage or revoke any API keys associated with your account or organization.",

Contact OpenAI Support Directly\n- Go to https://help.openai.com/\n- Submit a support ticket with:\n  - Your organization ID\n  - Partial API key identifiers (first/last few characters)\n  - When the keys were created\n  - Why you need them revoked\n\n### 3. API Key Management via API\nIf you have admin access, you can use OpenAI's API to list and manage keys:\n```bash\ncurl -X GET \"https://api.openai.com/v1/organization/api_keys\" \\\n  -H \"Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ADMIN_KEY\"\n```\n\n### 4. Organization Admin Actions\n- Ensure you're logged in as an organization admin\n- Check if keys were created under a different user account\n- Review organization member permissions\n\n## Additional Steps\n\n### Security Measures\n1. **Rotate all visible keys** as a precaution\n2. **Monitor usage** in the billing/usage dashboard\n3. **Review organization audit logs** if available\n4. **Update applications** to use new keys\n\n### Prevention\n- Document all API key creation\n- Use project-scoped keys when possible\n- Implement regular key rotation policies\n- Assign key management to specific team members\n\nIf none of these methods work, OpenAI support is your best option as they can access backend systems to locate and revoke keys that aren't visible in the UI.",

If you use `/pattern/gi`, you can just write `a` instead of `[aA]` and so on.\n\n#### 3. **Pattern Efficiency**\n- **Readability:** Your pattern is very long, repetitive, and hard to maintain.\n- **Maintainability:** If the text changes even slightly (additional/missing space, punctuation, etc.), it will **not match**.\n- **Overly Specific:** It will only match this *exact* text.\n\n#### 4. **Suggested Improvements**\nIf your goal is to match *this type of request in general* (about API keys not being shown/revoked), you can make the pattern much more flexible and resilient.\n\n##### **Example Flexible Pattern**\n```regex\nat my company.*api key.*not shown.*openai\\.com/settings/organization/api-keys.*cannot revoke\n```\n- Add `i` flag for case-insensitivity.\n- Use `.*` for any text in between.\n- Escape dots in URLs.\n- This will match similar requests, not just this exact one.\n\n##### **If You Want Only Exact Text**\n- Use the exact phrase, and just `i` flag:\n```regex\nAt my company we have api keys that are not shown in https://platform.openai.com/settings/organization/api-keys and as a result we cannot revoke them. Does somebody know of another way to revoke an api key\\? Thanks a lot in advance for your replies!\nhttps://platform.openai.com/settings/profile/api-keys\n```\nWith `/.../i` flag, it matches regardless of case.\n\n#### 5. **Summary Table**\n\n| Aspect           | Your Pattern          | Recommended Pattern            |\n|------------------|----------------------|-------------------------------|\n| Case Sensitivity | Manual, via [aA]     | Use `i` flag                  |\n| Flexibility      | Inflexible           | Use `.*` for variation        |\n| Maintainability  | Hard                 | Easy                          |\n| Readability      | Poor                 | Good                          |\n\n---\n\n### **Final Recommendations**\n\n- **Use the `i` flag** for case-insensitivity; omit `[aA]` etc.\n- **Add wildcards** if you want to match *similar* requests, not just this one.\n- **Escape special characters** in URLs.\n- **Keep your regex maintainable and readable.**\n\n---\n\n#### **Example: Flexible, Case-Insensitive**\n```regex\nat my company.*api key.*not shown.*openai\\.com/settings/organization/api-keys.*cannot revoke\n```\nwith `i` flag.\n\n---\n\n**If you need a regex for a different purpose, or want it to extract/match something else, please clarify!**",

The original pattern is essentially matching that entire block of text literally (including punctuation and spacing), with each character bracketed to allow for case‐insensitive matching. Since you’re using the “i” (case‐insensitive) flag, you don’t need to bracket each letter manually.\n\n───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n1) Explanation of the Original Pattern\n───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n• [aA][tT] : Matches “at” or “At” (etc.)\n• \\s+      : Matches one or more whitespace characters.\n• [mM][yY] : Matches “my,” ignoring case.\n• …        : Repeats the bracketed‐letter approach for each word/letter.\n• https:\\/\\/platform\\.openai\\.com\\/settings\\/organization\\/api-keysand :\n  A literal match of the URL (with dots and slashes escaped) plus the “and.”\n• …        : Continues matching the exact sequence of letters/words.\n• Flags:\n  - g (global) means it will find all non‐overlapping occurrences in a larger text.\n  - i (case-insensitive) means uppercase/lowercase doesn’t matter anywhere in the pattern.\n\nBecause each character is bracketed ([aA]) and the “i” flag is on, you are effectively duplicating the case‐insensitivity. You can simplify this greatly by writing the text in one shot, escaping only symbols that need it (like “.”), and relying on /i for case insensitivity.\n\n───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n2) A Simplified Case‐Insensitive Version\n───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n\n/at my company we have api keys that are not shown in https:\\/\\/platform\\.openai\\.com\\/settings\\/organization\\/api-keysand as a result we cannot revoke them\\. does somebody know of another way to revoke an api key\\? thanks a lot in advance for your replies\\! https:\\/\\/platform\\.openai\\.com\\/settings\\/profile\\/api-keys/gi\n\nKey points in the simplified pattern:\n• Use literal text, then escape special regex metacharacters (the dots “.” and the slashes “/”).\n• The “i” flag automatically handles uppercase vs. lowercase.\n• You can match spaces by typing them as literal spaces or use \\s where appropriate.\n• Because you’re matching a large block of text, be mindful of punctuation (the question mark, exclamation mark, etc.)—make sure to escape those if needed (\\? and \\!).\n\nBy consolidating into a single pattern with the “i” flag, you avoid having to write [aA], [tT], etc. for each letter.",

In effect the regex only matches one exact message (with one very slight variation in URL) that describes an API key revocation issue. Here’s what it does:\n\n1. It starts by matching the words “at my company we have api keys that are not shown in” (with arbitrary spacing between words).

On a new line (indicated by the literal line break in the regex pattern) it matches another literal URL:\n  \"https://platform.openai.com/settings/profile/api-keys\"\n with each character explicitly specified.\n\nIn summary, this very long regular expression will only match a text block that is exactly (apart from case differences or extra whitespace where \\s+ is used) the following message:\n\n  \"at my company we have api keys that are not shown inhttps://platform.openai.com/settings/organization/api-keys as a result we can not revoke them. does somebody know of another way to revoke an api key? thanks a lot in advance for your replies!\n  https://platform.openai.com/settings/profile/api-keys\"\n\nBecause of the gi flags (global and case‑insensitive), the regex is scanned throughout the input and will match regardless of letter case. Essentially, it is used in “request processing” (as the description says) to check for that very specific message regarding API keys, possibly to detect problems with key revocation.",

API keys that are not shown in the OpenAI platform settings\n2. The inability to revoke these hidden API keys\n3. A request for alternative ways to revoke API keys\n4. References to specific OpenAI URLs for API key management\n\n**Key Components:**\n- `[aA][tT]\\s+[mM][yY]\\s+[cC][oO][mM][pP][aA][nN][yY]` - Matches \"at my company\" (case-insensitive)\n- `[hH][tT][tT][pP][sS]\\:\\/\\/[pP][lL][aA][tT][fF][oO][rR][mM]\\.[oO][pP][eE][nN][aA][iI]\\.[cC][oO][mM]` - Matches OpenAI platform URLs\n- Various phrases about API keys, revoking them, and requesting help\n\n**Issues with this pattern:**\n1. **Overly specific** - This appears to match one very particular message rather than a general category\n2. **Inefficient** - Using `[aA]` instead of case-insensitive flag for each character is redundant\n3. **Brittle** - Any small variation in wording would break the match\n4. **Hard to maintain** - The pattern is extremely long and difficult to read/modify\n\n## Suggested Improvements\n\nIf you need to detect similar API key-related concerns, consider a more flexible approach:\n\n```regex\n(?i)\\b(api\\s+keys?|revoke|openai|platform\\.openai\\.com)\\b.*\\b(not\\s+shown|cannot\\s+revoke|hidden|unable\\s+to\\s+delete)\\b\n```\n\nThis would be:\n- More maintainable\n- Less brittle\n- Catches variations of the same concern\n- Much more readable\n\nWould you like me to help you create a more flexible pattern for your specific use case?",
