          "response": "This is a great question, and you’re not alone—striking this balance is a classic challenge with LLM-driven filters!\n\nHere are a few strategies and considerations from past work on similar systems:\n\n**1. Explicit, Layered Instructions:**  \nInstead of a single broad instruction, break your prompt into steps. For example:  \na) Ask the LLM to extract and list actions requested in the user message.  \nb) Then, ask it to check if those actions are in the allowed set.  \nThis reduces hallucination because you’re guiding the model to reason stepwise.\n\n**2. Provide Diverse, Realistic Examples:**  \nInclude both “strict” and “colloquial” phrasings in your prompt—e.g.,  \n- \"delete this channel\"  \n- \"kinda delete this channel\"  \n- \"could you maybe make a new channel?\"  \nShow which are valid and which are not, and why. LLMs learn to generalize better with a range of examples.\n\n**3. Use Disambiguation:**  \nAsk the model to respond with a clarifying question if the intent is ambiguous, rather than rejecting or accepting. This catches edge cases without being overconfident.\n\n**4. Scope Boundaries:**  \nExplicitly instruct the model to ignore or flag unrelated requests (\"tell me a joke\") and return ONLY actions within the scope. Example:  \n\"If the user asks for any action that is not in the allowed list, respond with 'out-of-scope' and do not process any other part of the request.\"\n\n**5. Consider Two-Pass Validation:**  \nFirst pass: Isolate and extract candidate actions.  \nSecond pass: Validate each against the allowed list.\n\n**6. Test with Adversarial Inputs:**  \nRegularly test using intentionally tricky examples—mixing valid/invalid actions, indirect language, etc.—to see where your prompt fails.\n\n**7. Accept Some Imperfection:**  \nNo prompt will be perfect. Decide on your risk tolerance and use downstream checks (in code or with the more expensive model) as a safety net for anything that gets through.\n\nIf you want to discuss particular prompt phrasings or tradeoffs, happy to dive deeper—just reply here or DM!",

          "response": "I’ve definitely run into something similar when designing multi-tier LLM pipelines. The trickiest part is that the “gatekeeper” prompt can’t be too rigid or it starts misreading everyday language, but it also can’t be too loose or it’ll wander into corners it shouldn’t. A couple of things that have helped me:\n\n1. Approximating user intent vs. literal text:  \n   • Sometimes a user’s request is phrased in a casual or indirect way (“kinda remove,” “sorta do X”), but the core action is the same (“delete,” “remove,” “create”). Making your gatekeeper parse out what the real, standard intent is—rather than fixating on exact phrasing—can fix the “over-rejecting” problem.  \n   • Incorporating a few example user prompts in your gatekeeper prompt is really helpful. Show how to interpret colloquialisms and synonyms as valid requests.\n\n2. Pairing relevant instructions with minimal context:  \n   • I’ve found that giving the gatekeeper too much detail about the system or about subsequent steps nudges it to go beyond simple validation and start “solving” or adding content. In other words, keeping the gatekeeper fairly single-purpose can help.  \n   • If the gatekeeper has any knowledge at all about how the bigger, more expensive model works, it can lead it to attempt to do the entire job itself, or to hallucinate. Try removing extraneous system details and focusing the gatekeeper on a small, tight list of “if you see X, output Y; otherwise pass it along.”\n\n3. Using an allowlist + blocklist approach for out-of-scope user requests:  \n   • Sometimes having the gatekeeper rely on an explicit list of in-scope actions (create channel, delete channel, etc.) vs. out-of-scope or disallowed actions (those that break policy) can keep it from straying.  \n   • This might look like: “If the user’s request is close to any item in the valid set (synonyms or similar phrasing allowed), pass it along. If it’s obviously out of scope or disallowed, filter.”  \n   • This structure can prevent the gatekeeper from “thinking” it should reformulate the request or handle new, unexpected tasks.\n\n4. Iterating with real logs and user scenarios:  \n   • The best feedback often comes from letting real or sandbox user traffic hit your gatekeeper prompt. Log which requests get incorrectly blocked or incorrectly allowed, then refine from there.  \n   • Typically, you’ll find patterns in phrasing or user style that the model consistently misinterprets—these can be plugged into your instructions or examples.\n\nNothing’s perfect, but these guardrail “mini-systems” usually get pretty good with iterative tuning. Happy to chat more if you’d like!",

          "response": "It sounds like you’re tackling one of the classic trade-offs in prompt design—balancing between strict rule enforcement and being flexible enough to capture user intent in natural language. Here are a few thoughts and strategies that might help:\n\n1. Use a multi-stage evaluation. Instead of trying to cover everything in one prompt, consider a sequential approach. For example, start with a rough classification of the intent, then in a follow-up step, verify if the detected intent is valid based on a stricter set of criteria. This can separate the “colloquial language parsing” from the “action validity” logic.\n\n2. Introduce an intermediate representation. Have the gatekeeper LLM output a canonicalized “intent” or a structured summary (like an action label such as DELETE_CHANNEL) along with a confidence score. Then, apply a secondary rule-check on that structure. This reduces ambiguity and helps you discard extra or out-of-scope details like unsolicited jokes.\n\n3. Use example-based calibration. You might fine-tune or craft your prompt with a range of examples that include colloquialisms and mixed requests. For instance, show that “kinda delete this channel” should resolve to a delete request, whereas “create a channel and tell me a joke” should flag the joke portion as outside the valid intent. Providing a mix of examples helps set the expected behavior.\n\n4. Build in guardrails for extraneous content. Explicitly instruct the LLM to only consider commands related to actions you support. You might say something like, “If an input contains multiple requests, extract only the ones that reference channel management.” Or, instruct the model to respond with an error when it encounters unsupported instruction fragments, ensuring that you’re not mixing domains.\n\n5. Leverage chain-of-thought or intermediate reasoning. Ask the LLM to explain how it understood the request before finalizing its decision. This not only helps debug unintended behavior but can also provide you with signals (via its reasoning) when it’s uncertain or when there’s a mix of intents.\n\n6. Consider thresholding. Instead of a hard binary decision based solely on the language of the prompt, you might incorporate confidence metrics. If the LLM seems lower on confidence about the intent extraction or detects extraneous information, that might trigger a safe fallback or further review.\n\n7. Iteratively test and refine. Like many LLM filtering systems, your system might benefit from continuous iteration based on real-world use cases. Logging edge cases (both false negatives and false positives) and tuning prompt examples accordingly can gradually improve balance over time.\n\nEach of these strategies helps manage the complexity inherent in natural language inputs. They allow for both robustness and safety without being overly brittle.\n\nIt sounds like you’re on the right track, and a mix of these approaches might help you get to the sweet spot between understanding variety in user phrasing and reliably filtering out unsafe or extraneous requests. Happy tinkering, and best of luck with your system!",

Only accept requests the model is very confident about, and flag uncertain ones for human review.\n\n4. Use constrained generation techniques like guided decoding or regex filters to limit the model's output.\n\n5. Maintain an explicit allowlist of valid actions and entities. Have the model map requests to these predefined options.\n\n6. Implement fallback logic to handle edge cases, like asking for clarification on ambiguous requests.\n\n7. Consider a multi-model approach, using a smaller model for initial filtering and a larger one for more nuanced cases.\n\n8. Regularly update your training data and fine-tune the model based on real user interactions and edge cases encountered.\n\n9. Implement robust logging and monitoring to catch and analyze any false positives or negatives.\n\n10. Consider using a retrieval-augmented approach to ground the model's responses in a knowledge base of valid actions and policies.\n\nThe key is finding the right balance between flexibility and control.

Here are a few strategic approaches that might help break you out of that loop:\n\n## Core Strategy Considerations:\n\n**Intent vs. Action Separation**: Instead of trying to validate the exact request, consider having your gatekeeper focus purely on *intent classification* - is this a legitimate user trying to do something within scope? Then let the powerful model handle the nuanced interpretation.\n\n**Structured Output + Confidence Scoring**: Rather than a binary pass/fail, have the gatekeeper return structured data like `{intent: \"delete\", confidence: 0.85, scope: \"in_bounds\", reasoning: \"...\"}`. This gives you more control over the threshold.\n\n**Multi-Stage Validation**: Sometimes a two-step gatekeeper works better - first classify intent broadly, then validate specifics only for certain categories.\n\n## Prompt Architecture Ideas:\n\n- **Few-shot examples** that specifically show edge cases (colloquial language, multi-part requests)\n- **Explicit \"unknown\" category** to reduce hallucination pressure\n- **Chain-of-thought** reasoning to make the model show its work\n\nThe multi-request issue you mentioned (`\"create channel and tell joke\"`) is particularly interesting - you might want the gatekeeper to *decompose* requests and validate each part separately.\n\nI've worked through similar guardrail challenges in production systems, particularly around the strict vs. flexible balance.

Two-stage validation approach:**\n- First pass: Extract and normalize the intent (handles colloquialisms)\n- Second pass: Validate the normalized intent against allowed actions\n- This separates \"understanding\" from \"validating\"\n\n**2. Explicit scope boundaries in the prompt:**\n- Instead of \"validate if this is allowed\", try \"extract ONLY actions related to [specific domain]\"\n- Include examples of multi-intent requests and how to handle them\n- Be explicit about ignoring out-of-scope content rather than rejecting the whole request\n\n**3. Structured output format:**\n- Force the gatekeeper to output in a specific schema (like JSON)\n- Include fields for: primary_action, is_valid, confidence_score, ignored_content\n- This prevents hallucination and makes the model more deterministic\n\n**4. Few-shot examples that cover edge cases:**\n- Include examples of colloquial language → formal intent\n- Show how to handle compound requests\n- Demonstrate partial validation (valid action + invalid action)\n\n**5. Consider a hybrid approach:**\n- Use regex/keyword matching for common colloquialisms as a pre-filter\n- This reduces the ambiguity the LLM needs to handle\n\nThe key insight I've found is that trying to make one prompt do everything (understand, normalize, AND validate) often leads to the loop you're experiencing. Breaking it into discrete steps usually gives much better results.\n\nHappy to discuss specific prompt patterns or architecture decisions if you want to dive deeper!",

Your summary is spot-on: Too strict, and you block legitimate-but-colloquial or creative requests; too loose, and you risk letting through unsafe or unsupported actions. Here are some thoughts and strategies, as well as a \"joke\" about the process at the end:\n\n**1. Prompt Engineering Approaches**\n\n- **Instruction layering**: Instead of a binary \"accept/reject,\" ask the LLM to (a) restate the user's intent in structured form, (b) classify whether it's in-scope/out-of-scope, and (c) explain its reasoning. This gives you more context to make a decision programmatically.\n- **Examples, examples, examples**: In your prompt, include positive and negative examples, especially edge cases and \"jokes.\" LLMs love a good list of \"do/don't\" samples.\n- **Self-critique**: Ask the LLM to \"double-check\" itself or provide a confidence score. Sometimes, \"On a scale from 1-10, how certain are you this is a valid request?\" helps catch hallucinations.\n- **Multiple passes**: Chain two models (or two calls): first, to extract/normalize intent; second, to validate. Sometimes splitting the task works better.\n\n**2. Guardrail-Adjacent Tools**\n\n- Consider using lightweight classifiers (zero/few-shot, or traditional ML) for filtering before/after the LLM.\n- Regex or rule-based pre-filter (for obvious out-of-scope terms) + LLM for more nuanced judgment.\n\n**3. Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) Fallback**\n\n- For ambiguous cases, ask the LLM to flag for HITL review or to respond with a clarifying question to the user.\n\n**4. Metrics and Iteration**\n\n- Log \"false positives\" and \"false negatives\" to quickly iterate your prompt or add more/better examples.\n- Periodically review edge cases with your team.\n\n**5. \"Joke\" as Promised:**\n\nWhy did the gatekeeping LLM refuse to open the channel?\n\nBecause it didn't want to let in any \"unstructured\" guests — they might cause a prompt party!\n\n**TL;DR:** There's no \"just right\" prompt — you'll always be tuning for your specific distribution of user input. Consider layering prompt instructions, providing lots of edge-case examples, and accepting that a certain level of human review or error-handling is necessary for robust safety.\n\nIf you want to share your current prompt and some tricky examples, happy to brainstorm more concretely!",

          "response": "Here are a few thoughts and approaches you might consider, based on experiences I’ve had (and seen others have) building “gatekeeper”-style systems to validate requests before they’re passed on to a more powerful or more expensive model. I’ll break this into higher-level ideas and more tactical tips:\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n1) Clearly Separate Classification from “Reasoning”\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n• Hybrid Approach – Treat request-validation as largely a classification or detection problem (e.g., “Is this likely disallowed or out-of-scope?”). Don’t ask the model to do any heavy reasoning in this step. Instead:\n  – Use a smaller or simpler model (or a dedicated classification pipeline) to filter or label the request.\n  – Only when it passes that filter does it go to your more capable “main” model or agent.\n• Why it helps – If the logic is purely “check a set of well-defined constraints,” a simpler model or even a rule-based system might be more consistent than a large model that tries to “infer intent.” LLMs can be too creative or “hallucinate” reasons to deny or allow. \n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n2) Make the Prompt (or Rules) as Concrete as Possible\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n• Common Pitfall – If the “gatekeeper” prompt says “Reject any disallowed content,” but doesn’t specify what “disallowed” means, or if the instructions are too vague, the model might over-reject or under-reject. \n• Consider More Fine-Grained Criteria – For example:\n  – “Reject any request that violates these policy categories: [list categories with examples: adult content, hate speech, etc.].”\n  – “Reject any request that includes personal data beyond the user’s own personal data” (if that’s your policy).\n  – “Reject any request that includes attempts to do X, Y, Z specifically.”\n• Provide Examples – Show the model labeled examples of both allowed and disallowed requests, especially edge cases, so it’s not left guessing how to interpret colloquial or ambiguous user language. \n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n3) Layered Prompts or “Bouncer → Brain” Flow\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n• Stage 1: Bouncer – This stage sees the user’s raw request and runs a narrow check: “Does this request appear valid? Does it meet minimal quality or safety thresholds?” The instructions here are brief and specific.  \n• Stage 2: Brain – If the result from Stage 1 is “Allowed,” pass the original request to the more powerful language model. This second stage can handle nuance, question answering, creative writing, etc. \n• Why this Helps – By limiting the scope of the “bouncer,” you can keep it from overthinking, hallucinating, or mixing up user-intent detection with more extensive generative capabilities. \n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n4) Consider Using a Structured Checklist\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n• Instead of a single open-ended prompt, ask the gatekeeper model to fill out a short form (like a JSON checklist). For example:\n  {\n    \"request_type\": \"...\",\n    \"is_disallowed_content\": yes/no,\n    \"why\": \"...\",\n    \"action\": \"approve\" or \"reject\"\n  }\n• Rationale – This can reduce creative/hallucinatory text and keep the model grounded in the categories or checks you care about (combativeness, personal data, out-of-scope tasks, suspicious requests, etc.).\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n5) Carefully Handle Edge Cases and Colloquial Variations\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n• Must Have: Clear definitions for “edge” requests that are borderline. If the user says “tell me a dirty joke,” is that disallowed or not? \n• Provide Realistic Examples – If your policy is that mild adult humor is allowed, while hateful or extremely graphic content is not, the gatekeeper prompt or classification pipeline needs examples like:\n  – Allowed: “Tell me a silly joke about cats,” “Tell me a slightly off-color joke about coffee.”\n  – Disallowed: “Tell me a hateful joke that insults a protected group.”\n• Emphasize these examples so the model sees how to interpret casual or slang language—otherwise it might over-index on the word “dirty” and reject everything.\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n6) Tune the “Strictness Dial”\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n• Rule of Thumb – If your gatekeeper is too strict, you’ll frustrate users with false positives (valid requests get rejected). If it’s too lax, you’ll let through requests you don’t want to pass on. \n• Iterative Refinement – Start with stricter policies, then examine false positives. If you see the gatekeeper is rejecting harmless requests, revise your instructions with clarifications or examples. \n• Data Feedback Loop – Keep logs (with safety in mind) and let humans review borderline rejections or approvals so you can refine.\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n7) Consider a Multi-Model Ensemble\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n• One Model for Intent or Category Detection – For instance, fine-tune or prompt a smaller model on a classification dataset of request types: Q&A, jokes, adult content, self-harm queries, etc.  \n• Another Model for Safety/Compliance – A second model (or the same model with a different set of instructions) checks the user’s text for disallowed keywords, self-harm triggers, hateful or violent content, etc. \n• Combine Results – If either classifier marks the request as disallowed, your system rejects or escalates for human review. If they both pass, it goes on to the “main” LLM.\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n8) Beware of “Polite Hallucinations”\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n• Tendency of Large Models – They might say something like “I must refuse because your request is disallowed,” even if the request is actually valid. This can come from prompts that overemphasize safety without enough nuance. \n• Mitigation – Use real, concrete policy rules, including allowed topics. Encourage the gatekeeper to reference the policy directly, e.g., “Based on the policy categories, I see no violation, so I will approve.” \n• Debugging – If you see constant over-rejections, you may need to reduce the “fear factor” by clarifying that not all borderline language is disallowed—only explicit or clearly out-of-policy content.\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n9) Wrap the Gatekeeper in Logging / Monitoring\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n• Why – The best guardrails are still prone to corner cases or policy drift. You want to continually see how many requests get flagged incorrectly, and adapt. \n• Human-in-the-loop for Hard Cases – Especially early in development, consider requiring a secondary review if the classification confidence is below a certain threshold. \n• Collect Real-World Examples – Over time, add them back into your training set or your prompt examples to strengthen the system.\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n10) Keep the Gatekeeper’s “Job” Simple\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n• Resist Overloading – It’s tempting to have a single prompt do everything: interpret user intent, figure out disallowed requests, re-route to different endpoints, etc. That can get messy. \n• Single Focus – If possible, keep the gatekeeper’s job basically: “Read the policy, see if this request violates it; if not, pass it on. If uncertain, ask for a manual check.” \n• Complexity Usually Belongs Later – Let the main agent handle advanced reasoning once it’s already deemed safe to do so.\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n\nIn short, the more you can make the gatekeeper’s prompt or classification step concrete, rule-based, and example-driven, the more consistent it’ll be. If you notice the model “hallucinating” rejections or approvals, look closely at whether your policy or prompt is ambiguous, or if you’re asking too much of that model (like combining classification and creative tasks).\n\nHope this helps spark some ideas! It’s definitely an iterative process—collecting real examples of borderline inputs, clarifying your categories, and refining so you get a sweet spot between “too strict” and “too permissive.” If you have specific scenarios or policy categories you’re grappling with, feel free to share more details—sometimes the devil is in very specific definitions.

          "response": "Great question—this is a classic \"guardrail\" challenge and super relevant right now!\n\nSome general framing and strategies, based on experience building LLM filters and agents:\n\n**1. Embrace Iterative Layering Rather Than a Single Prompt**\n- Instead of a single prompt doing all the filtering, consider a two-step or layered approach:\n  - **Step 1:** Normalize or clarify intent (e.g., \"What is the user's core action request?\")\n  - **Step 2:** Validate if that request is in-scope, allowed, well-formed, etc.\n- This reduces the cognitive load on the LLM and helps with both strictness and flexibility.\n\n**2. Prompt as an Intent Extractor, Not a Judge**\n- Reframe the prompt so the LLM is first asked to extract/condense the user’s intent into a canonical action (e.g., `\"delete channel\"`).\n- Then, a simple rule or another LLM call can judge if the action is valid.\n- This approach makes colloquial or noisy input less likely to be rejected just for phrasing.\n\n**3. Be Explicit in Prompt Scope**\n- Instruct the LLM to only consider certain actions and to ignore or flag \"out of scope\" sub-requests (e.g., jokes, unrelated queries). E.g., \"Only consider requests about channel management. Ignore or reject any secondary requests.\"\n- Provide clear positive/negative examples.\n\n**4. Provide Diverse, Edge-Case Examples**\n- In-context learning works best when your prompt includes both:\n  - Direct, formal requests (\"Delete channel\")\n  - Colloquial variations (\"kinda delete this channel\", \"can you get rid of this?\", etc.)\n  - Multi-intent or ambiguous requests (\"create a channel and tell me a joke\")\n- Show not just what to accept, but what to reject and how to label them.\n\n**5. Consider Outputting a Structured Response**\n- Rather than yes/no, ask the LLM to return something like:\n  ```json\n  {\n    \"intent\": \"delete_channel\",\n    \"valid\": true,\n    \"notes\": \"Colloquial phrasing\"\n  }\n  ```\n  Or, for out-of-scope:\n  ```json\n  {\n    \"intent\": null,\n    \"valid\": false,\n    \"notes\": \"Contains multiple unrelated requests\"\n  }\n  ```\n- This can make downstream automation/decision logic more reliable.\n\n**6. Tune for Your Actual Data**\n- Collect real user examples, including messy/colloquial input, and tune/test on those. Prompts always need iterative refinement!\n\n**Summary:**\n- Separate intent extraction from validation.\n- Be explicit about scope and provide diverse examples.\n- Use structured outputs if possible.\n\nHappy to discuss more or wade through specific scenarios—feel free to DM if you want to go deeper!\n\n---\n\n**Related Reading:**\n- [OpenAI Cookbook: Building Guardrails](https://cookbook.openai.com/examples/structured_output)\n- [Anthropic’s Constitutional AI (for prompt design inspiration)](https://www.anthropic.com/constitutional-ai)\n- [\"Ask, Extract, Validate\" prompting pattern (blog)](https://www.promptingguide.ai/techniques/chain-of-thought)\n\nLet me know if you want to dig in!",

          "response": "Hey, I’ve definitely experimented with “gatekeeper” patterns before—both for protecting more expensive models and for ensuring they only see the right kinds of prompts. It’s a tricky balance because there’s always a tension between strictness (rejecting polite but informal or ambiguous requests) and flexibility (risking hallucinations, over-interpretations, or expansions beyond the scope). \n\nA few high-level strategies and considerations that might help:\n\n1. Make the Gatekeeper’s Job Narrow and Explicit:\n   • Instead of trying to cover all possible interpretations, try focusing the gatekeeper’s role on a single, well-defined question—for example: “Does this request fall within one of our known valid action categories (like create, delete, etc.)?”  \n   • If there’s any ambiguity about user intent (“kinda delete this channel” vs. “delete this channel”), have the gatekeeper ask clarifying questions or produce a standardized “Yes/No” with a short reason. This keeps the gatekeeper in a well-defined lane.\n\n2. Use a Structured or “Canonical” Form:\n   • You can prompt the gatekeeper to rewrite any valid user command into a canonical form—e.g., “delete channel” if it recognized “kinda delete this channel” as a valid directive.  \n   • If part of the request is out of scope (“create a channel and tell me a joke”), consider having your gatekeeper split the request into recognized commands plus a leftover. Then it can confidently pass along the recognized command, while ignoring or flagging the part that doesn’t match known actions.\n\n3. Iterate on Real-World Examples:\n   • It’s often impossible to predict all corner cases. Feed your gatekeeper prompt with actual user queries you’ve seen out in the wild—especially borderline ones—and carefully tune how the gatekeeper handles them. \n   • Keep track of false positives (valid commands that get blocked) vs. false negatives (things that slip through when they shouldn’t). Adjust your instructions or add clarifying examples.\n\n4. Provide Clear “When in Doubt, Ask” Guidance:\n   • Sometimes the best approach is to let the gatekeeper ask for clarification if it can’t confidently decide. That might be a separate short response: “Could you clarify if you want to delete the channel?”  \n   • This ensures you’re not missing valid requests due to overly rigid prompting.\n\n5. Consider a Lightweight Classifier Before the LLM:\n   • Depending on your system, you might even put a small classification model (something cheaper than an LLM) in front of the gatekeeper to handle basic route-or-block decisions (like coarse filtering). Then the gatekeeper LLM only does the finer-grained “did the user actually mean X or Y?”  \n   • This helps reduce load on the more powerful or more expensive models and keeps the prompt design simpler.\n\n6. Keep the Gatekeeper’s Output as “Just Enough”:\n   • If the gatekeeper tries to do too much reasoning, it might hallucinate. Prompt it to do exactly what you need—no more, no less.  \n   • Often, that means “classify into X action or Y action or reject,” or “rewrite the request in a normalized form, or else ask for clarification.”\n\nUltimately, it’s an iterative process. You’ll find the sweet spot by testing against a real set of user queries and seeing where it breaks. Good luck with building out your system—feel free to DM if you have more nuanced questions!",

          "response": "This is a fascinating problem that many are grappling with when building systems around LLMs. One idea to explore is breaking down the filtering process into multiple stages rather than trying to squeeze all interpretive nuance into a single prompt. Here are some strategies and angles you might consider:\n\n1. Layered Evaluation:  \n • Instead of one prompt trying to both classify intent and detect forbidden actions, consider a multi-step process. For example, first ask the LLM to paraphrase or decompose the request into a more structured, canonical intent and parameters. In a subsequent step, verify that the canonical intent is allowed. This separation can help mitigate the risk of overgeneralizing or conflating allowed and disallowed aspects.  \n • If a request like “kinda delete this channel” comes in, the first stage could normalize the intent to “delete channel,” which is then validated more robustly.\n\n2. Explicit Instruction on Priorities:  \n • In your instructions, clearly define that the primary task is to extract the core intent(s) and flag any extraneous directives. For example, instruct the model to first extract and validate the main request (for example, “delete channel”), and then list any secondary requests (like “tell me a joke”) as annotations that do not affect the validation outcome.  \n • This sort of hierarchy in instructions can help the filter prioritize and ignore embellishments that might normally lead to hallucinations.\n\n3. Use of Examples and Edge Cases:  \n • When constructing your prompt, include several examples that illustrate borderline cases—both acceptable colloquial phrasing and requests that combine allowed and disallowed actions.  \n • These examples “teach” the model what to do in ambiguous cases: for instance, treating “kinda delete this channel” as a valid paraphrasing of a delete command, while ignoring or explicitly flagging secondary parts that fall outside the allowed scope.\n\n4. Constrained and Structured Output Formats:  \n • Another promising strategy is to require the model to output its answer in a well-defined format, such as a JSON with keys like “main_command”, “parameters”, and “extraneous_requests”.  \n • This structuring forces the model to isolate its interpretation and allows downstream components to decide how to handle any extra parts (like jokes or comments).  \n • Although you mentioned you’re not looking for code, designing the output format at a conceptual level can be very helpful for guiding the model’s behavior.\n\n5. Fall-back Safe Modes:  \n • If the filter is not 100% sure (for example, if the input contains multiple conflicting or ambiguous instructions), it might be safer to have it flag the input for human review or simply refuse to process it rather than passing it to the expensive model.  \n • The prompt can include a “confidence threshold” instruction: if the model cannot confidently pinpoint a single valid intent within the allowed set, it should just output a “can’t determine” flag.\n\n6. Hybrid Approaches (LLM plus Rule-Based):  \n • It might be worth considering a hybrid scheme. Let the LLM do the natural language understanding first, and then have a lightweight rule-based filter inspect the LLM’s synthesized output.  \n • For instance, after parsing, you could have a checklist: does the extracted command match a list of approved actions? If not, even if the LLM is trying to “explain” or “joke,” the gatekeeper can enforce strict boundaries based on pre-determined rules.\n\n7. Iterative Tuning and Red Teaming:  \n • Lastly, no matter how thoughtful your design is, keep iterating. Set up a red-teaming process where you intentionally try to construct inputs that might confuse the system.  \n • Collect these edge cases and use them to continuously improve both your examples and prompt instructions.\n\nFinding the right balance will likely require both experimentation in prompt engineering and a good understanding of the anticipated user language variations. The trade-off between flexibility and precision is tricky, but by decomposing tasks, prioritizing intents, and clearly defining output formats, you stand a much better chance of mitigating hallucinations while still capturing valid, colloquial requests.  \n\nIt sounds like you’re on the right track by exploring these nuanced approaches. Good luck with your project, and it would be fascinating to hear how you eventually balance these aspects in practice!",

Reject Ambiguity:\nIf you want safety, include in your prompt that if the request is ambiguous, multi-intent (“and tell me a joke”), or includes unrecognized actions, it should be rejected or flagged for review.\n\n4. Allow Minor Typos & Colloquialisms:\nExplicitly instruct the LLM to tolerate minor typos and colloquial phrases as long as the intent is clear and still matches an allowed action. Example: “If the request contains minor spelling errors or casual language but the intent is clear and matches an allowed action, accept it.”\n\n5. Catch-All “Out of Scope” Clause:\nHave the prompt specify: “If any part of the request does not correspond to a supported action, or if the user asks for multiple unrelated things, reject the entire request.”\n\n6. Use Output Formatting:\nAsk the LLM to respond with a simple Accept/Reject and a short explanation. This makes auditing easier and helps spot systematic errors in filtering.\n\n7. Iterative Prompt Refinement:\nKeep a log of false positives/negatives and iteratively update your prompt with new edge cases. Sometimes, “few-shot” prompting with additional tricky examples is enough to nudge performance in the right direction.\n\n8. Consider Model Choice:\nIf you’re using a small/cheap LLM as gatekeeper, test a few options. Some smaller models overfit on prompt wording; others are better at generalizing.\n\n9. Layered Filtering:\nSometimes, combining a simple rules-based filter (for obvious invalid patterns) before the LLM can help offload trivial cases and let the LLM focus on borderline ones.\n\nYou’re definitely on the right track — this is an “art and science” problem! If you want to brainstorm specific prompt snippets or discuss tradeoffs, happy to chat further.\n\nGood luck! This is a tricky but super interesting area.",

          "response": "It’s definitely a tricky balance to strike. Here are a few strategies people often use:\n\n1. Structured Input and Preprocessing  \n   • Instead of sending raw, free-form text to your gatekeeper, consider some lightweight preprocessing of the user request. Even something as simple as a short classification step (is this request in-scope or out-of-scope, is it nonsensical or ill-formed) can help you steer the gatekeeper more reliably.  \n   • Another option is keeping a short list of permissible “actions” or “intents” and ensuring the gatekeeper’s job is primarily to match the user’s language to one of these known actions. It reduces the chance of the model “hallucinating” odd expansions.  \n\n2. Contextual Guidance (System / Developer Prompts)  \n   • Make clear at a “system” or “developer” level what the gatekeeper should do. For instance, “You are a gatekeeper that only validates if the user’s request is legitimate within these instructions. Do not attempt to handle unrelated tasks or provide additional content.”  \n   • Provide examples of borderline user inputs that are still valid, and show how you’d like them categorized. This often helps the model parse casual language (“kinda” / “sorta”) for an intended, valid request.  \n\n3. Layered Approach  \n   • If possible, have an initial filter that quickly discards truly out-of-scope or harmful requests (e.g., extremely toxic language, requests for disallowed data).  \n   • Then, use your gatekeeper LLM to parse the user’s intent more precisely. If it’s “kinda delete,” the gatekeeper should interpret that as “delete.” If the user lumps together multiple requests (“create a channel and tell me a joke”), the gatekeeper should forward only the permissible part to the next step or instruct the user to separate the requests.  \n   • This two-tier approach means you’re not pushing the heavier model to handle every possible user query; you’re just ensuring the gatekeeper doesn’t attempt to handle out-of-scope tasks on its own.  \n\n4. Careful Prompt Tuning and Testing  \n   • Consider a more neutral stance in your prompt, rather than “strict vs. flexible.” You might highlight that the gatekeeper should be “inclusive of minor variations in phrasing but exclusive of requests outside the following scope…”  \n   • Curate a test set of typical queries, borderline cases, and out-of-scope examples. Repeatedly refine your prompt by seeing how the gatekeeper handles each sample.  \n   • Whenever something goes wrong (e.g., it erroneously blocks a valid colloquial phrase), incorporate that example—and how you wanted it to behave—directly into your prompt examples.\n\n5. Clear Explanation on Rejection/Clarification  \n   • When the gatekeeper rejects something or can’t parse a request, it should ask the user for clarification rather than just shutting the request down. This helps the user reframe their request in a more acceptable format.  \n   • Using a short fallback message like “I didn’t quite understand that. Could you be more specific about what you want to do?” helps ensure you’re not losing valid requests that happen to be phrased oddly.\n\nBy iterating on these steps—choosing or blending them to fit your domain—most teams eventually land on a gatekeeper that’s neither too rigid nor too permissive.

          "response": "You're not alone in running into this balancing act. It can be really tricky to design a prompt that both catches the intended user action—even if it's expressed in a colloquial or quirky way—while not overreaching and trying to process parts of a request that it's not meant to handle.\n\nHere are a few ideas that might help as you iterate on your guardrail approach:\n\n1. Two-Tier / Cascading Filters:  \n • Consider splitting the task into two stages. The first stage is a lightweight classifier/extractor that checks if the input mentions a valid command (without trying to process extraneous parts). The second stage could be a more robust interpretation mechanism activated only when the command is clearly valid.  \n • This allows the first pass to prioritize recall (catching valid intents even in messy language) while the second pass can be more precise about handling details.\n\n2. Instruction Chaining and Clarification:  \n • Instead of expecting a single-step response that both validates and interprets the request, prompt the LLM in two steps. For example, first instruct it to extract only the portion indicating a command (with allowances for variations like “kinda delete…”) without getting sidetracked by additional content. Then, in a follow-up, have it confirm that the extracted intent falls into an approved set of actions.  \n • This “chain-of-thought” style can reduce the risk of hallucinating commands from out-of-scope fragments.\n\n3. Using Examples and Counterexamples:  \n • Provide the model with a handful of examples that illustrate both acceptable flexible language and borderline cases where content should be ignored.  \n • Explicitly note that if the input contains additional unrelated instructions (like “tell me a joke”) that do not affect the main command, they should be omitted from the validation process.\n\n4. Strict Scoping Instructions:  \n • Include instructions that force the model to “restrict its attention only to the part of the text that clearly represents the primary intent.”  \n • For instance, you can instruct the model: “Identify the primary actionable command in this text. Ignore any extraneous or ambiguous language.”  \n • That can help it avoid processing typos or secondary requests that aren’t within the defined scope.\n\n5. Iterative Refinement and Evaluation:  \n • Given that language is inherently variable, it might be worth setting up an iterative testing process where you feed a variety of example inputs (both ideal, borderline, and intentionally tricky cases) to see how your prompt performs.  \n • Monitor for both false negatives (legitimate commands being rejected) and false positives (invalid or out-of-scope content being processed), then adjust the prompt accordingly.\n\n6. Feedback Mechanisms:  \n • One thing that might help is building a feedback loop. If the gatekeeper model is unsure (or flags an ambiguous request), it could ask for clarification instead of directly passing on a potentially malformed request.  \n • This additional layer can mitigate risks if there’s any uncertainty about the user’s intent.\n\nUltimately, finding that sweet spot will likely require a mix of prompt tuning, carefully chosen examples, and perhaps a minor architecture tweak to handle ambiguity via a clarification step. The key is to compartmentalize the tasks: first, reliably validating the command, and then, in a separate step, interpreting its details. This modular approach can help prevent the gatekeeper from “overreaching” its intended scope.\n\nHope these strategies give you some useful ideas as you refine your system!",

Define “Valid” as a Spectrum, Not a Binary:**  \nRather than a strict yes/no, consider asking the gatekeeper to assign a confidence score or categorize the request (e.g., “definitely valid,” “ambiguous,” “invalid”). This gives you a chance to route ambiguous cases to a fallback process (like a stricter rule or a human review), which can help balance precision and recall.\n\n**2. Provide Diverse, Realistic Examples in the Prompt:**  \nYour few-shot examples should include both perfectly phrased requests and messy, colloquial, or “edge case” user inputs. This teaches the model the boundaries you want, and what “almost valid” looks like.\n\n**3. Explicitly Instruct on Handling Multiple Actions:**  \nIf requests with multiple actions are out of scope, make that crystal clear—e.g., “If the user asks for more than one action, respond: ‘Invalid request: multiple actions detected’.”\n\n**4. Use Step-by-Step Reasoning in the Prompt:**  \nEncourage the model to think through the request: “First, identify the main action requested. Second, determine if the action is within scope. Third, check for ambiguity or multiple actions.” This can really cut down on hallucinations and misclassifications.\n\n**5. Tune for Your Actual Users:**  \nIf possible, collect logs of real user queries (anonymized) and analyze where the current prompt fails. Prompt iteration is much easier with actual data—sometimes the main challenge is handling the top 5 weird user phrasings.\n\n**6. Accept Some Ambiguity and Escalate:**  \nIt’s OK if a small percentage of requests are “unsure”—you can have the gatekeeper output “Can’t tell, escalate to main model” in these cases, rather than risking false positives/negatives.\n\n**7. Don’t Overcomplicate the Gatekeeper:**  \nRemember, the main model is there for a reason. The goal is to cheaply filter the clear-cut cases; perfection isn’t necessary at this stage. Use the gatekeeper to reduce load, not to replace nuanced understanding entirely.\n\nIf you want to discuss specific strategies, edge cases, or hear more detailed stories from similar projects, happy to chat further!\n\nBest of luck—sounds like a fun problem to solve.",

          "success": false,
          "response": "Here are a few strategic angles you might consider, based on patterns I’ve seen when designing “gatekeeper” prompts:\n\n1. Dual-Phase Validation  \n   • First pass: Have the gatekeeper run a quick, high-level check—strictly for domain/out-of-scope issues. This is intentionally narrow (e.g., “Is the user asking for something obviously disallowed, or is it definitely not in the domain of our service?”). The goal is to avoid false rejections on minor wording quirks.  \n   • Second pass: If the request is still ambiguous or borderline, the gatekeeper does a brief re-interpretation—e.g., “User says ‘kinda delete.’ Are they truly asking for a delete action? Or is it an unrelated question about deletions?” This second pass can help you not to reject valid but imprecise commands.\n\n2. Layered Prompting Instead of One Big Prompt  \n   • Rather than trying to encode every single condition or nuance in a single prompt, break it up into sub-prompts. For instance:  \n     1) Evaluate if user’s request is in scope and safe.  \n     2) If yes, pass along the request with a standard cleaned-up form (e.g., “delete channel”).  \n     3) If no, return a reason for refusing.  \n   • This approach can reduce hallucination because each sub-prompt has a very clear, single objective.\n\n3. Include “Common Misinterpretations” Examples  \n   • In your prompt instructions, provide short “misinterpretation” samples. For instance:  \n     “If the user says ‘maybe remove user’ but obviously wants to ban a user, do not reject; interpret it as ban/remove.”  \n     “If the user says ‘Generate a channel and tell me a joke,’ do not conflate the two requests. Focus on the channel creation part only.”  \n   • This can help guide the model that “colloquial” or “extra” statements shouldn’t overshadow the primary actionable part.\n\n4. Encourage a Brief “Rewriting” or “Normalization” Step  \n   • Ask the model to restate the user’s request verbatim or in simpler terms—almost like an intermediate summary. E.g., “Your job is to interpret ambiguous or colloquial language into a standard instruction. If the standard instruction is not valid, then reject.”  \n   • By forcing that formal restatement as part of the gatekeeper process, you nudge the model to separate the user’s request from additional chatter.\n\n5. Confidence-Based or Heuristic Checks  \n   • Sometimes you have to accept that no single prompt can cover every weird user phrasing. Introduce a fallback: if the gatekeeper is “uncertain” but not fully rejecting, you can either escalate to a human check or produce a clarifying question.  \n   • For example, if the user says something borderline, prompt the model to respond with something like, “I need more clarity on your request. Did you mean to create or delete the channel?” This can reduce overzealous rejects.\n\n6. Fine-Tuning or Instruction Tuning (If Resources Allow)  \n   • If you have the capacity, training a small, specialized model (or at least performing instruction tuning) on examples of user queries—both valid and invalid—can drastically reduce mistakes.  \n   • Even a small curated dataset of “requests” plus “correct gatekeeper decisions” helps the model learn your specific boundaries more reliably than a big, generic prompt.\n\n7. Iterative Prompt Debugging with Real Inputs  \n   • Finally, the tried-and-true method: take user logs (or as close to real-world data as possible) and test them against your gatekeeper’s prompt. Note the false positives (legitimate requests the model wrongly rejects) and false negatives (requests it lets through but shouldn’t), then revise. This feedback loop is typically ongoing—you tweak the prompt as new edge cases are discovered.\n\nHope at least a couple of these approaches resonate. Good luck tuning your gatekeeper!

          "response": "You've nailed a common predicament with layered LLM systems: ensuring your guardrail is both nuanced enough to understand natural language (even when it's informal) while staying strict enough to not drift into extraneous domains.\n\nHere are some ideas and strategies to consider:\n\n1. Two-Phase Processing:  \n • Instead of trying to solve both “understand intent” and “validate scope” in one shot, split the task into two passes. First, have a lightweight model extract or rephrase user intent into a canonical, normalized command. Next, have a second phase where you validate that normalized command against allowed actions.  \n • This clarifies the job: the first phase tackles the “translation” of colloquial language, and the second insists on tight boundaries.\n\n2. Chain of Thought / Self-Reflection:  \n • Encourage the gatekeeper LLM to break down the user input step-by-step. For instance, “Identify the primary action requested, ignore any additional qualifiers or creative add-ons, and then verify if the action is allowed.”  \n • This can help avoid hallucinating details or handling out-of-scope requests, as the model is directed to explain its reasoning internally before producing a judgment.\n\n3. Few-shot Examples and Edge Cases:  \n • Providing examples that cover borderline cases (like “kinda delete this channel” or requests with mixed intents) can help the LLM learn the desired balance.  \n • Showing examples where extraneous portions should be stripped or ignored teaches the model the subtle difference between colloquial language and actionable intent.\n\n4. Explicit Directives to Disregard Extraneous Requests:  \n • In your prompt, be explicit that if a user pairs a valid command with any additional commands (e.g., “do this and then make me laugh”), the filter should only process the valid aspect or, if the additional request is completely out-of-scope, reject or ignore it.  \n • You might instruct the model: “Focus solely on [allowed actions list]. If any part of the input falls outside this scope, do not attempt to process or validate it.”\n\n5. Tolerance for Ambiguity with Clarification:  \n • It’s sometimes better for your gatekeeper to respond with a clarifying question or to flag uncertain inputs rather than outright rejecting them.  \n • While that might introduce another layer of interaction, it could help in borderline “colloquial” cases. Alternatively, setting a threshold for confidence (if your model outputs a confidence metric) could determine whether to pass the query through or ask for clarification.\n\n6. Iterative Testing and Tuning:  \n • As many have experienced with LLM agents, the process is iterative. Collect input examples that the system misclassifies, analyze them, and adjust your prompt.  \n • Sometimes subtle changes in wording or adding a short “reasoning” section in the prompt (like “Step 1: Identify core command. Step 2: Validate against allowed list”) can make a significant difference.\n\nIn essence, there’s no one-size-fits-all answer, but combining a layered approach with explicit instructions and illustrative examples can provide that balance you’re aiming for. The key is using the gatekeeper as more of an intelligent translator of user intent rather than a strict validator that might miss the forest for the trees. \n\nI hope these suggestions spark some ideas in your design.

You're essentially trying to balance between:\n\n1. **Precision** (strict prompts, clear rules, but risk false negatives on valid colloquial input)  \n2. **Recall** (more flexible prompts, capturing colloquial intent but risking false positives and hallucinations).\n\nSome quick strategic thoughts that helped me in similar settings:\n\n### 1. **Two-step Intent Extraction**\n- First, just classify the intent (e.g., \"Delete Channel\" vs \"Create Channel\" vs \"Other\").\n- Separately handle validation (\"Is this intent allowed?\") only if the intent classification is clear enough. This two-stage prompt can reduce hallucinations significantly as the LLM doesn't have to do both simultaneously.\n\n### 2. **Few-shot Prompting with Colloquial Examples**\n- Explicitly add colloquial examples (\"kinda delete this channel,\" \"can u pls remove this?\") to your few-shot prompt examples.\n- Conversely, add negative examples explicitly, e.g., \"Make a channel and tell me a joke\" → \"Out-of-scope; mixed request.\"\n\n### 3. **Chain-of-Thought (CoT) Prompting**\n- Have the model explicitly explain its reasoning briefly before giving a verdict. This often reduces hallucinations.\n- Example: \"First, classify the user's intention clearly. Then, briefly evaluate whether this action is within scope. Finally, output 'allowed' or 'disallowed'.\"\n\n### 4. **Structured Output Format**\n- Forcing structured output (JSON, YAML, or simple tags) can reduce ambiguity and hallucinations.  \n  Example:\n  ```\n  {\n    \"intent\": \"delete_channel\",\n    \"confidence\": 0.85,\n    \"allowed\": true,\n    \"reason\": \"User explicitly asked to delete channel, despite colloquial phrasing.\"\n  }\n  ```\n\n### 5. **Semantic Guardrails**\n- You might consider using a small semantic classifier (inexpensive embedding-based model) for initial filtering before the LLM validation step. This can cheaply pre-screen clearly invalid or out-of-scope inputs.\n\n### 6. **Confidence Thresholds**\n- Rather than a binary allow/disallow, let the LLM output confidence levels, and set thresholds. Inputs with uncertain confidence can trigger a fallback step (human review, simpler follow-up prompt, etc.)\n\nI’m happy to chat further if this is along the lines of what you're looking for.

Explicit Action Mapping**\nRather than asking the LLM to validate in the abstract, give it a concrete list of allowed actions and ask it to map the user input to one of them or \"NONE\". This reduces hallucination significantly.\n\n**3. Confidence Scoring**\nAsk the gatekeeper to provide a confidence score. Route high-confidence matches through, send low-confidence ones to a fallback (either rejection with clarification or human review).\n\n**4. Few-Shot Examples**\nInclude examples of edge cases in your prompt:\n- Valid colloquial requests that should pass\n- Multi-intent requests showing how to handle them\n- Out-of-scope requests that should fail\n\n**5. Structured Output**\nForce the gatekeeper to output in a structured format (JSON) with specific fields like `primary_intent`, `secondary_intents`, `out_of_scope_elements`.

A few strategic thoughts to consider:\n\n1. **Layered Prompting/Parsing:**  \n   Instead of asking your gatekeeper LLM to do everything in one shot, try a stepwise approach:\n   - First, have it extract or rephrase the user intent in a normalized form.\n   - Then, validate the normalized intent against allowed actions.\n   This reduces ambiguity, as you're not asking the model to both understand and judge in a single pass.\n\n2. **Explicit Scope Definition:**  \n   Sometimes, models get confused when the prompt doesn't clearly define what is in-scope. Explicitly list supported actions at the start of the prompt and instruct the LLM to only consider those. For example:  \n   “Valid actions: create_channel, delete_channel. Only validate requests for these actions. Ignore and reject any unrelated requests.”\n   This helps the model resist hallucinating or validating out-of-scope requests.\n\n3. **Colloquial Language Handling:**  \n   You can add examples to your prompt showing how informal or ambiguous requests should be interpreted. Encourage the LLM to \"normalize\" informal language before validation.  \n   For example:  \n   - User: \"kinda delete this channel?\" → Normalized: \"delete channel\"\n   - User: \"maybe make a new channel?\" → Normalized: \"create channel\"\n   This teaches the model to be forgiving with phrasing, but strict with action mapping.\n\n4. **Reject Multiple Actions:**  \n   To avoid multi-action hallucinations (“create a channel and tell me a joke”), explicitly instruct the model to only validate single actions per request, and to reject or flag requests containing multiple distinct intents.\n\n5. **Fallback/Escalation:**  \n   For ambiguous cases, have the gatekeeper return “uncertain” and escalate to a more thorough (but more expensive) review, or ask the user to clarify their intent.\n\n6. **Regular Prompt Refinement:**  \n   Collect examples of edge cases your gatekeeper mishandles, and iteratively update your prompt with these as negative/positive examples. This “prompt tuning” is especially effective for these kinds of natural language filters.\n\n7. **Hybrid Approaches:**  \n   Consider combining the LLM gatekeeper with lightweight rule-based checks (e.g., regex for obvious out-of-scope patterns) to catch egregious issues before invoking the model.\n\n**Summary**:  \nThe sweet spot is usually a clear, example-driven prompt that asks for normalization and validation in two steps, with explicit scope and a fallback for ambiguity.\n\nIf you want to chat specifics or share your current prompt, happy to discuss further in DMs!

Often this looks like:\n\n• Constraining to a limited set of “intents.” For example, the gatekeeper only needs to detect which type of action the user wants (delete, create, rename, etc.), plus whether it’s definitely valid, definitely invalid, or ambiguous and needs clarification.  \n• Encouraging synonyms rather than literal commands. Teach the gatekeeper that “kinda delete,” “wipe,” etc. all map to the same “delete” intent, so it’s more resilient to user phrasing.  \n• Separating concerns. Instead of letting the gatekeeper handle “secondary” requests (like telling a joke), have it flag them as out‐of‐scope, or pass them to a separate route. That way it doesn't try to interpret or validate jokes.  \n• Using few‐shot examples that explicitly show borderline language. Include examples of colloquial requests for valid commands (so it learns to say “yes, that means delete”) and out‐of‐scope requests (so it learns to reject or separate them).  \n• Capturing ambiguities. If the user’s request is confusing—e.g., “Kinda delete the channel or maybe not”—the gatekeeper can respond with “Need to clarify” instead of outright rejecting or accepting.  \n\nIt’s always a balancing act, but typically, tighter constraints plus more careful examples reduce the chance of the gatekeeper going off the rails. Even if you still see edge cases, you can keep refining your example set—and your high‐level instructions—to inch closer to the sweet spot. By approaching it as “intent detection with a fallback,” as opposed to a wide‐open conversation model, you often get more reliable filtering with fewer surprises.",

          "response": "It sounds like you’re encountering the classic tension between precision and flexibility in natural language understanding for guardrails. Here are some thoughts and strategies that might help:\n\n1. Define clear sub-tasks upfront. One approach is to decompose the user request into component intents before deciding whether to pass it on. Instead of a binary “validate or not” pass, consider first having the LLM parse and identify the intended actions and then decide if each fits within allowed parameters. This way, a request like “kinda delete this channel” can get parsed as a delete action even though the phrasing is informal.\n\n2. Use iterative or cascading calls. One idea is to “soft” check the input with a less strict initial prompt that extracts intents, and then run those extracted intents through a second layer that confirms their validity. That separation can help you avoid having one prompt do all the work and reduce the risk of hallucinatory interpretations (like trying to process a joke in a “create a channel and tell me a joke” request).\n\n3. Make your prompt modular. Instead of a single prompt that tries to both match paraphrase variations and restrict out-of-scope actions, consider a modular chain-of-thought where you include guidelines that instruct the LLM to first think about the user’s intent and then map it into predefined categories or commands. This may help in capturing the nuances in colloquial contexts, while still keeping the second pass confined to the allowed operations.\n\n4. Include examples and edge cases. One effective strategy is to give both positive and negative examples in your prompt. For instance, demonstrate how a casual phrasing (e.g., “kinda delete this channel”) should be mapped to a delete intent, and how a request that includes extraneous operations (e.g., “create a channel and tell me a joke”) should only be processed for the permitted action (e.g., creating a channel) and ignore or flag the rest. Explicit examples can help the LLM internalize the boundaries you want to impose.\n\n5. Leverage a rejection or clarification mechanism. If any part of the request is ambiguous, design the guardrail so that it errs on the side of caution—either rejecting the request outright, or choosing to ask a clarifying question. This may add a bit of latency, but it can increase safety when the input straddles the line between allowed and disallowed requests.\n\n6. Use adaptive prompting. If possible, collect user data or feedback over time to see where the gatekeeper makes mistakes. You might then adjust your prompt or even consider a small fine-tuning on a curated dataset of borderline examples. Sometimes a “light tuning” step or dynamic follow-up can dramatically improve performance and reduce hallucinations.\n\n7. Consider semantic similarity detection. In some cases you might include a separate non-LLM based module to detect if a request is semantically similar to known valid intents. That “pre-check” can help guide the LLM’s interpretation, effectively anchoring its outputs.\n\n8. Test heavily on edge cases. It’s critical to simulate inputs that include the unexpected language or multi-part instructions and see how your system reacts. Incrementally refine until you find a balance where you catch most valid variations without letting through hazardous or out-of-scope actions.\n\nUltimately, there’s no one-size-fits-all answer. The key is to acknowledge that sometimes a single gatekeeper may not be enough. A multi-tiered, layered approach—where parsing, validation, and allowance are distinct steps—often leads to more robust filtering. It sounds like you’re already on the right path, and these strategies might help you break out of your loop. Good luck!",

Balancing flexibility and strictness is a common issue when building robust systems that rely on natural language processing. Here are a few suggestions that might help:\n\n1. **Hierarchical Validation**: Consider implementing a multi-stage validation process. The first stage could be a very strict, rule-based filter that checks for specific keywords, syntax, and basic validity. This could be followed by a more flexible, semantic-based validation that tries to understand the user's intent more deeply.\n\n2. **Context-Aware Validation**: Incorporate contextual information into your validation process. This could include things like the user's previous actions, the current state of the system, or domain-specific knowledge. This can help the gatekeeper LLM make more informed decisions about the validity and scope of the user's request.\n\n3. **Iterative Refinement**: Continuously monitor the performance of your gatekeeper LLM and gather feedback from users. Use this information to iteratively refine your prompting strategy, adjusting the balance between flexibility and strictness as needed.\n\n4. **Ensemble Approach**: Consider using an ensemble of different validation models, each with its own strengths and weaknesses. This can help you leverage the complementary capabilities of multiple approaches and improve the overall robustness of your system.\n\n5. **Leveraging Pre-trained Models**: Explore the use of pre-trained language models, such as GPT-3 or T5, as a starting point for your gatekeeper LLM. These models have been trained on vast amounts of data and can often provide a strong foundation for your specific use case.\n\n6. **Structured Data Validation**: Depending on the nature of your user requests, you might consider incorporating structured data validation in addition to the natural language processing. This can help ensure that the user's request conforms to the expected input format and schema.\n\n7. **Explainable AI**: Implement mechanisms that allow your gatekeeper LLM to provide explanations for its decisions. This can help users understand why their requests were accepted or rejected, which can in turn inform the iterative refinement of your prompting strategy.\n\nThe key is to continuously experiment, gather feedback, and adapt your approach to find the right balance for your specific use case.

Explicit Scoping in the Prompt**\n- Make the LLM aware of the precise set of valid actions and instruct it to strictly ignore or flag anything outside that scope. For example:  \n  *\"You are only allowed to process requests related to [A, B, C]. If a user requests anything outside this list, respond with 'Invalid request.'\"*\n- This helps the model avoid \"hallucinating\" permissions or attempting to parse unrelated requests.\n\n**2. Multi-Step Validation (Decomposition)**\n- First, instruct the LLM to extract the action(s) and their arguments, and only in a second step validate whether those actions are permitted.\n- This separation reduces the risk of both over-filtering and under-filtering, since the LLM isn't trying to do too much in one step.\n\n**3. Reject Ambiguity**\n- Tell the LLM to default to rejection if an intent cannot be unambiguously mapped to a single, in-scope action. For example:  \n  *\"Only approve requests if the intent and action are clear and match the allowed actions list. If not, reject.\"*\n\n**4. Include Examples (Few-Shot Prompting)**\n- Give the model a handful of positive and negative examples, including edge cases with colloquial speech or multi-intent requests. This can dramatically improve precision and recall.\n- Be sure to include problematic cases like \"delete this channel kinda\" and \"create a channel and tell me a joke\" and show the model the correct response.\n\n**5. Post-LLM Rule-Based Fallback**\n- Consider a lightweight rule-based check after the LLM. For example, if the model approved an action not in the allowed set, block it anyway. This adds a defense-in-depth layer.\n\n**6. Regular Red Teaming**\n- Consistently test with adversarial and creative phrasing. Human-in-the-loop evaluations help catch edge cases the model misses.\n\n**7. Logging and Auditing**\n- Always log both accepted and rejected requests for further analysis, so you can iteratively improve your prompt and filtering strategy.\n\n**Summary**\nThe key is to combine explicit scoping, careful prompt engineering (with examples), ambiguity rejection, and layered defenses. No prompt is perfect, so plan for monitoring and continuous improvement.\n\nHappy to chat further or brainstorm edge cases if you want to DM.

          "response": "It can help to think of designing a “gatekeeper prompt” in layers, each layer clarifying what you want the LLM to do and what you don’t:\n\n1) Give the gatekeeper a clear “purpose statement.”  \n   – Why does it exist, and what does “validate this request” actually mean in practical terms? For instance, is validation only about checking for correct action keywords (like “create,” “delete,” etc.) and the right context (like “channel”), or are you also filtering harmful and out-of-scope requests?\n\n2) Provide guidelines and examples—both positive and negative.  \n   – Positive examples: show how colloquial user inputs still map to valid actions (e.g., “kinda remove this channel” → interpret as “delete channel”).  \n   – Negative examples: show how the gatekeeper should respond if a request is clearly out of scope (like “tell me a joke and also create a channel”).  \n   – Explicitly mention that any “secondary” tasks outside your domain (e.g., jokes, small talk) should be noted but not processed.\n\n3) Separate “identifying request intent” from “evaluating request.”  \n   – First, the gatekeeper identifies what the user really wants (the core action).  \n   – Then it decides if that action is valid, invalid, or ambiguous.  \n   – If there’s ambiguity (like a user combining multiple requests or using vague language), the gatekeeper’s job might be to request clarification or break down the request into parts.\n\n4) Encourage the gatekeeper to defer when uncertain.  \n   – Instead of hallucinating or “filling in the blanks,” the gatekeeper can politely say, “This request is unclear; do you mean X, Y, or Z?” or “It looks like you want multiple things. Which is priority?”  \n   – That not only prevents it from making incorrect assumptions but also gives users a chance to clarify a casual or slang expression.\n\n5) Use “strictness toggles” in your design.  \n   – You can maintain a separate parameter or “mode” that determines how lenient the gatekeeper should be. For example, in “strict mode,” it might require an exact match or well-formed directive. In “lenient mode,” it tries to match synonyms.  \n   – These modes can be switched based on context or the user’s role (e.g., an admin vs. a general user).\n\n6) Consider a fallback or multi-step approach.  \n   – If the first (cheaper) LLM is unsure or returns low confidence for a request, pass it to a more sophisticated routine that can parse nuance. Sometimes it’s a separate LLM or even a rule-based classifier to handle edge cases.  \n   – For truly ambiguous queries, you can send back a clarifying question to the user before calling the expensive model.\n\n7) Use “explain your reasoning” carefully.  \n   – Asking the model to “explain” can help you see whether it’s about to hallucinate or combine out-of-scope tasks. However, guard that chain of thought from the user—you don’t want to leak your system’s logic if that’s sensitive.\n\n8) Iterate with real-world user data.  \n   – Your best “fine-tuning” (even if informal) comes from capturing cases where the gatekeeper fails or is overly strict. Real user queries reveal the quirks of language that might not appear in contrived test prompts.  \n   – Keep a feedback loop where you tag false positives/negatives and adjust your examples and prompt guidelines accordingly.\n\nOverall, the biggest lever you have is clarity: the more you can simplify and focus the gatekeeper on recognizing clear, domain-relevant actions—and either deferring or clarifying when it’s beyond that domain—the more reliable it will behave. Balancing “strict vs. flexible” is rarely solved in a single iteration, so incorporating a feedback mechanism (including user clarifications and real-world usage data) will progressively fine-tune your guardrails.",

          "response": "Here are some thoughts and strategies to consider for balancing smart intent detection with rigorous safety guidelines in your gatekeeper prompt:\n\n1. Use a Defined Command Schema:\n • Defining a clear set of allowed commands (and possibly additional parameters) can help. If you have a fixed list of operations (e.g., delete, create, update), try to have the gatekeeper map the natural language to these specific commands.  \n • Provide examples in the prompt that show different colloquial ways of saying each command. That way, the model learns that even “kinda delete this channel” should map to a delete action.\n\n2. Layered or Sequential Processing:\n • Consider a two-step process. In the first stage, the gatekeeper parses the input into a structured format (e.g., “command”: \"delete\", “target”: \"channel\"). In the second stage, validate the structure exactly against your allowed command list.  \n • You could also run a disambiguation step: if your system is uncertain (e.g., multiple interpreted commands), have the model flag it for human review or ask a clarifying question back to the user.\n\n3. Enforce a Strict Separation of Concerns:\n • In cases where multiple requests are queued in one input (e.g., “create a channel and tell me a joke”), instruct the model to ignore or reject any part that falls outside the allowed operation set.  \n • A possible approach is to explicitly instruct the LLM: “If you recognize commands outside the permitted set, only process or return the valid commands. Do NOT attempt to process or parse additional information that you’re not explicitly allowed to.”  \n • This might include a request like “if any text is not part of the valid command syntax, please output a clarifying error message.”\n\n4. Incorporate Confidence or Fallback Strategies:\n • If a request is ambiguous (for example, if the model is not 100% sure whether a colloquial phrase maps to a valid command), have the gatekeeper return a safe fallback. For example, “I’m not sure what you mean. Could you please clarify?”  \n • Rather than risk processing actions based on partial or low-confidence interpretations, a fallback approach could mitigate unintended operations.\n\n5. Use Controlled Examples and Test Cases:\n • Running a comprehensive set of test inputs (including edge cases) can help you tune how strict or flexible the prompt is.  \n • Examples should range from clear, formal commands to very colloquial inputs. Evaluating these systematically may help you adjust wording in the prompt to catch nuances without opening up the risk of hallucinating or over-interpreting.\n\n6. Consider Hybrid Approaches:\n • Some teams address this not solely with the LLM prompt but by pairing the LLM’s output with additional programmable validation rules—essentially a post-processing step to ensure complete adherence to permitted actions.  \n • For example, if the LLM returns “delete channel” plus extra instructions like “tell me a joke,” the post-processor can reject any output with extraneous content.\n\n7. Documentation and Training Feedback:\n • Document your examples and instruct the model about what should be omitted even if mentioned. Reinforce that only specific directives related to allowed operations should be parsed and processed.  \n • If possible, run an iterative training loop where rejected requests or ambiguous cases are fed back into the system to continuously refine the guardrail behavior.\n\nBy iterating on these strategies and testing with a broad set of scenarios, you can better tune your prompt. Remember that often the combination of a well-crafted prompt with additional programmatic sanity checks leads to a robust solution—especially in cases where safety is paramount.\n\nLet me know if you’d like to discuss any of these points further or explore additional ideas!",

          "response": "You're facing a common challenge with prompt-based gatekeepers. The tradeoff you're describing—between strictness (high safety, lower flexibility) and flexibility (better user experience but higher hallucination and ambiguity)—is indeed tricky. Here are several strategies and considerations I've found helpful when tackling similar issues:\n\n### 1. Clearly Define Boundaries (Explicit Instructions)\n- **Explicit Allowlist:** Clearly enumerate allowable actions (e.g., \"delete channel,\" \"create channel,\" \"rename channel\"). Keep the gatekeeper focused narrowly on intent classification rather than interpretation.\n- **Explicit Denylist (if applicable):** Explicitly call out actions that must never be permitted. Sometimes explicitly prohibiting actions can help the gatekeeper avoid hallucinating or overreaching.\n\n### 2. Multi-Step Classification\nInstead of relying on a single prompt to detect intent and validity simultaneously, consider splitting into multiple classification steps:\n- **Step 1 (Intent Detection):** Classify the request into known intents (e.g., delete, create, rename) or \"out-of-scope.\"\n- **Step 2 (Scope Validation):** After identifying an intent, separately validate that the request conforms to allowed parameters and doesn't include extraneous instructions.\n\nThis layered approach reduces hallucinations because each step focuses on a simpler, clearly defined sub-task.\n\n### 3. Structured Outputs and Classifier Prompts (\"Chain-of-Thought\" style)\n- Ask the model for structured responses explicitly:\n  ```markdown\n  Action: <Allowed Action | Out-of-scope>\n  Confidence: <High|Medium|Low>\n  Notes: <Brief explanation>\n  ```\n- By explicitly requesting reasoning (\"Notes\"), you encourage the model to articulate its classification reasoning. This can help debug and improve the prompt iteratively.\n\n### 4. Calibrated Flexibility & Intent Normalization\n- **Normalization:** Include examples of colloquial phrasing in your prompt to teach the model about casual language (\"kinda delete\", \"just get rid of it\", etc.). Explicitly demonstrate how these map onto formal intents.\n- **Calibrated Flexibility:** Clearly instruct the model to be flexible about user wording but strict about allowed actions. For example:\n  > \"Be tolerant of casual, colloquial language and slang. If the user's intent clearly maps onto an allowed action, accept it. If the action is ambiguous or clearly outside the allowed scope, reject it.\"\n\n### 5. Validation-by-Example (Few-shot examples)\n- Provide specific \"boundary examples\" in your prompt to illustrate exactly how borderline cases should be handled. For example:\n  ```\n  User: \"kinda delete this channel\"\n  Response: Action: delete_channel | Confidence: High | Notes: Casual language, intent clearly matches 'delete_channel'.\n\n  User: \"create a channel and tell me a joke\"\n  Response: Action: Out-of-scope | Confidence: High | Notes: Contains extraneous instruction 'tell me a joke' outside allowed actions.\n  ```\n\n### 6. Separate \"Safety\" Validation from \"Intent\" Validation\nIf hallucination or overreach is a frequent problem, consider having a separate, simple safety classifier run after the intent classifier. This second step could explicitly reject requests containing extraneous instructions, jokes, or anything not strictly within your allowed domain.\n\n### 7. Consider Confidence Thresholding and Human-in-the-loop\n- If your domain involves high risk or ambiguity, implement a confidence threshold.

Here are some thoughts and strategies to consider:\n\n1. Intent Classification: Instead of trying to make a single prompt that covers all cases, consider using a two-step approach. First, use a simpler model to classify the general intent of the request (e.g., \"delete\", \"create\", \"modify\"). Then, use a more specific prompt tailored to that intent for validation.\n\n2. Explicit Allowlist: Maintain a clear, explicit list of allowed actions in your prompt. This helps prevent the model from validating out-of-scope actions.\n\n3. Context-Aware Prompting: Include relevant context about the system and its capabilities in the prompt. This can help the model better understand what actions are possible and relevant.\n\n4. Confidence Thresholds: Implement a confidence scoring system. If the model's confidence in its interpretation falls below a certain threshold, err on the side of caution and reject the request or escalate to human review.\n\n5. Multi-Turn Validation: For ambiguous requests, consider implementing a clarification dialogue to refine the user's intent before validation.\n\n6. Regular Expression Pre-filtering: Use regex or simple keyword matching as a first pass to catch obvious out-of-scope requests before they reach the LLM.\n\n7. Negative Examples: Include examples of what not to validate in your prompt. This can help prevent hallucination and over-interpretation.\n\n8. Periodic Retraining: Regularly update your model with new examples based on real-world usage patterns and edge cases encountered.\n\n9. Fallback Mechanisms: Implement a \"safety net\" that catches any requests that slip through the initial validation but are caught by the more powerful model.\n\n10. Audit Logging: Maintain detailed logs of all requests, validations, and actions for security auditing and continuous improvement of the system.\n\nRemember, no system is perfect, and there will always be edge cases. The key is to create a robust framework that can be iteratively improved over time.\n\nI'd be happy to discuss this further if you have any specific questions or scenarios you'd like to explore.

Multi-Layer Validation Architecture**\nInstead of relying on a single gatekeeper prompt, consider a tiered approach:\n- Layer 1: Intent classification (what type of action?)\n- Layer 2: Scope validation (is this action permitted?)\n- Layer 3: Parameter extraction and validation\n\n**2. Explicit Action Taxonomy**\nDefine a clear whitelist of supported actions with variations:\n```\nDELETE: [\"delete\", \"remove\", \"kinda delete\", \"get rid of\"]\nCREATE: [\"create\", \"make\", \"add\", \"set up\"]\n```\nThis helps the gatekeeper recognize colloquial language while maintaining boundaries.\n\n**3. Request Decomposition Strategy**\nFor compound requests like \"create a channel and tell me a joke\":\n- Parse into discrete intents\n- Validate each separately\n- Only pass through the in-scope portions\n- Explicitly reject out-of-scope elements\n\n## Security-Focused Prompting Patterns\n\n**Fail-Safe Defaults**: Structure prompts to default to rejection when uncertain, with specific confidence thresholds.\n\n**Explicit Boundary Setting**: Use negative examples in your prompt to show what should be rejected, not just what should be accepted.\n\n**Structured Output**: Force the gatekeeper to return structured responses (JSON) with reasoning, confidence scores, and extracted parameters.\n\n## Key Security Questions\n\n- How do you handle prompt injection attempts through user input?\n- What's your logging/monitoring strategy for rejected vs. approved requests?\n- Have you tested edge cases where colloquial language might mask malicious intent?\n\nThe balance you're seeking often requires iterative refinement with real user data.

Here are some strategic perspectives and prompting approaches that might help:\n\n**1. Explicit Scoping and Constraints:**  \nMake the gatekeeper's job very clear in the prompt. For example:  \n> \"Your only job is to decide if the user's request is a valid command for [system]—not to interpret, not to rephrase, just to say YES or NO. Valid commands are: [list]. Ignore any other content.\"\n\nThis reduces hallucination by narrowing the agent's scope.\n\n**2. Emphasize Partial Matches and Intent:**  \nColloquial language is tricky. You can ask the LLM to focus on user *intent* rather than exact wording:  \n> \"Accept requests if the user's intent matches a valid command, even if informal language is used. Reject if no valid intent can be inferred.\"\n\n**3. Structured Output:**  \nRequest a very constrained output format, such as:  \n> \"Respond only with YES or NO. No explanations.\"\n\nThis helps prevent the model from overreaching.\n\n**4. Hierarchical Filtering:**  \nConsider a two-pass approach:  \n- First, a very permissive filter to catch \"obviously invalid\" requests.\n- Second, a more nuanced check for subtle cases where intent is ambiguous.\n\n**5. Negative Examples in the Prompt:**  \nProvide explicit examples of what *not* to accept, especially multi-intent or out-of-scope requests.\n\n**6. Regular Prompt Auditing:**  \nReview failures regularly and update your prompt with new edge cases—this \"prompt tuning\" is iterative and crucial.\n\n**7. Consider an External Parser:**  \nSometimes, hybrid approaches work best: use a rule-based or keyword filter before/after the LLM to catch certain classes of errors, then let the LLM handle fuzzier cases.\n\n**8. Don’t Expect Perfection:**  \nLLMs are probabilistic. Instead of chasing a perfect prompt, consider designing your system so that occasional misclassifications are safe or recoverable.\n\n**9. Dataset for Evaluation:**  \nBuild a small set of diverse test inputs (valid, invalid, edge cases) and evaluate prompt variants systematically rather than ad hoc.\n\n**10. Fine-Tuning (if feasible):**  \nIf you control the model, fine-tuning on your specific command set and edge cases is more robust than prompt engineering alone.\n\n---\n\n**In summary:**  \n- Be explicit and narrow in your instructions  \n- Use examples, especially negative ones  \n- Constrain output  \n- Iterate with real user data\n\nThis is a classic \"guardrails\" challenge—if you'd like to discuss specific examples or edge cases, drop a few here!

Here are a few strategic considerations I’ve seen frequently in such setups:\n\n1) Clearly Distinguish the “What” vs. the “How.”  \n   • What = which action (create channel, delete channel, etc.) the user is requesting.  \n   • How = style, nuance, additional requests, jokes, etc.  \n   Splitting the user’s request mentally into these two dimensions can help isolate the “trigger” (the user’s core intent) from any extra fluff or phrasing. One idea is to prompt your gatekeeper model to produce a minimal parse: “Here is the action they want,” ignoring nonessential context.\n\n2) Allow Some Fuzziness, But Enforce the “No-Go” Lines.  \n   • Give the model permission to interpret “kinda delete” as a request to “delete”—that’s acceptable fuzziness.  \n   • But define very explicit rules for topics or requests that must be hard-blocked (e.g. certain security-sensitive areas or policy violations).  \n   This is somewhat akin to a tiered approach: if it’s near an obviously allowed request, interpret charitably; if it’s near a disallowed request, reject decisively.\n\n3) Use a Short, Direct Instruction. Long prompts can lead to Hallucination.  \n   • Sometimes we try to bulletproof the prompt with lots of policy text—but ironically, that can confuse the model.  \n   • A lean, direct instruction telling the gatekeeper “Identify the single user action requested; do not attempt to handle extra instructions like jokes or commentary” might reduce drifting into out-of-scope tasks.\n\n4) Emphasize Confidence Thresholds or “I’m Not Sure” Paths.  \n   • Let the gatekeeper propose three outcomes: valid request, invalid request, or uncertain.  \n   • If it’s uncertain, either ask for clarification from the user or escalate to a more thorough check.  \n   That way you don’t have to make the filter do all or nothing—it can “punt” when it’s not sure.\n\n5) Consider a Minimal Classification Step with a Task-Specific Model.  \n   • Instead of making the gatekeeper figure out everything, have it do a single job: basically a classification (e.g. “Which type of action does the user want, if any?”).  \n   • Then a second step can decide if it’s valid or not.  \n   This pipelined approach can reduce how often you slip into letting the gatekeeper do the more general, “powerful” thinking that leads to confusion or hallucination.\n\nFrom experience, once you start layering these ideas—focusing on minimal instructions, short direct prompts, clear “yes/no/ask for clarification” outcomes—you inch closer to that sweet spot of “strict enough to reject nonsense but flexible enough to parse natural language.” Hope this gives you some fresh angles to try!",

          "response": "Your problem is one that many have encountered when building multi-stage LLM systems—balancing precision without sacrificing the natural flexibility users expect. Here are some strategic considerations and prompting approaches that might help you move forward:\n\n1. Layered or iterative instructions. One idea is to have the gatekeeper operate in two passes: first, a rough categorization of what the user is asking (for example, identifying the main command like “delete,” “create,” etc.) and then a verification that that action is permitted or fits within the known context. Splitting the task may help you isolate and reduce “hallucinating” extraneous parts.\n\n2. Use of examples in prompts. Including a short list of examples with both acceptable and non-acceptable requests can help guide the LLM. For instance, provide explicit examples such as:  \n • \"kinda delete this channel\" → acceptable (needs to be normalized to “delete”);  \n • \"please create a channel and tell me a joke\" → flagged for multiple actions.  \nThis few-shot strategy can help the model learn to ignore secondary requests or non-critical embellishments.\n\n3. Constraint-based decomposition. Instead of one monolithic prompt, consider prompting the LLM to break down the request. For instance, instruct it to answer in two parts:\n a. Identify the primary action (with a fixed message like “action: delete”).\n b. Verify whether this is a valid command.\nThis decomposition forces the model to literally separate what’s essential from embellishments, reducing unintended validations.\n\n4. Emphasize domain-specific vocabulary. If you can restrict the domain language (or provide a dictionary mapping colloquialisms to canonical commands), then you might be able to steer the model toward understanding intended actions reliably. Even if the initial request is informal, you can train or prompt the model to rephrase commands into a stricter canonical form before passing them on.\n\n5. Balance strictness with some “tolerance” clause. You might add instructions that if the request is ambiguous or includes extraneous actions, to flag it as ambiguous rather than outright rejecting. For example, “If the request includes additional information beyond a primary command, respond only with clarification questions or ask for a single action.” This might preserve user intent while safeguarding downstream actions.\n\n6. Iterative improvement and human-in-the-loop. As you work through different examples, log where the gatekeeper fails. Then, iterate on your prompt with additional examples, refining based on edge cases. Consider even having a fallback where ambiguous cases go to a human reviewer or a more detailed multi-agent conversation within the gatekeeper.\n\nBy combining these strategies, you’ll likely find a balance between being too strict and too flexible. It often comes down to testing a broad set of varied user inputs, ensuring that the examples guide the model without overconstraining it. Keep in mind that some level of imperfection is almost inevitable in NLP pipelines, so having a clear strategy for ambiguous cases is key.\n\nIt sounds like you’re on the right track—sometimes iteratively refining the process based on real-world examples can provide the necessary insight to break the loop. Hopefully these ideas provide a starting point for further experimentation and discussion. Good luck with your system!",

Explicit Instruction Hierarchy**\nStructure your prompt with clear priority rules:\n```\nPRIMARY: Extract the core action intent\nSECONDARY: Map to allowed actions list\nTERTIARY: Reject only if no valid mapping exists\n```\n\n**4. Return Structured Output**\nInstead of binary accept/reject, have the gatekeeper return:\n- Detected intent(s)\n- Confidence level\n- Which parts are valid/invalid\n\nThis gives you more control over the final decision.\n\n**5. \"Principle of Charitable Interpretation\"**\nExplicitly instruct the model to interpret ambiguous requests in the most reasonable way that maps to valid actions, rather than being pedantic.\n\nThe key insight is that you're not just filtering - you're doing intent recognition + validation. Separating these concerns (even within a single prompt) often leads to better results.\n\nWhat specific approach are you currently using? Happy to dive deeper into any of these strategies!",

For example:  \n   \"You only respond to requests about X, Y, and Z actions. If a request is not clearly about those, reject it.\"  \n   This helps cut down on hallucinated acceptance of out-of-scope requests.\n\n2. **Single-Intent Enforcement**  \n   Have the prompt ask for a single, clear intent. If the user input contains multiple actions (e.g., \"create a channel and tell me a joke\"), the gatekeeper should flag it as ambiguous or multi-intent, and reject or ask for clarification.  \n   Example:  \n   \"Only process requests that contain one action. If more than one action or intent is present, reject the request.\"\n\n3. **Examples and Edge Cases**  \n   Provide the model with varied examples, including colloquial, indirect, or partial requests.  \n   - Valid: \"Can you nuke this channel?\", \"Wanna delete this?\", \"Delete the channel, please.\"  \n   - Invalid: \"Tell me a joke.\", \"What's the weather?\"  \n   This helps the LLM generalize better without being too rigid.\n\n4. **Chain-of-Thought or Self-Ask**  \n   Encourage the model to \"think aloud\" in the prompt before making a decision.  \n   - \"First, determine if the request is about [action]. If yes, accept. If not, reject.\"  \n   This often makes it more deliberate and less likely to hallucinate.\n\n5. **Reject Uncertainty**  \n   If the LLM is unsure, instruct it to err on the side of caution and reject or ask for clarification.  \n   - \"If you are unsure whether the input matches a valid action, reject the request.\"\n\n6. **Iterative Prompt Refinement**  \n   Regularly review false positives/negatives and keep tweaking your examples and instructions.  \n   Over time, you’ll find the sweet spot for your specific use case and user population.\n\nIt’s a balancing act, and you’ll probably always be slightly tuning for your application’s tolerance to errors in either direction.

For instance, clarifying how it should parse requests, what types of requests should be flagged or rejected, and what types should pass through. You can create a bulleted list of rules in the system prompt that the gatekeeper checks against:\n\n• Focus on “what to do,” not “how to do it.” This keeps the gatekeeper from trying to perform the actual action or hallucinate details. The gatekeeper’s job is strictly validation, so make that clear.  \n• Avoid absolute statements in your instructions; instead, provide examples of borderline phrasing so the model is more tolerant of slight variations in language.  \n• Incorporate minimal safe completions. For instance, if the user’s request is ambiguous, direct the gatekeeper to respond that it “needs clarification” rather than trying to fill in details.  \n\nIf you want the model to handle multiple tasks in a single user request (like “create a channel and tell me a joke”), consider telling it explicitly: “If more than one valid action is detected, pass them all along. When you see an extra request that’s out of scope, surface it separately for the user to clarify or remove.”  \n\nYou can also do some light classification before even letting the gatekeeper see the prompt—say, using a lightweight embedding or keyword-based filter to detect obviously out-of-scope tasks. Then, only the borderline or allowed tasks go to the gatekeeper.  \n\nFinally, be prepared for iterative refinement: gather real user examples, see how your gatekeeper handles them, and tweak the prompt using those edge cases as guidance.

          "response": "It sounds like you’re wrestling with the classic trade-off between recall and precision when it comes to interpreting natural language—and that balancing act becomes even trickier when you add safety guardrails into the mix. Here are some thoughts from my own experience tinkering with similar systems:\n\n1. Break Down the Task: Rather than expecting one prompt to do everything perfectly in a single pass, consider a multi-step approach. For instance, the first “step” could be a chain-of-thought extraction where the model explains its interpretation of the input. Then, a second step could distill that reasoning into a single canonical action (or a rejection if the input doesn’t meet criteria). By having an intermediate stage, you give the system a chance to parse colloquial language (“kinda delete this channel”) into an explicit intent (“delete channel”).\n\n2. Explicitly Define the Scope and Priorities: Craft instructions that clearly state which parts of a compound query are in-scope. For example, you might tell the LLM: “Only process requests related to channel management. If the request includes other elements—like asking for a joke—ignore those elements and focus solely on validating the channel instruction.” Having such explicit directions can force the model to ignore out-of-scope extras without hallucinating processes for those parts.\n\n3. Use Few-Shot Examples Intelligent: Give the gatekeeper a few representative examples of acceptable ways to express valid requests (even colloquial versions) alongside examples of compound or invalid requests. That way, the model can learn the “mapping” from informal phrasing to the command intent while learning to discard or flag extraneous tasks.\n\n4. Fallback and Clarification Strategies: Instead of trying to get the prompt to always deterministically infer the intended action, consider having the gatekeeper output uncertainty flags when it’s not entirely sure. For example, if multiple interpretations are plausible, the system could ask for clarification instead of defaulting to a potentially unsafe or inappropriate interpretation. This creates a middle ground between being overly strict and overly flexible.\n\n5. Layered Filtering: You might also consider a two-tier approach, where a preliminary parser “normalizes” the input into a structured format that is then validated by a second LLM. This can help in disambiguating tasks (for instance, separating “create a channel” from “tell me a joke”) before any action is taken.\n\n6. Experiment with Temperature and Constraints: Sometimes, a slight tweak in generation parameters (like lowering the temperature for the gatekeeper call) can reduce hallucination. You might also enforce a structure in the output—such as a fixed JSON format—that forces the model to commit to a clear, unambiguous interpretation. This structure can include fields like “action,” “target,” “extras,” etc., making it easier for the downstream system to decide what to do with any additional text.\n\nIn summary, there’s rarely a one-size-fits-all prompt. It might take a combination of multi-step reasoning, explicit scope definitions, guided examples, and layered processing to hit that sweet spot. In your case, starting with a chain-of-thought breakdown to extract intent, followed by a filtering stage that focuses solely on the approved actions, might be a promising strategy.\n\nHopefully, these ideas can help break your loop and spark some new approaches to your design.

This is a common issue that many developers face when trying to create a reliable gatekeeper for more powerful language models.\n\nThe core balance you're trying to strike is indeed a tricky one. On one hand, you want the gatekeeper to be flexible enough to understand natural, colloquial language, but on the other, you need it to be strict enough to reliably filter out invalid or out-of-scope requests.\n\nA few key strategies I've found effective in addressing this:\n\n1. **Hierarchical Prompting**: Consider using a multi-stage prompting approach, where the initial gatekeeper model is focused solely on validating the core intent of the request (e.g., \"delete\", \"create\"), and then passing that validated intent to a second model that can handle more complex, open-ended inputs.\n\n2. **Contextual Understanding**: Leverage the context of the conversation or the user's previous interactions to better understand their intent. This can help the gatekeeper model disambiguate colloquial language and differentiate between valid and invalid requests.\n\n3. **Controlled Vocabulary**: Carefully curate the set of actions, entities, and other domain-specific concepts that the gatekeeper model is trained to understand. This can help prevent it from hallucinating or attempting to process out-of-scope inputs.\n\n4. **Iterative Refinement**: Continuously monitor the gatekeeper model's performance and refine the prompting, training data, and other parameters based on the types of inputs it struggles with. This iterative process can help you gradually improve the balance between flexibility and safety.\n\n5. **Explainability and Transparency**: Consider adding an explanation component to the gatekeeper model, so that it can provide users with clear feedback on why a particular request was accepted or rejected. This can help build trust and improve the overall user experience.\n\nI'd be happy to discuss these strategies in more detail and share specific examples from my own experience. Feel free to reach out, and we can explore different prompting approaches and architectural patterns that might work well for your use case.",

If the request is ambiguous or contains additional requests, reject it.\"\n\n### 2. **Stepwise Reasoning**\n- Ask the gatekeeper to **first paraphrase or classify** the user intent in plain language, then make the accept/reject decision based on that paraphrase/classification.\n- This catches edge cases where colloquial or fuzzy language is used, as the LLM will internally \"translate\" before applying rules.\n\n### 3. **Reject on Multi-intent**\n- Add an explicit instruction:  \n  \"If the request contains more than one intent or asks for information outside the permitted actions, reject the entire request.\"\n\n### 4. **Allow for Synonyms and Colloquial Language**\n- In the prompt, encourage the model to look for *meaning*, not just keywords.\n- Example:  \n  \"Accept requests even if the user uses casual, misspelled, or slang phrases, as long as their intent is clear and matches a permitted action.\"\n\n### 5. **Prompt Iteration & Test Harness**\n- **Build a test suite** of edge cases (colloquial, multi-intent, slightly ambiguous, etc.) and run them through the gatekeeper prompt. Tweak prompt wording based on failures.\n- This is often the only way to find the right balance—lots of manual iteration.\n\n### 6. **Intermediate \"Intent Extraction\" Stage**\n- Instead of a single gatekeeper, consider a two-stage process:\n  1. **Intent extraction/normalization** (what does the user really want?).\n  2. **Validation** (is that intent in-scope?).\n- This can be two prompts or two separate models.\n\n### 7. **Fallback or Escalation**\n- If the gatekeeper is unsure, it can flag for human review or ask the user for clarification, rather than failing open or closed.\n\n### 8. **Prompt Phrasing Example**\n> You are a request validator. Your job is to decide if the user request is a valid, in-scope action.  \n> - Allow requests that clearly correspond to one of: [delete channel, rename channel, etc.], even if the user uses casual or misspelled language.  \n> - Reject requests containing multiple actions or any action outside this set.  \n> - If the intent is ambiguous, reject.  \n> Respond with \"ACCEPT\" or \"REJECT\" only.\n\n---\n\n**TL;DR:**  \n- Make scope and allowed actions explicit.\n- Teach the model to paraphrase intent before deciding.\n- Be clear that colloquial language is OK if intent is clear.\n- Reject multi-intent or out-of-scope requests.\n- Iterate with a test set of edge cases.\n\nThis is a nuanced balance, but with enough prompt iteration and edge-case testing, you’ll get there.

          "response": "One approach is to break this challenge into two parts:\n\n1) Sharpening the Gatekeeper’s Focus  \n   • Clearly define which categories of requests must be “allowed” vs. “blocked,” and which require user clarification. The more explicit you are about these categories, the easier it is to tune prompts.  \n   • Instead of aiming for a single “catch-all” prompt, consider a short classification step. If something is in a gray area (e.g., it contains colloquial text or multiple topics), the Gatekeeper can return a partial result like “Needs Clarification” or “Potentially Mixed Request,” which prompts the user (or a higher-level logic) to verify intent.  \n\n2) Being Explicit About What the Filter Should and Shouldn’t Do  \n   • Some prompt templates try to do everything at once—classify, interpret, reject, or refine. This can lead to unpredictable outcomes. One tactic is to keep these tasks discrete:  \n     – Detect whether the request is in scope.  \n     – Check for any disallowed or non-resolvable parts.  \n     – If valid, pass along to the main system; if invalid, provide a clear rejection reason.  \n   • For requests that combine several actions or topics (e.g., “create a channel and tell me a joke”), explicitly instruct the Gatekeeper to allow only the relevant subset. Then, either reject or ask for clarification about the rest.  \n\nAdditional Suggestions:  \n• Iterative Refinement: Start with an initial “strict” prompt, then systematically test it on known problem requests (both valid-though-colloquial and invalid queries) to see how it behaves. Loosen it up carefully until your acceptance/rejection rate hits an acceptable threshold.  \n• Edge-Case Dictionary: Keep a collection of frequent colloquialisms and edge cases. This helps you fine-tune the Gatekeeper while preventing unintended rejections of valid user input.  \n• Multiple Models or Pipelines: Depending on complexity, some teams use a small classification model purely as a “bouncer” (allow/block) and a second model that performs deeper analysis or rewriting before passing to the powerful system.  \n\nThe key is to create a feedback loop: define your pass/fail criteria, systematically test them, and iterate. This helps avoid overshooting the “strict vs. flexible” balance. If you have the time, layering or chaining specialized mini-checks can help keep the Gatekeeper from getting confused by out-of-scope or combined requests.",

          "response": "It sounds like you’re grappling with a classic trade-off: make your gatekeeper strict enough to catch out-of-scope or malformed requests while retaining the necessary flexibility to interpret colloquial input. Here are a few strategies you might explore:\n\n1. Define clear scope boundaries up front. Craft a prompt that explicitly outlines what kinds of requests are valid and what falls outside your “safe” zone. For example, you might list acceptable operations and provide examples. This helps the gatekeeper model ground its response in the intended use case.\n\n2. Layer your validation. Instead of a single, monolithic prompt that must do everything (interpret natural language nuances while enforcing constraints), consider breaking the problem into two stages:\n • First, use a lightweight prompt to determine the “intent” of the user message in a flexible way.\n • Then, apply a second, more structured check against a whitelist or set of defined operations. This division can help keep each part simpler while still covering both bases.\n\n3. Introduce controlled paraphrasing. To deal with colloquial or “leet” language without making the prompt too rigid, try including examples that show variant inputs (e.g., “kindly delete this channel” versus “k1nd@ d31e7e 7#15 channel”). These examples can help steer the model toward understanding paraphrased intents without opening the door to misinterpretations.\n\n4. Utilize scoring or thresholding. If the gatekeeper model generates a confidence score or can rank different interpretations, set a threshold to decide whether to forward the request or ask for clarification. For example, if the intent extraction isn’t confident enough that the command is within scope, the gatekeeper could request a rephrasing or additional confirmation.\n\n5. Experiment with iterative prompt refinement. Start with a prompt that errs on the side of caution and then gradually relax restrictions while monitoring for unwanted behavior. Often, the goal state emerges by testing and adjusting based on real-world inputs rather than solely relying on theoretical prompt design.\n\n6. Consider multi-turn clarifications. If a request is borderline, design your system so the gatekeeper can ask follow-up questions to confirm user intent before taking action. This iterative approach can help balance between over-filtering and under-filtering.\n\nEach application might require a different blend of these strategies, so the idea is to experiment and see which combination yields the best performance in both safety and usability for your use-case. Hope this second opinion helps—good luck with your system!\n\nFeel free to DM me if you’d like to dive deeper into any of these approaches.",

A few strategies I've found helpful:\n\n### 1\\. Two-stage prompting (Decomposition):\n- **Stage 1 (Intent extraction)**: First, ask the gatekeeper model to explicitly extract one or more clearly defined allowed intents from the user's request, ignoring ambiguous or unsupported parts.\n- **Stage 2 (Validation)**: Pass only the extracted intent(s) to a second gatekeeper step to confirm validity. This reduces hallucination because the second stage sees a cleaned-up intent rather than the raw user input.\n\n### 2\\. Explicit scope definition and negative examples:\n- Clearly enumerate allowed actions in the prompt, and explicitly mention actions or examples that are out-of-scope.\n- Provide illustrative positive and negative examples—this improves the model’s discrimination capability without overly strict wording, making it flexible yet robust.\n\n### 3\\. Progressive fallback prompts:\n- Begin with a somewhat strict prompt. If the model rejects a user input, you can automatically retry with slightly relaxed constraints (e.g., allowing colloquial wording). This layered approach maintains safety yet gives you a second chance to correctly interpret informal phrasing.\n\n### 4\\. Confidence-based prompting:\n- Request the model explicitly indicate its confidence in validating the user intent. If the model expresses uncertainty, pass the input to a human-in-the-loop or a more robust validation mechanism.\n\n### 5\\. Contextual clarification prompts:\n- If unclear, ask the model to generate a clarification question for the user rather than outright rejecting or hallucinating. This maintains smooth UX and avoids false negatives.\n\nYou might already be leveraging some of these approaches, but usually combining two-stage prompting and explicit positive/negative examples significantly improves model robustness.\n\nHappy to discuss further via DM if you'd like!",

Here’s a step-by-step breakdown of your situation, plus some general strategy pointers for prompt engineering and design:\n\n### 1. **Clarify the Scope of Valid Requests**\n   - **Define what counts as a valid action** in clear, unambiguous terms (ideally in a spec or table).\n   - **List edge cases** and borderline phrasings you want to allow (e.g., \"kinda delete\" vs. \"delete\").\n\n### 2. **Prompt Design: Strictness vs. Flexibility**\n   - **Strict prompts** (e.g. \"Only accept requests that *exactly* match these command patterns\") are precise but brittle.\n   - **Flexible prompts** (e.g. \"Accept anything that looks like a deletion request\") are inclusive but risk overgeneralization and hallucination.\n\n### 3. **Iterative Prompt Tuning**\n   - **Start strict, then gradually relax**: Begin with a narrow, pattern-based prompt and slowly add paraphrase capability, testing each change.\n   - **Test with a diverse dataset**: Use real user inputs to expose where your filter is too tight or loose.\n\n### 4. **Prompt Techniques to Try**\n   - **Explicitly ask for single action extraction:**  \n     _“Identify and validate only the primary actionable request in the following input, ignoring unrelated content. If the request is ambiguous, reject it.”_\n   - **Use examples in the prompt:**  \n     _Show accepted and rejected inputs, especially for tricky cases (“kinda delete”, “delete and tell a joke”)._\n   - **Chain-of-thought prompting:**  \n     _“First, restate the user’s request in clear terms.

If not, explain why.”_  \n     This can help the LLM “think out loud” and avoid hallucinations.\n\n### 5. **Guardrail Strategies Beyond Prompting**\n   - **Pre-filtering:** Use regex or simple classifiers to flag out-of-scope or multi-intent requests.\n   - **Post-validation:** If the “gatekeeper” is unsure, return an “ambiguous” status rather than passing or rejecting outright.\n\n### 6. **Human-in-the-Loop (optional)**\n   - For ambiguous/edge cases, flag for manual review or prompt the user to clarify.\n\n### 7. **Regular Review & Feedback Loop**\n   - Periodically audit rejected/accepted requests to spot drift or new failure modes.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n- **Iteratively tune your prompt** with real data.\n- **Use clear, specific instructions** and examples in the prompt.\n- **Aim for single-intent extraction** and ignore secondary/unrelated requests.\n- **Complement LLM gating** with light-weight, non-LLM filters when possible.\n\nIt’s a balancing act, and you’ll likely need to revisit as your system sees more real-world usage.

Opening and Context:\n   • The message starts with a greeting (“Hey everyone”), suggesting it’s part of a larger discussion forum or group conversation.  \n   • The writer sets the stage by stating they’re working on a system involving a “gatekeeper” LLM.\n\n2. Purpose of the Gatekeeper LLM:\n   • The system uses a cheaper, simpler LLM to validate user requests in natural language.  \n   • Once validated, requests go to a more powerful (and expensive) model.  \n   • Main objective: “filter out invalid requests cheaply and reliably.”\n\n3. Core Challenge (Balancing Strictness and Flexibility):\n   • Problem 1: If the LLM’s prompt is too strict, valid inputs (especially informal or colloquial ones) may get rejected.  \n   • Example of strictness issue: “kinda delete this channel” is rejected instead of interpreted as a valid “delete” command.  \n   • Problem 2: If the LLM’s prompt is too flexible, it might hallucinate or sidetrack (for instance, trying to validate out-of-scope actions in the same request).\n\n4. Specific Example of Overly Flexible Behavior:\n   • A single user request, e.g., “create a channel and tell me a joke,” might cause the gatekeeper LLM to incorrectly proceed with both tasks (including the out-of-scope “tell me a joke”), rather than focusing on the relevant “create a channel” request.\n\n5. Description of Frustration:\n   • The author feels they are “close” to a solution but stuck in fine-tuning the prompt.  \n   • They describe being “in a loop” of iterating the prompt but not hitting the right balance.\n\n6. Request for Feedback and Insights:\n   • The writer is looking for anyone with experience creating robust LLM agents or implementing complex safety/guardrails.  \n   • They emphasize they’re not requesting code, only strategic or conceptual advice.\n\n7. Invitation to Continue the Conversation:\n   • The author offers to follow up via direct message (DM) if someone has relevant experience.  \n   • They close with a friendly “thanks,” keeping the tone open for discussion.\n\n8. Overall Communication Style:\n   • Casual but practical: “quick chat about strategy” indicates they don’t want overly technical deep dives at this point—just insights.  \n   • The writer is polite, acknowledges the complexity, and is open to collaboration.\n\n9. Main Takeaway:\n   • The biggest issue is fine-tuning the gatekeeper LLM’s prompt to handle human language variations while not overstepping its scope or hallucinating.  \n   • The post underscores a common challenge in building layered AI solutions where one model acts as a safeguard for another.\n\n10.

This establishes the subject matter and sets the stage for the discussion.\n\n2. Explanation of the System and Its Purpose  \n • The “gatekeeper” LLM is described as functioning as an initial filter for incoming natural language requests.  \n • The goal is clearly stated: to cheaply and reliably discard invalid or out-of-scope requests so that costly processing is reserved for appropriate inputs.\n\n3. Presentation of the Core Challenge  \n • The author details the core difficulty: striking the right balance in designing the prompt used by the gatekeeper.  \n • There are two extremes:  \n  – Too strict: This setting could reject valid user inputs, especially when users phrase their commands in a casual or colloquial way (e.g., interpreting “kinda delete this channel” incorrectly).  \n  – Too flexible: This might allow the system to \"hallucinate\" or get distracted by parts of a request not relevant to its intended function (e.g., processing a joke request along with a channel creation request).\n\n4. Illustration with Examples  \n • Two concrete examples are provided to clarify the problem:  \n  – One where the gatekeeper might misinterpret a colloquial command due to excessive strictness.  \n  – Another where too much flexibility leads to handling content (like joking or additional actions) that should be filtered out.\n\n5. Current Status and Request for Help  \n • The author expresses that they feel close to a solution but are currently stuck in a loop, indicating they’re at an impasse with finding the right prompting strategy.  \n • They explicitly request opinions or suggestions from individuals with experience in building robust LLM agents or setting up complex guardrails, framing the post as a call for advice, not for code examples.\n\n6. Call-to-Action and Interaction Offer  \n • The post ends by inviting comments and offering to send direct messages (DMs) for further discussion. This fosters community engagement and personal follow-up with interested experts.\n\n7. Conclusion and Polite Sign-Off  \n • The message concludes with a thank you, maintaining a polite and engaging tone, which encourages participation and shows appreciation for anyone who might help.\n\nOverall, the post outlines a real-world technical and design challenge while inviting collaborative discussion from a community likely to have encountered similar issues, making it both an informative and interactive call for expert input.",

          "response": "Salut ! Super question, et tu n’es clairement pas seul face à ce dilemme. J’ai bossé sur des systèmes assez similaires—et ce que tu décris, c’est LE nœud du prompt engineering pour les \"gatekeepers\" LLM.\n\nVoici quelques stratégies et retours d’expérience qui pourraient t’aider à avancer :\n\n---\n\n### 1. **Décomposition de l’intention**\nAu lieu de tout miser sur le prompt, essaie de décomposer la demande utilisateur en intentions atomiques (\"supprimer\", \"créer\", \"raconter une blague\", etc.). Demande explicitement au LLM de lister les actions présentes dans la requête, puis valide chaque action l’une après l’autre. C’est plus robuste contre les requêtes mixtes (\"fais X et Y\").\n\n*Exemple* :\n- \"Peux-tu supprimer ce canal et me donner la météo ?\"\n- Réponse attendue : `[\"supprimer canal\", \"donner météo\"]`\n\n---\n\n### 2. **Liste blanche d’actions**\nSois très explicite dans le prompt : “Accepte uniquement les actions suivantes : [liste]. Si l’intention ne correspond pas exactement à cette liste, rejette.”  \nCela réduit le risque d’hallucination, surtout si tu guides le modèle à répondre par “oui/non” ou à donner une classification stricte.\n\n---\n\n### 3. **Prompts contextuels + Exemples**\nDonne à ton prompt plusieurs exemples d’entrées \"limites\" (borderline), en montrant ce qu’il faut accepter ou rejeter.  \nInclue des exemples où la formulation est familière ou ambigüe pour entraîner le modèle à être tolérant sur la forme mais strict sur le fond.\n\n---\n\n### 4. **Double validation**\nUtilise deux passes :\n- Passage 1 : Extraction des intentions/actions.\n- Passage 2 : Validation stricte de chaque intention contre la politique de ton système.\n\n---\n\n### 5. **Feedback Loop et logs**\nLoggue systématiquement les faux positifs/faux négatifs et ajuste la prompt/stratégie toutes les semaines. Les edge cases évoluent vite avec les usages réels.\n\n---\n\n### 6. **Hybridation avec règles \"hard\"**\nParfois, un simple filtrage par regex ou par une table d’intentions en amont du LLM aide à réduire la charge sur le modèle, et donc à diminuer les hallucinations.\n\n---\n\n### 7. **Prompt “Refusal Policy”**\nSois explicite sur ce que le modèle doit refuser. Par exemple : \"Si la demande contient plus d’une action ou une action non reconnue, refuse et explique pourquoi.\"\n\n---\n\nBref, il n’y a pas de solution miracle, mais souvent une combinaison : prompt clair, exemples, post-traitement, logs, et feedback humain.\n\nSi tu veux en discuter plus en détail ou partager des exemples concrets, je suis dispo pour échanger en DM ou ici.\n\nBon courage, tu es sur la bonne voie !",

          "response": "Salut! C’est un sujet vraiment intéressant. La conception d’un « Gatekeeper » basé sur un LLM soulève en effet pas mal de défis. Voici quelques pistes de réflexion que j’ai pu voir ou expérimenter :\n\n1) Scinder la logique de filtrage :  \n   • Au lieu de reposer uniquement sur un seul prompt/contexte qui doit à la fois comprendre la requête et décider si elle est légitime, certains mettent en place deux niveaux.  \n     – Niveau 1 : Vérifier la validité formelle de la requête (sa faisabilité, la présence de mots-clés interdits, etc.) avec un modèle léger ou des règles plus « heuristiques ».  \n     – Niveau 2 : Dalyer, si la requête semble pertinente, confier la partie sémantique / intention à un prompt plus élaboré qui comprend mieux les nuances.  \n   • Cette approche réduit le risque que le même prompt doive à la fois « punir » (rejeter) et « comprendre en profondeur » (autoriser des variantes proches).\n\n2) Définir clairement la tâche (une segmentation explicite) :  \n   • Dans le prompt du Gatekeeper, préciser noir sur blanc quelles sont ses responsabilités. Par exemple :  \n     – « Certifie uniquement que la requête entre dans le cadre X.  \n        Ne propose pas d’alternatives.  \n        Ne tente pas de réaliser la requête si ce n’est pas explicitement dans le périmètre. »  \n   • Insister sur le fait que, s’il y a un doute, il accueille la requête comme « potentiellement valide » (ou inversement, selon la philosophie de la boîte) plutôt que de se lancer dans l’improvisation ou l’« hallucination » pour « aider » l’utilisateur.\n\n3) Gérer les edge cases par des règles ou du few-shot :  \n   • Pour certains termes sensibles qui posent problème (p. ex. « supprimer un canal » vs « supprimer ce canal »), il peut être utile d’ajouter un ou deux exemples de ce genre dans le prompt (few-shot).  \n   • Ainsi, tu montres explicitement au modèle comment répondre quand un utilisateur emploie un synonyme ou une formulation proche d’une commande légitime.\n\n4) Surveiller l’« intention » plutôt que la forme :  \n   • Souvent, quand le langage est ambigu, se baser uniquement sur la forme (le mot « supprimer ») peut être trop restrictif ou au contraire trop large.  \n   • Un angle utile consiste à injecter un « résumé sémantique » intermédiaire dans ton prompt :  \n     – « Reformule la requête en une phrase courte décrivant l’action principale demandée et son contexte. »  \n     – Ensuite, use ce résumé pour comparer la requête à la liste des actions autorisées ou attendues.  \n   • En pratique, c’est souvent plus résilient aux reformulations.\n\n5) Tester par grappes de scénarios :  \n   • Pour affiner le prompt, il est utile de tester en lots de scénarios variés, par exemple :  \n     – Des requêtes « clairement valides » avec des variations de vocabulaires.  \n     – Des requêtes « limites » (blague + action légitime, etc.).  \n     – Des requêtes « clairement hors sujet ».  \n   • Ça te permet de voir rapidement où le Gatekeeper se trompe.  \n   • Parfois, faire des tests semi-automatisés avec des datasets de requêtes synthétiques (générées en changeant des mots clés) aide à repérer les échecs systématiques.\n\n6) Faire valider le comportement final par quelques utilisateurs (ou une équipe QA) :  \n   • Même si un LLM est tenté de tout gérer « seul », parfois un workflow manuel (ou semi-automatisé) de validation pour les cas particuliers s’avère plus sûr.  \n   • Tu peux envisager un mécanisme de fallback : quand le Gatekeeper est incertain, il renvoie la requête pour un examen plus précis.\n\n7) Adapter la tolérance à l’erreur :  \n   • Rien n’oblige un Gatekeeper à avoir un taux de faux positifs/faux négatifs « parfait ». On peut décider d’être un peu plus strict ou un peu plus permissif selon la criticité du problème.  \n   • S’il est plus grave de laisser passer une requête interdite que de bloquer une requête valide, le déséquilibre peut être assumé (« On rejette potentiellement un peu plus que nécessaire »).  \n   • Inversement, si bloquer des utilisateurs à tort est coûteux en expérience, tu peux être plus enclin à laisser passer certaines ambiguïtés.\n\nEn gros, plus l’architecture est explicitement modulaire (filtrage lexical → filtrage sémantique → décision), plus on peut ajuster les règles à chaque étage sans trop perturber le modèle. Souvent, le mélange d’une petite étape heuristique (ou un petit classifieur) pour la partie « stricte » et d’un LLM plus à l’aise avec les nuances pour la partie flexible donne un résultat satisfaisant.\n\nJ’espère que ça t’aidera un peu à voir les différentes approches ! Ton système est déjà sur la bonne voie, et c’est une question de trouver l’équilibre qui convient à ton use case. N’hésite pas si tu as d’autres questions.",

          "response": "Voici quelques pistes de réflexion qui pourraient vous aider à affiner votre approche :\n\n1. Décomposer les tâches en étapes distinctes :  \n   • Plutôt que de demander à l'agent de valider simultanément la validité d'une demande et d'en extraire l'intention, vous pourriez concevoir un système en deux passes. La première passe identifie et extrait l'intention de l'utilisateur (par exemple en \"parsing\" ou en classification) et la seconde passe décide si cette intention est permise. Cela permet d'avoir des invites plus ciblées pour chaque tâche.\n\n2. Utiliser des exemples de cas limites (few-shot learning) :  \n   • Montrez à l'agent des exemples d'entrées acceptables et inacceptables. Pour le LLM de filtrage, intégrer des exemples qui illustrent à la fois des demandes légèrement non conventionnelles (mais valides) et des exemples de tentatives d'extraction d'informations secondaires (comme la blague dans \"Créer une chaîne et me raconter une blague\"). Ces exemples contextuels aident le système à apprendre la nuance sans être trop strict.\n\n3. Encourager la clarification plutôt que l'action immédiate :  \n   • Lorsque l'intention n'est pas parfaitement claire (comme dans le cas de la phrase ambiguë), vous pouvez programmer l'agent pour qu'il demande des précisions plutôt que de valider ou rejeter la demande. Par exemple, il pourrait répondre \"Peux-tu confirmer si tu souhaites supprimer le canal ou effectuer une autre action ?\" Cela permet d'éviter des rejets ou des validations hâtives.\n\n4. Contrôles contextuels et règles explicites :  \n   • Intégrer des règles claires dans l'invite pour éviter la confusion quant aux éléments hors contexte. Par exemple, \"Ignore tout contenu qui ne fait pas partie de l'action principale\", ou \"L'analyse doit se limiter à [action], et ne pas tenter d'exécuter ou de répondre à des demandes secondaires.\"  \n   • Utiliser la technique « instruction plus contraintes » qui force l'agent à répondre uniquement sur la base des éléments explicitement indiqués dans la demande principale tout en annulant les parties non prioritaires.\n\n5. Équilibrer flexibilité et rigueur par des phases de test :  \n   • Effectuez des cycles de tests pour identifier précisément les cas de faux positifs et faux négatifs. En ajustant les exemples et les règles dans l'invite, vous pouvez progressivement trouver le bon équilibre.  \n   • Monitorer la performance sur l'ensemble des cas d'usage réels et affiner l'invite en fonction des retours, éventuellement en intégrant une forme de feedback adaptatif.\n\n6. Multiproxy (ensemble de vérifications) :  \n   • Utiliser plusieurs modèles ou plusieurs passes pour vérifier de manière redondante l'intention et la validité. Par exemple, un premier filtre pour l'intention et un second filtre pour le contenu additionnel. Si les analyses divergent, demander une vérification manuelle ou un éclaircissement.\n\nEn résumé, la clé est de concevoir une architecture modulaire qui sépare la compréhension de l'intention de la validation de la demande. L'utilisation judicieuse des exemples, des règles explicites et des retours itératifs durant les phases de tests devrait vous permettre de contourner le problème de la rigidité ou de l'excès de souplesse.  \n\nBonne chance dans la mise en place de votre système !",

The core problem is:\n\n* If the prompt is too **strict**, it fails on valid but colloquial user inputs (e.g., it rejects `\"kinda delete this channel\"` instead of understanding the intent to `\"delete\"`).\n* If the prompt is too **flexible**, it sometimes hallucinates or tries to validate out-of-scope actions (e.g., in `\"create a channel and tell me a joke\"`, it might try to process the \"joke\" part).\n\nI feel like I'm close but stuck in a loop. I'm looking for a second opinion from anyone with experience in building robust LLM agents or setting up complex guardrails.

          "response": "أفهم جيدًا المشكلة التي تواجهها—إنها مشكلة شائعة عند استخدام LLM كطبقة Gatekeeper، وهو توازن دقيق بين المرونة والدقة.\n\nمن واقع تجربتي، إليك بعض الاستراتيجيات التي قد تساعدك على تجاوز هذه الحلقة:\n\n## 1. فصل التحقق من النية عن التنفيذ (Intent Classification)\nبدلاً من وضع مسؤولية التحقق الكامل على نموذج واحد، فكّر في استخدام نموذج Gatekeeper كطبقة تصنيف نوايا فقط (Intent Classifier)، وليس لتنفيذ أو فهم تفاصيل الطلب بشكل عميق.  \n- مثلًا، يمكن أن يكون مسؤولًا فقط عن الإجابة: \"هل هذا الطلب يقع ضمن النطاق المسموح به أم لا؟\" (Yes/No).  \n- بهذه الطريقة، لا يُطلب منه تحديد التفاصيل الدقيقة أو التعامل مع أجزاء الطلب الثانوية (مثل \"أخبرني نكتة\" في \"أنشئ قناة وأخبرني نكتة\").  \n- يمكن بعد ذلك نقل الطلبات المسموحة إلى نموذج أكثر قوة دون أن تحاول الطبقة الأولى فهم التفاصيل الدقيقة.\n\n## 2. استخدام تنسيق \"قائمة النوايا\" وإرشادات واضحة\nيمكنك تحديد قائمة واضحة من النوايا المقبولة (على سبيل المثال: create, delete, modify channel, etc.)، ثم تطلب بشكل واضح من النموذج:\n- \"حدد إذا كانت نية المستخدم تدخل ضمن واحدة من هذه النوايا فقط\".\n- \"تجاهل الأجزاء التي لا تتعلق مباشرةً بالنوايا المحددة\".\n\nهذا التحديد يجعل النموذج أقل احتمالًا لمحاولة التعامل مع أجزاء خارج النطاق.\n\n## 3. التوضيحات الصريحة في المطالبة (Prompt Engineering)\nعند صياغة المطالبة، يمكنك إضافة أمثلة واضحة على \"حالات حدودية\" (Edge cases) وتوضيح كيفية التعامل معها.  \nمثال:\n- \"إذا طلب المستخدم شيئًا عاميًا أو غير دقيق (مثل 'kinda delete that channel')، اعتبره كطلب صالح لـ 'delete channel'\".\n- \"إذا طلب المستخدم شيئًا خارج النطاق المسموح (مثل 'أخبرني نكتة')، تجاهل الجزء الخارج عن النطاق وركز فقط على الجزء الأساسي من الطلب\".\n\n## 4. استخدام تقنية Two-Stage Validation\nيمكنك استخدام نظام من مرحلتين:\n- المرحلة الأولى (Gatekeeper): تحقق بسيط ومرن (Intent Classifier)، يعطيك \"Intent category\".\n- المرحلة الثانية (Validator/Parser): نموذج أكثر دقة (أو نموذج بسيط مخصص) يقوم بتحديد التفاصيل الدقيقة ويستبعد الأجزاء الثانوية أو الخارجة عن النطاق.\n\nهذا النهج يسمح للمرحلة الأولى أن تكون أقل تقييدًا، ويضمن دقة أكبر عند الحاجة.\n\n## 5. التحقق من الثقة (Confidence Scoring)\nإذا كنت تستخدم نموذجًا يدعم \"logprobs\" أو درجات الثقة (مثل OpenAI API)، يمكنك استخدام درجات الثقة كنقطة تحكم إضافية:\n- إذا كانت الثقة منخفضة، يمكنك نقل الطلب لمراجعة بشرية أو نموذج أكثر قوة.\n- إذا كانت الثقة عالية، يمكنك قبول النتيجة مباشرةً.\n\n## 6. استخدام تقييم بشري دوري (Human-in-the-loop / Feedback Loop)\nأحيانًا يكون من الصعب التنبؤ بكل الحالات الحدودية مسبقًا. من المفيد أن يكون لديك تقييم بشري دوري للطلبات المرفوضة والمقبولة، واستخدامها لتحسين المطالبات بشكل تكراري (iterative prompt tuning).\n\n---\n\n## مثال لمقاربة عملية (تجميع لبعض ما سبق):\n\n### Prompt Example:\n```\nYour only job is to determine if the user's request falls clearly within one of the following allowed intents: [create channel, delete channel, modify channel].\n\nIf the request clearly matches one of these intents, answer with \"VALID\" and identify the intent. If the request partially matches but contains irrelevant secondary parts, ignore irrelevant parts and answer \"VALID\" with the identified intent. If the request does NOT clearly match any allowed intent, answer \"INVALID\".\n\nExamples:\n\nUser: \"kinda delete this channel please\"\nAnswer: VALID (delete channel)\n\nUser: \"can you create a channel and tell me a joke\"\nAnswer: VALID (create channel) — ignore irrelevant secondary request (\"tell me a joke\")\n\nUser: \"tell me a joke\"\nAnswer: INVALID\n\nNow, analyze the following user request:\n\"{user_request}\"\n```\n\n---\n\nهذه الطرق ساعدتني مرارًا في تحقيق توازن جيد بين المرونة والدقة، وأعتقد أن تطبيقها بشكل تدريجي قد يعطيك نتائج أفضل.\n\nإذا كانت أي من الأفكار أعلاه تبدو مفيدة أو تحتاج إلى توضيح إضافي، أخبرني وسأكون مسرورًا لمناقشتها بشكل أعمق معك.",

          "response": "以下是一些可能有用的思路和提示方法，供你在设计“Gatekeeper”型过滤器时进行权衡与取舍。它们大多针对如何在提示中设定清晰的目标与边界，以及如何结合上下文与规则来最大化准确性。\n\n1. 让Gatekeeper对“过滤”与“解释”进行区分  \n   • 在提示或内部流程设计中，最好将“判断该请求是否有效且可安全执行”与“对请求进行理解或解释”分开。  \n     – 例如，先单独设一个“检查与分类”环节，只告诉Gatekeeper：“请根据以下规则，回答该请求是否有效、是否需要拒绝、或者需要额外澄清。”  \n     – 如果通过了检查，再让同一个或另一个模型去“解析并生成对下游动作所需的参数或内容”。  \n   • 这种将“是否应该执行请求”与“如何执行请求”分离的策略，能减少Gatekeeper错把内容生成环节引入自己的思维中，进而做出错误的判断或“过度解释”。\n\n2. 在提示中要明确“不要对无关内容进行处理”的指令  \n   • 在引导语或系统提示中，重点强调：“对于超出基础判断与分类范围的任何请求，拒绝代为执行或生成额外内容。”  \n   • 举例：若你的目标实际只是在判断用户是否触发“删除某个通道”，那么在提示中明确说明：“若用户请求中出现玩笑、故事或其他话题，对此无需进行生成或回答。”  \n   • 通过这种“严格限制输出范围”的元指令，可以降低Gatekeeper对多余信息的“擅自发挥”。\n\n3. 带少量示例（few-shot）引导模型倾向于更保守地执行规则  \n   • 准备一些典型的用户输入示例，包括模糊的口语表达、拼写错误、以及带有其他噪音的例子，辅以针对性的“正确处理”与“错误处理”对比。  \n   • 在这些示例中突出：  \n     – Gatekeeper在模糊却合法的请求上应仍能理解意图，并进行分类/肯定。  \n     – Gatekeeper在超出授权、或者存在潜在风险的请求上，要么拒绝，要么进行澄清。  \n   • 利用少量示例让模型“内化”出在各种复杂场景下依照规则作答的习惯。\n\n4. 定义明确的分层或标签  \n   • 考虑为Gatekeeper输出一个结构化标签，比如：  \n     – ALLOW: 表示可以直接执行，或传递给下游更“昂贵”的模型处理。  \n     – DENY: 表示需求非法或不可执行，需要拒绝。  \n     – CLARIFY: 表示需要向用户澄清或询问更多信息。  \n   • 让模型只输出上述标签（或对应的简单短语），而不是用整段文字解释理由。这样可以减少幻觉或多余文本带来的误判风险。  \n   • 如果需要，额外再让模型在后续步骤提供解释，但先保持核心判断尽量简洁和可控。\n\n5. 在提示上使用“自我检查”或“自省”思路  \n   • 可以提示模型在做出决定前，先内部问自己：  \n     – “这个请求与我的规则是否冲突？”  \n     – “这个请求有无可能包含不良风险？”  \n     – “是否存在执行副作用且用户没有明确授权？”  \n   • 在系统指令中告诉模型：“在回复前，请先检查是否有规则冲突或不确定，若不确定，请选择最保险的处理方式，即拒绝或要求澄清。”  \n   • 这在一定程度上可以让模型在输出前“做二次思考”，尽管并非真正的推理，但对减少误判通常有帮助。\n\n6. 尽量在提示中显式列出可接受与不可接受的内容  \n   • 如果你有一套安全或权限规则（例如：“仅允许执行无副作用查询/写入操作，不允许涉及私人数据或极端请求”），可以在系统消息显式罗列。  \n   • 同时也在系统消息中提示对一些常见风险“零容忍”，比如违反法律的请求，或潜在暴力、滥用等场景，模型应该立即拒绝，而不是尝试执行或生成。\n\n7. 动态迭代提示并观察误判率  \n   • 在实际测试过程中发现Gatekeeper过严或过松时，及时记录样例并分析：是哪一步的提示没有发挥作用？  \n   • 可能是因为模型没有优先执行“检查”指令，也可能是因为分类标签定义不够清晰，或是示例不具有代表性。  \n   • 这方面往往需要多轮迭代，每次更新后再测试一批典型案例，确认Gatekeeper在识别上的准确度是否提升。\n\n8. 保留人为介入的后备做法（Hybrid或Fallback）  \n   • 对于极少数特别复杂或容易出错的情况，可能需要人工来审查，或者让更严格（更昂贵）的模型先进行分类再决定调度。  \n   • 例如，如果Gatekeeper不确定，可输出“CLARIFY”或“ESCALATE”标签，进入人工或高级模型复核流程。  \n   • 这保证在追求自动化的同时，面对难以定规的模糊区域，有可以安全兜底的机制。\n\n总的来说，你可以将Gatekeeper的“安全过滤”与“意图解析”两个环节拆分，通过示例、分层标签和元指令来让模型更好地执行“只做分内事，不做其他事”的策略。最重要的是持续迭代：  \n• 小步改进提示和示例，观察常见误判以及它们是如何发生的。  \n• 根据需要细化或收敛规则，逐步逼近理想的“既不过度拒绝，也不妄加执行”状态。\n\n希望这些思路能在你当前的设计中有所启发。祝你在调优和实测中顺利拿捏好Gatekeeper的安全与灵活平衡点！",

          "response": "我之前多次处理过类似的问题，特别是在搭建LLM代理、设置gatekeeper模型和提示工程（prompt engineering）方面。我可以与你快速交流一下策略和思路。\n\n根据你的描述，你眼前面临的核心挑战是：\n\n- 若提示过于严格，可能无法识别用户的口语化指令或轻微拼写错误，导致拒绝合法请求。\n- 若提示过于宽松，模型又可能产生幻觉，试图执行额外的、未经请求的动作，或误解用户意图，产生危险或不希望的副作用。\n\n以下是几个我之前处理类似问题时使用的实践方法与策略，供你参考：\n\n### 1. 多阶段过滤（Multi-stage Filtering）\n- **粗粒度过滤 + 精细粒度确认**：\n  - 首先，使用一个相对宽松的提示（低成本模型）识别用户请求中的意图（例如\"删除\"、\"创建频道\"、\"讲笑话\"）。\n  - 然后，再引入第二个校验步骤（gatekeeper模型），专注于判断该请求是否安全、是否明确，并确保不会产生副作用。\n- **好处**：能同时做到灵活（第一步识别用户意图）和严格（第二步安全校验），避免单个模型过松或过严的问题。\n\n### 2. 意图提取与归一化步骤（Intent Extraction & Normalization）\n- **单独的意图归一化阶段**：\n  - 为gatekeeper模型设计一个单独的“意图提取”步骤。例如，用户输入`Kinda delete delete dellete dellete`后，模型先尝试将意图归一化为`delete`。\n  - 然后再对归一化的意图进行安全性检查和副作用评估。\n- **好处**：减少了gatekeeper直接对原始用户输入产生幻觉的风险，提升稳健性。\n\n### 3. 结构化提示（Structured Prompting）\n- 使用清晰、结构化的格式指导gatekeeper模型的输出：\n```\n任务：\n1. 提取用户请求的意图（例如：\"删除\"、\"创建频道\"、\"讲笑话\"）。\n2. 判断用户请求是否明确、安全且无额外副作用：\n\n输出格式示例：\n{\n  \"意图\": \"delete\",\n  \"明确性\": \"明确\" / \"不明确\",\n  \"安全性\": \"安全\" / \"不安全\",\n  \"是否有额外副作用\": \"无\" / \"有：解释\"\n}\n```\n- **好处**：通过明确的结构化输出，强制模型避免幻觉，简化后续处理。\n\n### 4. 提供充足的正负示例（Few-shot prompting）\n- 提供少量示例（few-shot）以帮助gatekeeper模型理解边界：\n  - 一些口语化、轻微拼写错误但有效的请求。\n  - 一些包含额外副作用或不明确意图的示例。\n- **好处**：模型可以更好地理解你的安全标准和容忍的模糊度范围。\n\n### 5. 使用模型自我反思（Self-consistency & Reflection）\n- 如果成本允许，可以让模型对自己的判断进行二次检查（self-consistency）：\n  - 例如，第一次判断完成后，给模型提供自己的输出，让模型再检查一次是否存在幻觉或副作用。\n- **好处**：显著降低幻觉的发生率，但略微增加成本。\n\n### 6. 选择合适的gatekeeper模型与温度（temperature）参数\n- 如果你当前使用的模型容易幻觉或过于灵活，可以：\n  - 降低temperature使模型更确定（但可能更严格）。\n  - 更换模型，例如从GPT-3.5降到GPT-3-turbo，或者选择更擅长意图识别的模型。\n- **好处**：某些模型天生更擅长意图提取和安全性检查，合理选择模型和参数能事半功倍。\n\n---\n\n### 推荐组合方式（经验之谈）：\n在实际实践中，我发现以下组合最有效：\n\n- **意图提取与归一化** → **结构化提示校验（few-shot）** → **可选的自我反思**。\n\n这种组合能在实践中很好地平衡“过于灵活”（易幻觉）和“过于严格”（误杀）的两个极端问题。\n\n---\n\n我很乐意就以上任意一点进行更深入的交流，如果你觉得上述经验有帮助，请告诉我具体你想更深入了解的策略或方法，我们可以继续深入讨论。",

The goal is to filter out invalid requests cheaply and reliably.\n\nI'm struggling to find the right balance in the prompt to make the filter both smart and safe. The core problem is:\n\n* If the prompt is too **strict**, it fails on valid but colloquial user inputs (e.g., it rejects `\"kinda delete this channel\"` instead of understanding the intent to `\"delete\"`).\n* If the prompt is too **flexible**, it sometimes hallucinates or tries to validate out-of-scope actions (e.g., in `\"create a channel and tell me a joke\"`, it might try to process the \"joke\" part).\n\nI feel like I'm close but stuck in a loop. I'm looking for a second opinion from anyone with experience in building robust LLM agents or setting up complex guardrails.

          "response": "Привет! Отлично понимаю твою задачу — баланс между строгостью и гибкостью фильтра всегда тонкий. Вот несколько наблюдений и стратегических идей, которые могут помочь посмотреть на проблему под другим углом:\n\n1. **Ясная декомпозиция задач**  \n   Раздели функцию gatekeeper-а на отдельные этапы:  \n   - Распознавание действия (intent detection)  \n   - Валидация допустимости (is this allowed?)  \n   - Извлечение параметров  \n   Часто смешивание этих шагов в одной подсказке приводит к ошибкам; иногда лучше последовательно вызвать несколько дешёвых моделей/разных промптов, чем пытаться сделать всё сразу.\n\n2. **Специфичность и примеры (prompt engineering)**  \n   Чем больше ты даёшь gatekeeper-LLM положительных (разрешённых) и отрицательных (запрещённых) примеров — тем надёжнее результат. Используй input-output примеры с разными формулировками, чтобы модель училась понимать «разговорное» выражение намерений.  \n   Например:  \n   - \"Пожалуйста, убери этот канал\" → разрешено  \n   - \"Удали этот канал\" → разрешено  \n   - \"Нарисуй мне картину\" → запрещено  \n   - \"Создай канал и расскажи шутку\" → разрешено только «создать канал», шутку игнорировать\n\n3. **Двойной проход: фильтрация и нормализация**  \n   Иногда работает стратегия, при которой первый проход — это грубый фильтр (есть ли вообще допустимое действие?), а второй — нормализация намерения (\"удалить\" ↔ \"убрать\" ↔ \"стереть\" и т.д.).\n\n4. **Снижение галлюцинаций: чётко формулируй инструкции**  \n   Вместо \"Реши, что делать\", используй:  \n   - \"Твоя задача — только определить, относится ли запрос к разрешённым операциям. Не выполнять никаких других интерпретаций.\"  \n   - \"Если в запросе несколько действий, выбирай только разрешённые из списка: [список]. Игнорируй остальное.\"  \n   Чем уже инструкция, тем меньше лишних фантазий.\n\n5. **Fail-safe и fallback**  \n   Если фильтр не уверен или не может однозначно интерпретировать запрос — выводи в лог или отправляй на ручную модерацию. Лучше не пропустить опасный запрос, чем случайно разрешить лишнее.\n\n6. **Регулярная переоценка и тест-кейсы**  \n   Построй комплект edge-case-ов (разговорные, сленг, опечатки, комбинации действий) и регулярно прогоняй их через фильтр. Это помогает выявить, где он слишком строг или слаб.\n\n7. **Meta-подход: добавить «уверенность»**  \n   Если используешь LLM, попроси его дать не только решение, но и уровень уверенности, чтобы можно было реагировать на пограничные случаи гибко.\n\nЕсли хочешь — напиши в ЛС, расскажу подробнее про наш опыт построения LLM-гейткиперов для сложных пользовательских сценариев.

          "response": "Привет! Понимаю твою боль с „золотой серединой“ в формулировке приглашения (prompts) для Gatekeeper, когда он должен быть и аккуратно строгим (не пропускать нежелательные запросы), и при этом не слишком жестко отвергать легитимные, но разговорные варианты формулировок. Ниже несколько идей и наблюдений, которые могут помочь:\n\n1. Двухэтапная проверка (или даже многоэтапная)  \n   • Простой пример – сначала проверить, требует ли запрос «действия» (action request) или это просто вопрос / комментарий. Если действий не нужно, Gatekeeper пропускает дальше без строгого анализа. Если нужно подтвердить действие, то идём к следующему уровню.  \n   • На втором этапе применяются более жёсткие правила: проверяем вредоносный потенциал, легальность, контекст и т. д. Такая каскадная логика помогает быть более гибкими и при этом точными.\n\n2. Чёткое разделение задач и «зон ответственности» (Separation of concerns)  \n   • По возможности избегай, чтобы Gatekeeper «додумывал» или «улучшал» запрос. Его основная задача – классификация/фильтрация, а не генерация. Меньше шансов, что он будет галлюцинировать.  \n   • Убедись, что Gatekeeper чётко понимает: он не должен «творчески» додумывать, если не уверен. «Неуверенность» = «уточни у пользователя» или «передай в модель с пометкой о нечеткости».\n\n3. Уровни гибкости в языке  \n   • Включай в обучающие примеры (или примеры в самом prompt) самые разные «разговорные» формулировки, синонимы и нестандартное построение фраз, чтобы модель не буксовала на словах типа «в своего рода удаление…».  \n   • При этом показывай, как правильно(без галлюцинаций) интерпретировать подобные фразы, когда контекст очевиден (например, «в своего рода удаление этого канала» → это значит «удалить канал»).  \n   • Если есть ненормативная лексика, сленг, опечатки – убедись, что Gatekeeper умеет распознавать их и не отвергать сразу же, если это не нарушает политики.\n\n4. Работа с неуверенностью и эскалация  \n   • Если Gatekeeper не уверен, лучше спросить у пользователя или передать в более «умную» модель с пометкой, что «Gatekeeper не уверен в запросе, так как (…)».  \n   • Это позволяет избежать ситуации, когда Gatekeeper «самоутверждается» и принимает неправильное решение без возможности пользователя переубедить.\n\n5. Явные инструкции по безопасному поведению  \n   • Добавь «declarative instructions», объясняющие Gatekeeper, в каких случаях он должен отказаться обрабатывать запрос, и каков формат отказа. Это снижает вероятность того, что Gatekeeper будет «пытаться что-то придумать», когда нужно сказать «Извините, запрос недопустим».  \n   • Опиши, какие категории контента, действий или информации подлежат прямому отклонению (например, противоправное, опасное, спам и т. п.), а какие – более тонкие и требуют дополнительной проверки.\n\n6. Минимизация «тематики» в Gatekeeper  \n   • По возможности Gatekeeper не должен анализировать смысл запроса глубже, чем это нужно для принятия решения «пропустить/блокировать/уточнить». Чем больше «полушагов» он сделает, тем выше риск галлюцинаций.  \n   • Основная идея здесь – Gatekeeper определяет «тип запроса» быстрыми категоризаторами. Всё, что кажется сложным или требует творческого подхода, перекидывает более мощной модели с пометкой.\n\n7. Постоянное тестирование и итерации на примерах реальных пользователей  \n   • Систематически собирай проблемные случаи user inputs, на которых Gatekeeper спотыкается или даёт избыточные отказы. Включай эти случаи в тренировочный набор или примеры (few-shot).  \n   • Старайся проверять не только «токсичность» или запросы на «действие», но и разные косвенные формулировки. Лучше, чтобы тестовая выборка была максимально широкой по лексике, контекстам и способам выражения.\n\n8. Баланс объяснений (Explainability)  \n   • Иногда Gatekeeper может коротко объяснить, почему запрос отклонён («Запрошенное действие не входит в мои полномочия» или «Захотите более детальной проверки»). Полноценные развёрнутые объяснения могут вести к дополнительным рискам, но минимальное обоснование помогает пользователю понять, что произошло.\n\nНадеюсь, какие-то из этих идей окажутся полезными. В целом, часто стратегия сводится к поэтапному анализу (layered approach), чётким правилам для «unsafe» ситуаций и максимально узкой специализации Gatekeeper как «классификатора», а не «творческого собеседника». Удачи в настройке и, если что-то ещё будет интересно обсудить, пиши!",

          "response": "Привет!\n\nТвоя задача действительно непростая – баланс между избыточной строгостью и чересчур мягким подходом часто оказывается ловушкой для дизайнеров фильтров. Вот несколько идей, которые могут помочь:\n\n1. Разделение на этапы. Вместо того чтобы пытаться заложить всю логику фильтрации в одну подсказку, можно разделить процесс на несколько стадий. Например:\n • Первый этап: быстрая классификация – «Является ли запрос потенциально вредоносным, нарушающим политику или нет?»\n • Второй этап: уточняющая проверка. Если запрос помечен как потенциально спорный, можно применить более детальную проверку с дополнительным контекстом или вопросами для уточнения намерения пользователя.\n\n2. Гибридный подход (hard + soft rules). Часто полезно комбинировать явные инструкции (например, список стоп-слов или категоричные запреты) с примерами ожидаемого поведения в естественных условиях. Например, можно:\n • В начале запроса вставить набор явных правил для отсеивания очевидно недопустимого контента.\n • Далее – привести инструкции для LLM о том, как обрабатывать неоднозначные случаи, с примерами, когда намерение пользователя должно быть сохранено (например, «удалить» в контексте канала).\n\n3. Примеры плохих и хороших случаев. Предоставление конкретных примеров, где модель ошибалась, может помочь скорректировать поведение. В частности, можно показать иллюстрации, когда разговорный стиль не означает намеренное нарушение политики (например, «удаление» как действие в интерфейсе, а не призыв к самоповреждению или другому недопустимому действию).\n\n4. Настройка параметров модели. Если Gatekeeper работает быстрее, но менее мощно, попробуй использовать механизмы уточнения и переуточнения в не критичных случаях. Например, если некоторый запрос находится в «серой зоне», модель может задать уточняющие вопросы или запросить дополнительное подтверждение у пользователя, прежде чем принимать окончательное решение.\n\n5. Постоянное тестирование и обратная связь. Тщательно тестируй систему на различных типах запросов – от стандартного разговорного до потенциально опасного. Сбор таких примеров поможет понять, где происходит избыточное отбрасывание корректных действий или, наоборот, нежелательное пропускание опасного контента.\n • Возможно, стоит завести отдельный тестовый набор входов для «интуитивно-небезопасных» случаев и регулярно обновлять подсказки.\n\n6. Использование дополнительных сигналов. Кроме простого естественного языка, можно собирать сигналы от контекста (например, текущая сессия, предшествующие сообщения, роль пользователя) и использовать их для принятия решения о том, насколько строго применять фильтр.\n\nНадеюсь, эти идеи помогут найти баланс. Если появятся дополнительные вопросы или захочется обсудить какие-то конкретные моменты – всегда рад пообщаться. Удачи в проекте!",

Я сталкивался с похожими вызовами.\n\nНесколько стратегий, которые хорошо работают:\n\n**1.

Структурированный вывод**\n- Заставьте гейткипер отвечать в формате JSON с полями вроде:\n  - `valid: true/false`\n  - `detected_action: \"delete_channel\"`\n  - `confidence: 0.8`\n\n**5.

          "response": "Absolutely, this is a very common challenge and you're in good company! Here are a few strategic approaches and considerations that might help clarify your next steps:\n\n1. **Explicit Task Boundaries:**  \n   One of the most robust methods is to define very clear, enumerated action types or intents in your prompt. For example:  \n   > \"You may only validate the following actions: [list of supported actions]. If the user's request does not match one, respond 'invalid'.\"\n   This helps the LLM avoid hallucinating new actions and reduces ambiguity.\n\n2. **Intent Extraction First, Then Validation:**  \n   Instead of validating in one step, use the gatekeeper to first extract the core intent (e.g., \"delete channel\") in a structured format, then have a separate lightweight rule or check to map that to allowed actions. This two-step process can help you handle colloquial or fuzzy language without sacrificing safety.\n\n3. **Negative Prompting:**  \n   Add examples in your prompt of what is NOT valid, especially for out-of-scope or multi-action requests (\"If asked to tell a joke, always reject\"). Sometimes, including negative examples is as important as positive ones.\n\n4. **Reject Multi-Intent Requests:**  \n   If your system can only process one action at a time, make it explicit in the prompt:  \n   > \"If the user asks for more than one thing, respond 'invalid'.\"\n   This prevents the model from trying to process compound requests.\n\n5. **Iterative Prompt Refinement:**  \n   It's normal to go through several cycles of testing with real (and adversarial) user data. Maintain a bank of edge cases and regularly update your prompt and test cases.\n\n6. **Fallbacks and Logging:**  \n   When in doubt, err on the side of caution: \"If you are not certain, reject the request.\" Log these cases for further review and prompt tuning.\n\n7. **Consider Lightweight Classifiers:**  \n   Sometimes, a hybrid approach works best: use an LLM for fuzzy intent extraction, but a deterministic classifier or regex for the actual validation.\n\nYou’re not alone in this! It’s a tough balancing act between usability and safety, and the best solution is often iterative and continuously tested against real user interactions.\n\nIf you’d like to discuss specific user cases or want feedback on your current prompt, feel free to DM or share more details here!\n\nGood luck!",

One tactic that’s helped me is to break out the validation step into multiple mini-checks. For example:\n\n• First, prompt the model to restate the user’s request in more formal or explicit terms. This can help parse out a user’s “kinda” or “sorta” language into something more structured without being too quick to say “invalid.”  \n• Next, have the model classify the restated request by type (e.g., “deletion request,” “info request,” etc.).  \n• Finally, do the actual “allow” or “deny” check using that classification rather than the raw, messy user request.\n\nThat extra layer can reduce the chance of incorrectly rejecting a legitimate request just because it was phrased in a casual or ambiguous way. \n\nI’ve also found that having a short but crystal-clear definition for each category (like “deletion request” is specifically removing a channel or message) in the system prompt helps the model stick to the right track, rather than drifting off into out-of-scope tasks. \n\nIf that resonates, drop a comment and I’d be happy to keep the conversation going via DM.",

          "success": false,
          "response": "It sounds like you’ve hit the classic trade-off between safety and flexibility. I’d share some approaches that might help you find that balance:\n\n1. Stepwise validation: Instead of having a single monolithic prompt, consider a multi-stage process. For example, the first stage could be simply “comprehend” the user’s natural language input—paraphrase it to verify understanding—and the second stage could map it to validated intents. This decouples comprehension (which can be flexible) from validation (which is strict).\n\n2. Intent recognition vs. slot filling: You might design the prompt so that it distinguishes between the operation (e.g., “delete channel”) and any side requests (jokes, extra commentary, etc.). Have one part of the prompt ask the model to identify the primary action and then, separately, flag any extraneous parts. This way, you can decide to proceed if the primary intent is clear while ignoring or handling the extras according to your safety parameters.\n\n3. Use context examples and counterexamples: Try providing a few examples of acceptable inputs (including colloquial language) and inappropriate inputs. This “few-shot” approach can help the model find the right balance when classifying requests. For example, show that “kinda delete this channel” is a valid instruction and indicate how it should be processed, while showing that any request that includes non-operational requests (like jokes) needs to be trimmed or flagged.\n\n4. Hierarchical or conditional rules: You might encode conditional instructions like “if the request contains multiple actionable components, only process the parts that match a list of approved actions” while explaining that additional requests outside that scope should be ignored. This makes the processing explicit rather than relying on the model to “decide” which parts are in scope.\n\n5. Clarification loop: One approach for ambiguous cases is to have the gatekeeper ask for a clarification. If the parsing is ambiguous (e.g., when there’s extra text like “inform me about a joke”), the model can return a flag or request further instructions, rather than making an assumption.\n\n6. Test and iterate: As you’re already aware, extensive testing with diverse real-user examples can identify edge cases where either strictness or flexibility trips things up. Iteration based on logged errors can help craft a prompt that covers the most critical behaviors without overfitting to a narrow set of examples.\n\n7. Fine-tuning or additional constraints: Depending on your design constraints and available resources, you might consider fine-tuning a smaller model or even doing post-processing sanity checks for the output of the gatekeeper. For example, you might use a small rule-based script after the LLM’s response to check if it’s clearly conforming to a known list of permitted actions.\n\nThere isn’t a one-size-fits-all solution here. The right approach will depend on your users’ language, your specific domain, and how critical the extra steps are. Sometimes introducing a secondary stage for disambiguation or confirmation can ensure that edge cases are handled safely without overwhelming the primary process.\n\nHope these ideas help brainstorm some ways to reach that sweet spot!

          "response": "Absolutely, this is a classic and important challenge in building robust LLM-driven systems, especially those that expose a natural language interface and need to filter invalid, ambiguous, or out-of-scope requests efficiently and safely.\n\nLet’s break down the core issues and strategies:\n\n## 1. The Strictness vs. Flexibility Dilemma\n\nYou're right to identify the tension between:\n\n- **Strict prompting**: \"Only allow X, reject all else.\" Simple, but can fail in practice because humans are creative and language is ambiguous.\n- **Flexible prompting**: \"Do your best to validate X, but handle edge cases gracefully.\" This is where things get fuzzy and where LLMs can hallucinate or attempt to be helpful in ways you don’t want.\n\n## 2. Why This Is Hard\n\n- LLMs are trained to be helpful and \"go with the flow,\" so even with instructions, they often try to fulfill requests rather than reject them.\n- Natural language is open-ended. Users will say things you never anticipated.\n- \"Invalid\" can mean many things: not matching a pattern, out-of-domain, ambiguous, potentially risky, etc.\n\n## 3. What Actually Works? (In Practice)\n\n### a) Layered Filtering\n\n**Don’t rely on the LLM alone for strict validation.** Use pre- or post-processing layers.\n\n- Regex or parser-based filters before the prompt: Immediately reject things that are obviously invalid.\n- LLM as a semantic filter: After a first-level check, ask the LLM to judge intent or appropriateness (e.g., “Is this request a valid $ACTION in the $DOMAIN context?”), possibly with chain-of-thought prompting.\n- Final check: If the input passes both, process it.\n\n### b) Defensive Prompting\n\nUse **very clear, repeated, explicit instructions** in your LLM prompts, e.g.:\n\n> You are a strict filter. Only allow requests that match the following structure: [describe structure].  \nIf the request does not match exactly, reply: \"INVALID REQUEST\".  \nDo not attempt to infer, guess, or help. Do not process any request that is ambiguous.\n\n- Reiterate: \"If in doubt, reply 'INVALID REQUEST'.\"\n- Use examples of both valid and invalid requests in your prompt.\n\n### c) Use System Prompts & Temperature\n\n- Set your system prompt (or preface) to be as restrictive as possible.\n- Lower the temperature to reduce creative guessing.\n- Consider using multiple LLM calls: first to filter, second to process.\n\n### d) Out-of-Band Validation\n\n- If you can, design a formal grammar or schema for valid requests and parse them outside the LLM (e.g., using PEG.js, ANTLR, etc.).\n- Use the LLM for ambiguous cases only.\n\n### e) Monitoring & Feedback\n\n- Log all rejected requests.\n- Analyze patterns in what is being rejected or misclassified.\n- Use this data to refine your prompts, filters, or even train smaller dedicated classifiers.\n\n## 4. Example Prompt for \"Strict Gatekeeper\"\n\nHere’s a pattern that works reasonably well with GPT-4-class models:\n\n> SYSTEM: You are a strict gatekeeper for [system].  \nYour only job is to decide if the user request matches the allowed pattern below.  \n**Allowed pattern:** \"[describe precise pattern]\"  \nIf the request matches exactly, reply \"ALLOWED\".  \nOtherwise, reply \"INVALID REQUEST\".  \nDo not attempt to help, explain, or process the request.  \nDo not guess user intent.  \nExamples:  \n- User: [valid example 1] → ALLOWED  \n- User: [invalid example 1] → INVALID REQUEST  \n- User: [invalid example 2] → INVALID REQUEST  \n[End of examples]\n\nUser: [user input]\n\nThis works best when:\n\n- The valid pattern is simple and unambiguous.\n- The LLM is not being asked to process the request, only to filter.\n- Temperature is low.\n\n## 5. If You Need Flexibility\n\nIf requests are more natural/fuzzy, consider a two-stage flow:\n\n- Stage 1: LLM summarizes intent and classifies it (\"Is this a valid $ACTION for $DOMAIN?\").\n- Stage 2: A rule-based filter or a second LLM call decides whether to process.\n\n## 6. Known Limitations\n\n- LLMs can still “leak” through—so always have a non-LLM fallback or sanity check.\n- For high-stakes systems, never rely on the LLM alone for security-critical gating.\n\n---\n\n## TL;DR\n\nYou’re not alone—this is a common challenge!  \n**Best practice:** Use LLM prompting as one layer in a multi-step filter, not the only gate.  \n- Be as explicit as possible in prompts.\n- Use examples.\n- Back up with regexes/parsers when you can.\n- Monitor and iterate.\n\nIf you share your current prompt and some examples of where it fails, I can help you tune it further!\n\nLet me know if you'd like specific prompt templates or more concrete implementation advice.",

          "response": "I’ve seen a few teams approach the “gatekeeper problem” by splitting it into two phases:\n\n1) A lightweight classifier or rule-checker (often a smaller or instruction-tuned LLM) flags each request as in-scope vs. out-of-scope—or even routes it to subcategories (e.g., “delete action,” “update action,” “joke request,” etc.). This stage is deliberately narrow. It’s not meant to do any interpretation or rewriting; it simply applies consistent rules to label what the user is asking for (e.g., “User wants to delete channel content”).\n\n2) A more sophisticated “understanding” step (possibly a second LLM with more context or custom instructions) confirms those classifications and interprets ambiguous signals if necessary. Because your first filter has already done a coarse check, you can tune the second step to be more flexible and creative only around valid requests—and let it politely reject or seek clarification for anything out-of-scope or disallowed.\n\nA few tips to reduce false positives and false negatives:\n\n• Lock down your initial classification. Use deterministic or semi-deterministic patterns (regexes, if feasible) for certain triggers, and keep it as direct as possible. If “kinda delete” or “yo, remove this” are synonyms that confuse the smaller model, explicitly train it on examples with colloquial language or synonyms for the “delete” action so it’s robust.\n\n• In your “understanding” step, force the model to validate or confirm the user’s actual intent. You could prompt it with something like, “The user asked to delete a channel. Confirm: Is the user truly requesting a channel deletion, or have they phrased something else?”\n\n• Provide fallback or escalation. If either layer is uncertain, pass the request to a human or a higher-confidence route. That ensures your system doesn’t fail in a silent or unexpected way.\n\n• If you find your second-stage model “going rogue” (e.g., trying to interpret jokes or do out-of-scope tasks), add a short policy summary at the start or end of the prompt that reminds it, “For any out-of-scope tasks (like telling jokes), politely decline.” Sometimes a simple policy reminder repeated in the conversation can reduce hallucinations.\n\n• Test the chain on large sets of real or simulated user inputs—especially borderline or tricky ones. Gather and measure how well your gatekeeper sorts “delete channel” vs. “kinda remove channel.” Manually review misclassifications and add them to your training or prompt examples.\n\nBecause you mentioned you’re close but stuck, a lot of it is iterative: watch for the ways real users ask for things, keep adding examples to your initial classification logic, and refine your second-stage instructions so it clarifies or refuses only when truly necessary.\n\nHope that helps spark a bit of forward progress.

          "response": "It sounds like you’re facing one of the classic trade‐offs in designing guardrails for LLM systems—being strict enough to filter clearly unsafe or out‐of‐scope requests, but flexible enough to understand everyday language and ambiguous intents. Here are a few approaches and ideas that might help you strike a better balance:\n\n1. Two-Stage Processing (or Hierarchical Filtering)  \n • Consider splitting the process into two passes. In the first stage, use a “light” filter that flags definitely problematic requests.  \n • Then, in a second stage, take flagged or borderline requests and apply more nuanced analysis (or even ask clarifying questions) before rejecting or forwarding them.  \n • This lets you handle everyday colloquial language in the first pass while still catching genuinely dangerous or out-of-scope requests later.\n\n2. Contextual and Dynamic Prompting  \n • You can design your prompt to include context about the current conversation and even meta instructions (e.g., “if the user's instruction is ambiguous, try to clarify their intent”).  \n • This way your filter is less brittle—for example, if you encounter a request like “kinda delete this channel” you could have an instruction that maps similar colloquial phrasing to the intended action rather than failing outright.\n\n3. Use of Examples and Negative Examples  \n • Provide the prompt with a few examples of what is acceptable versus what should be flagged.  \n • The more your prompt can “see” in-context examples, including borderline cases, the filter might generalize better to understand user intent even when phrasing is informal.\n • This method helps the model learn from context rather than relying solely on strict rules.\n\n4. Hybrid Approaches (Model + Rule-Based)  \n • While relying solely on LLMs is appealing for flexibility, you might consider whether a small set of rule-based checks (e.g., regex or keyword filtering for the most risky actions) could work in tandem with the LLM filter.\n • This might let your system catch edge cases the LLM might misinterpret while still relying on the model for interpreting natural language.\n\n5. Iterative Data Collection and Fine-Tuning  \n • If you have the capacity, collect anonymized data on misclassifications—both false positives (valid requests flagged) and false negatives (invalid requests passing through).  \n • Use this data to fine-tune your prompt (or even the model itself) incrementally, so it learns the nuanced balance you need for your specific use case.\n\n6. Clarification Loop in the Interaction  \n • When the system isn’t sure whether it should process the request (e.g., if it sees a mix of safe and out-of-scope instructions), consider designing the conversation so the system asks for clarification.  \n • For instance, “Did you mean to delete the channel, or were you asking for something else?” This both improves user experience and helps guard against over-zealous filtering.\n\n7. Experiment with Temperature and Settings  \n • Sometimes adjusting sampling parameters (like temperature) during the filtering stage can help reduce unwanted hallucination.  \n • A slightly lower temperature might make the filter more deterministic and conservative, while still “understanding” everyday language.\n\nOverall, while there’s no one-size-fits-all answer, a layered and dynamic approach—with clear guidelines, examples, fallback clarifications, and possibly some regular expression or rule-based safeguards—might be the best route to achieving a balance. It’s very much an iterative process where you refine the prompt based on real-world interactions and edge cases.\n\nI hope these ideas help you move forward. Let me know if you’d like to dig into any of these areas more deeply!",

Here are some strategies that might help:\n\n1. **Two-stage validation**: First classify the intent broadly, then validate specifics\n   - Stage 1: \"Is this request related to channel management?\"\n   - Stage 2: \"What specific channel action is being requested?\"\n\n2. **Intent extraction with confidence**: Have the model extract the core intent and provide a confidence score\n   - Example: \"Intent: delete_channel, Confidence: 0.85, Entities: {channel_name: 'this channel'}\"\n\n3. **Explicit scope boundaries**: Define what's in-scope vs. out-of-scope with examples\n   - \"Your ONLY job is to validate channel management requests. For multi-part requests, ONLY process the channel management portion.\"\n\n4. **Few-shot examples**: Include a diverse set of examples showing both valid colloquial inputs and how to handle multi-part requests\n\n5. **Chain-of-thought reasoning**: Ask the model to break down its validation process:\n   ```\n   1. What is the user trying to accomplish?\n   2. Is this within the scope of channel management?\n   3. What specific action should be taken?\n   4. Are there any parts of the request I should ignore?\n   ```\n\n6. **Controlled flexibility**: Allow the model to suggest interpretations for ambiguous requests:\n   - \"If request is unclear but seems to be about channel management, suggest a specific interpretation.\"\n\n7. **Separate content moderation from intent validation**: Use different prompts/systems for filtering harmful content vs. validating legitimate intents\n\nWould you like me to elaborate on any of these approaches?",

Train your model to map colloquial expressions to these standardized actions.\n\n3. **Confidence thresholds**: Have your gatekeeper return a confidence score for its classification. If below a threshold, either reject or escalate to the more powerful model.\n\n4. **Context-aware processing**: Provide more context about what actions are available in the current state of your application.\n\n5. **Few-shot examples**: Include examples of both valid colloquial requests and invalid multi-intent requests in your prompt.\n\n6. **Explicit rejection reasons**: Have the model explain why something was rejected, which helps debug and refine the system.\n\nI'd be happy to discuss this further if you'd like more specific advice based on your implementation details.",

This separates parsing from validation.\n\n**Intent classification + scope checking**: Train the gatekeeper to first classify the primary intent, then check if that intent type is allowed, rather than trying to validate the entire natural language request holistically.\n\n**Explicit disambiguation**: When the gatekeeper detects ambiguous or multi-part requests, have it ask clarifying questions rather than making assumptions about what to validate.\n\n**Whitelist approach**: Instead of trying to catch all invalid requests, define clear categories of valid actions and have the gatekeeper confirm the request fits one of those patterns.\n\nThe key insight I've seen work is treating this less like content moderation (reject bad things) and more like structured parsing (extract and validate specific actionable components).\n\nThis is definitely a problem I've wrestled with before - the \"smart but safe\" balance is tricky because natural language is inherently ambiguous.

          "response": "Absolutely, this is a classic challenge when building LLM-based filters or gatekeepers—striking the right balance between being permissive enough to handle real user language, and strict enough to prevent unwanted or out-of-scope requests from leaking through.\n\nHere are a few high-level strategies and considerations based on real-world experience:\n\n**1. Explicit Task Framing with Examples:**  \nLLMs respond well to examples and clear task definitions. Consider framing your prompt with:\n- A clear instruction about what counts as “valid” (e.g., only single, supported actions).\n- Positive and negative examples (e.g., “Accept: ‘delete this channel’, ‘please remove channel’, ‘kinda delete this channel’. Reject: ‘create a channel and tell me a joke’”).\n\n**2. Use Step-by-Step Reasoning:**  \nPrompt the model to first paraphrase or “extract the intent” in plain language, and then judge if it’s valid. This reduces hallucination by separating understanding from validation.\n\n**3. Ask for a Structured Output:**  \nRequest a JSON or similar structure:  \n{ \"valid\": true/false, \"reason\": \"...\", \"primary_action\": \"delete\", \"target\": \"channel\" }\n\n**4. Layered Filtering:**  \nCombine a lightweight rules-based pre-filter (to catch blatantly out-of-scope requests) with your LLM-based gatekeeper, so the LLM only needs to handle ambiguous/edge cases.\n\n**5. Regularly Retrain and Iterate:**  \nCollect logs of false positives/negatives, and regularly update your prompt/examples as you learn more about user behavior.\n\n**6. Be Upfront About Limitations:**  \nIf you find that the LLM can't reliably distinguish between single and multi-action requests (like “create a channel and tell me a joke”), consider clarifying this in the user interface or documentation, or building UI affordances that discourage compound actions.\n\n**7. Consider User Feedback Loops:**  \nIf a user’s request is rejected, tell them why and let them rephrase, which helps both your model and the user adapt.\n\nIf you want to chat specifics, feel free to DM! Would also suggest checking out papers and blog posts about LLM “intent recognition” and “task extraction”—lots of practical tips floating around now that more teams are facing exactly this.\n\nGood luck!",

A few ideas that might help:\n\n1. Narrow the Gatekeeper’s Role and Language:\n   • In your prompt, repeatedly emphasize that the model should only interpret, validate, or reject requests—never embellish or attempt to fulfill them directly.  \n   • When requests have a valid but colloquial phrasing, instruct the model to normalize that phrasing into standard user intentions (e.g., “kinda delete this channel” → “delete channel”).\n\n2. Use Step-by-Step Analysis:\n   • A chain-of-thought style or short bullet-point reasoning step can help the LLM parse out the user’s actual intent.  \n   • For instance, prompt it: “First, restate the user’s request. Then decide if this request matches a valid system command. Finally, provide pass/fail.” This structure encourages the model to focus on analyzing the request rather than “answering” it.\n\n3. Explicitly List Allowed/Disallowed Actions:\n   • Provide a short, explicit set of “allowed” commands (create channel, delete channel, etc.) vs. “out-of-scope” actions (tell me a joke, order pizza, etc.).  \n   • If the user’s request includes items from both lists—like “create a channel and tell me a joke”—the gatekeeper must flag any disallowed portion rather than try to fulfill it.\n\n4. Lean on Strict Parsing:\n   • Try to parse the user request into a structured form (e.g., command: “delete channel”).  \n   • Natural-language flexibility can still be accounted for, but the end result should feed a consistent structure that the gatekeeper checks.\n\n5. Have Clear Failure Modes:\n   • Let the gatekeeper respond with a “reject” or “revise-and-repeat,” if it’s unsure. This is often better than letting it guess or hallucinate.  \n   • You can explicitly allow the gatekeeper to say something like: “Unclear intent—please confirm if you want me to [perform allowed action].”\n\nIf you still find it too rigid or too lenient, it may help to do a small “prompt ensemble”: \n• For instance, run two gatekeeper prompts in parallel—one strict and one flexible—and reconcile the outputs (with some logic that says if the strict gatekeeper rejects but the flexible gatekeeper validates, the system tries to clarify the user’s intent).\n\nHope that gives you some fresh angles. Feel free to DM if you’d like to talk further about fine-tuning these strategies—this is definitely a balancing act!",

          "response": "It sounds like you’re wrestling with the classic trade-off between overly rigid versus overly lax filtering. Here are a few strategic ideas to consider as you refine your gatekeeper approach:\n\n1. Use a two-step “interpret then validate” process. One idea is to have the LLM first distill the user’s intent from their colloquial phrasing into a normalized, canonical form (e.g., “delete channel”) and then validate that derived intent. That way, you can handle extra-flavor language like “kinda” without penalizing the request. The first step focuses on translation and interpretation, while the second step applies strict rules about allowed actions.\n\n2. Define clear boundaries with examples. Embedding a few well-chosen examples in your prompt can help steer the model. You might illustrate valid requests phrased in informal language alongside clearly invalid ones. This “in-context learning” can cue the model to ignore extraneous details (like the joke part) and focus on the core action. It’s a balancing act: the examples should be detailed enough to cover edge cases without overwhelming the system with rigid rules.\n\n3. Modularize the tasks. If a request contains multiple parts (e.g., “create a channel and tell me a joke”), you might consider detecting and parsing out multiple intents before validation. A lightweight parser could split the input into segments and only allow one actionable command per request, or flag the ambiguous parts for clarification. This reduces hallucination because each module (parsing versus validating) does its job within a well-defined scope.\n\n4. Establish a “fallback” state. For requests that are ambiguous or include multiple actions, consider having the gatekeeper ask for clarification rather than trying to interpret everything at once. For instance, if the request seems to mix legitimate commands with additional tasks, the gatekeeper could output a message like, “I see two potential actions here. Did you mean to delete the channel, or is there something else you’d like to do?” This clarifies intent without needing the system to hallucinate a resolution.\n\n5. Leverage prompt meta-instructions. In the gatekeeper’s instructions you might explicitly state that it should ignore certain types of extraneous content. For example, add a note like “If a request includes additional commentary that is not part of the core action (e.g., jokes or casual qualifiers), focus only on the actionable instruction.” This clearly delineates which parts of the sentence are “decorative” rather than part of the command, helping the model to filter effectively.\n\n6. Consider gradual temperature adjustments. Sometimes a lower temperature in the LLM can reduce hallucinations, while a slightly higher one can help with parsing colloquial language. Experiment with subtly adjusting these settings in each stage of your pipeline to see if you can get the best of both worlds.\n\nUltimately, you’re aiming to design a gating system that is both “forgiving” of informal language yet precise in isolating valid actions. Iterative testing with a range of realistic inputs can help you tune those parameters and find a reliable sweet spot.\n\nHope these suggestions help you break out of that loop—and I’d love to hear how your experiments turn out!",

Structured Output Format**\nForce the gatekeeper to output in a structured format that separates:\n- Primary intent\n- Confidence level\n- Any secondary/invalid requests detected\n\n**4. \"Principle-Based\" Instead of \"Rule-Based\" Prompting**\nRather than listing what's not allowed, focus on principles:\n- \"Extract only the channel management intent\"\n- \"Ignore any requests unrelated to channel operations\"\n- \"If multiple intents exist, only process the first valid one\"\n\n**5. Confidence Thresholds**\nHave the gatekeeper output a confidence score. You can then:\n- High confidence (>90%): Auto-approve\n- Medium (60-90%): Apply stricter validation\n- Low (<60%): Reject or ask for clarification\n\nWould love to hear more about your specific use case - the type of actions you're validating and what your current prompt structure looks like.

Also, which LLM(s) are you using for the gatekeeper? (OpenAI, Anthropic, open-source, etc.)\n\nIn general, here are some strategies others have used:\n\n1. Chain-of-thought prompting: Instead of a single pass, ask the LLM to explain its reasoning step by step before making a decision (\"What is the user asking for? Is it in scope?\"). This can surface whether the LLM is missing subtle intent.\n\n2. Example-driven prompts: Give the LLM a list of in-scope and out-of-scope examples, and instruct it to mimic the boundaries (\"Approve requests like these, reject requests like those\").\n\n3. Conservative fallback: If unsure, have the model ask for clarification (\"I don't understand, can you rephrase?\") rather than assume out-of-scope requests are in-scope.\n\n4. Separate intent detection and validation: Use one call to extract intent, and a second to judge if that intent is valid.\n\n5. Post-processing: Have a lightweight, hard-coded filter (e.g., regex, keywords) before/after the LLM to catch obvious mistakes.\n\n6. Human-in-the-loop for edge cases: Log ambiguous requests and periodically review them to refine your prompt.\n\nIf you can provide your current prompt and a few tricky examples, I can help brainstorm ways to tweak the phrasing or structure. Sometimes even a single sentence change can improve boundary handling a lot.\n\nLet me know if you want to DM or keep chatting here!",

          "success": false,
          "response": "Here are a few high-level ideas you might consider when designing a “gatekeeper” prompt or system:\n\n1) Use a two-phase checking strategy.  \n   • First, have a lightweight model (or a carefully crafted rule-based approach) perform a quick classification of the request. It doesn’t need to interpret the request in depth—it just needs to figure out if it’s potentially valid or not obviously disallowed.  \n   • Second, if it passes that quick check, hand the request to a more nuanced gating prompt (still cheaper than your most expensive model) that does additional interpretation (e.g., clarifies whether “kinda delete” is just casual phrasing vs. an out-of-scope action). If it’s valid, finally pass it to the big, expensive model.  \n\n2) Add clarifying steps to your gatekeeper prompt.  \n   • One reason a “strict” prompt might fail on colloquial inputs is that it tries to interpret them literally rather than exploring if the user is simply using informal language.  \n   • Prompt the model to “assume good faith user intent unless the request is clearly disallowed” and, if uncertain, to ask clarifying questions (or to mark the request as “needs clarification” instead of outright rejecting).  \n\n3) Provide carefully chosen examples in the gatekeeper’s few-shot prompt.  \n   • Show examples of slightly ambiguous colloquial requests (“kinda delete this channel,” “yeah can you just create a channel real quick?”) paired with the correct gatekeeper response (e.g., “Interpret as ‘delete this channel’… proceed.”).  \n   • Also provide examples where multiple tasks are combined, with instructions on how to handle “in-scope vs. out-of-scope” actions (“create a channel” is in-scope, “tell a joke” might be harmless but out of scope for a system that only deals with channel management—perhaps the gatekeeper should separate or ignore the second request).  \n   • These examples guide the model to handle borderline cases without over- or under-rejecting.  \n\n4) Emphasize handling partial or combined requests.  \n   • Users commonly chain requests (“create a channel and x, y, z”). Make sure your gatekeeper is taught to (a) identify which parts are relevant to the system’s capabilities, (b) either ignore or gracefully decline out-of-scope parts, and (c) confirm or pass on only the relevant sub-request.  \n\n5) Keep an eye on “metaprompt” complexity.  \n   • Even well-intentioned prompts can get so complex that they lead to inconsistent outcomes. Sometimes going simpler is more reliable. For example, you might create smaller modules that do very narrow checks—like “reject if the user is explicitly requesting disallowed content or violent threats,” “ask for clarification if the user’s request is ambiguous,” “pass through if the request is clearly in-scope”—rather than one gigantic universal prompt that tries to do everything.  \n\n6) Log near-miss cases for iterative tuning.  \n   • As you test, keep track of inputs that were mistakenly rejected and those that were mistakenly approved. Regularly add them as examples in the gatekeeper’s training or prompting context. This feedback loop will reduce both false positives and false negatives over time.  \n\n7) Consider user re-confirmation.  \n   • If your gatekeeper is unsure—say, it’s 70% sure that “kinda delete the channel” means “delete the channel”—it can respond with a clarifying question or short re-confirmation like, “Did you want to delete the channel?” This extra step often helps resolve borderline requests safely and politely.  \n\nBy breaking your system into smaller steps—and by baking in clarifications and curated examples—you can strike a workable balance between “overly strict” and “overly flexible.” Keep iterating on your examples and watch real-world usage patterns to refine the prompt further.

          "response": "Of course! Here are some strategic thoughts on your gatekeeper LLM design, drawn from experience with similar systems:\n\n1. Explicit Task Framing  \nMake the gatekeeper’s role extremely clear in the prompt: “Only validate requests for [the allowed action set]; ignore or reject anything else.” It helps to literally list allowed actions and state that the model should not attempt to ‘interpret’ or ‘fix’ out-of-scope or multi-intent requests.\n\n2. Intent Extraction, Not Execution  \nFrame the gatekeeper’s job as extracting and classifying the user’s intent, not responding or ‘helping’ directly. For example: “Does this message contain a clear request to delete a channel? Yes/No.” This reduces the model’s tendency to hallucinate or elaborate.\n\n3. Reject Ambiguity and Multi-intent  \nExplicitly prompt the model to reject requests with multiple or ambiguous actions (“If the request asks for more than one action, reject it. If the request is unclear, reject it.”). This helps avoid the “create a channel and tell me a joke” issue.\n\n4. Use Examples—But Balance Strictness  \nProvide both positive and negative examples, including edge cases. For instance:\n- “delete this channel” → Accept\n- “can you maybe delete this?” → Accept\n- “delete and rename the channel” → Reject\n- “what’s the weather?” → Reject\n\n5. Consider Output Format  \nAsk for a simple, structured output (e.g., Accept/Reject plus a reason or extracted intent), which can make downstream handling clearer and reduce hallucination.\n\n6. Iterate with Real Data  \nTest your prompts on real or simulated user data. See where it fails, and tweak. Sometimes, a little rewording in the prompt or additional negative examples will make a big difference.\n\n7. Chain of Filters  \nIf your LLM has trouble handling both ambiguity and colloquial language, consider a two-stage filter: one LLM to clarify intent (normalize colloquial input to a canonical form), then another to strictly validate.\n\n8. Don’t Aim for Perfection  \nFinally, accept that some edge cases will always slip through. Your fallback can be to handle uncertain cases with a human review or a fallback “Sorry, I didn’t understand. Please rephrase.”\n\nHappy to discuss further—these kinds of guardrail problems are both tricky and fascinating!",

Overly long or vague instructions can make the model drift.  \n• Where possible, rely on a structured format for the output (e.g., always returning “interpretation,” “classification,” and “decision” fields) instead of free text.  \n• Test with real user inputs—especially informal, partial, or ambiguous ones—to tune your final prompt.  \n\nHope that helps you find the sweet spot between being robust and flexible!

          "response": "Here are a few ideas worth considering when trying to nail that balance between strict validation and accommodating natural, sometimes messy, language:\n\n1. Define explicit command boundaries. One approach is to create a command “schema” or list of allowed verbs/intents (like delete, create, update, etc.). Then design the prompt so that the LLM first extracts the core intent and parameters. This extraction stage can be more lenient in understanding colloquial language (such as \"kinda delete this channel\") while then matching it precisely to an authorized command.\n\n2. Use a two-stage process. Rather than having one prompt do all the work, break it into stages. The first stage can be a quick, flexible natural language parser that interprets the user’s intent, while the second stage acts as a validator that checks whether that interpreted intent aligns with permitted operations. This decoupling allows you to “soft interpret” the request then “hard validate” the result.\n\n3. Implement fallback or clarification questions. If the LLM is uncertain or if the request is ambiguous (like when additional out-of-scope parts appear), consider programming a fallback where the system asks the user for clarification. This can avoid the risk of hallucinating or misinterpreting extra parts of a query (like the “tell me a joke” in the earlier example).\n\n4. Use explicit examples and counterexamples. In the prompt, you can embed a few examples of acceptable and unacceptable phrasing. By illustrating typical colloquial rewordings of valid commands, alongside cases that mix in unrelated actions, you give the model concrete guidance about what to accept or ignore.\n\n5. Incorporate a “sanity check” for out-of-scope detail. One trick is instructing the LLM to isolate the core command from additional commentary. For instance, you might say: “Extract only the operational request relevant to channel management and ignore any extra text unrelated to that action.” That way, even if the input is noisy, the LLM can filter out the extra “joke” request.\n\n6. Experiment with temperature and lengths. Sometimes a slightly lower temperature can reduce hallucinations. If hallucinating out-of-scope actions remains an issue, try prompting strategies that encourage a more deterministic, step-by-step extraction of intent.\n\n7. Iterative prompt refinement. It can help to adopt a testing and feedback loop. Start with a baseline prompt for your gatekeeper and iterate based on failure modes you observe. Sometimes even minor wording tweaks (or adding “if uncertain, output: 'ambiguous command'”) can dramatically improve performance.\n\nUltimately, the ideal solution might be a blend of these strategies: robust extraction of intent using multiple steps, clear examples within the prompt, and safeguards to reject or request clarification when multiple commands or ambiguous details are detected.\n\nI hope these strategies help break the loop you’re stuck in! Let me know if you’d like to dive deeper into any of these approaches.",

For example:\n- First pass: \"What action(s) is the user trying to perform? List only the primary actions.\"\n- Second pass: \"Are all extracted actions within scope?\"\n\nThis helps with colloquial language (\"kinda delete\") while preventing scope creep.\n\n**2.

Layered Validation**\nRather than one catch-all prompt:\n- Layer 1: Intent extraction and normalization\n- Layer 2: Scope validation (is this action allowed?)\n- Layer 3: Parameter validation (are required params present?)\n\n**4. \"Principle-Based\" Instructions**\nInstead of rigid rules, give the gatekeeper principles like:\n- \"Focus only on the primary action related to [your domain]\"\n- \"Ignore tangential requests outside the system's capabilities\"\n- \"When in doubt about intent, extract the most likely system-relevant action\"\n\nWould love to hear more about your specific use case - the domain and types of actions you're validating might influence which approach works best!",

Explicitly Separate \"Core Action\" from \"Extras\":**  \nIn your prompt, nudge the LLM to only consider the primary action relevant to your system. For instance, instruct it to \"identify only the main actionable intent related to system functions (e.g., create/delete channel), and ignore unrelated requests.\" This can help avoid hallucinating support for out-of-scope instructions like \"tell me a joke.\"\n\n**2. Use Stepwise Reasoning:**  \nAsk the LLM to first paraphrase or summarize the user's request, then decide if it's valid. Breaking it into steps often increases accuracy:  \n- Step 1: What is the user's intended action?  \n- Step 2: Is this action supported by the system? (Y/N)\n\n**3. Provide Both Positive and Negative Examples:**  \nIn your prompt, add a handful of explicit allowed/blocked examples, especially edge cases like \"kinda delete this channel,\" \"delete plz,\" or mixed requests. LLMs often generalize better with concrete contrastive examples.\n\n**4. Rejection with Explanation:**  \nHave the LLM explain *why* it rejected an input. If the explanation doesn't match your expectations, you know where the prompt's boundaries are too tight or loose.\n\n**5. Limit Output Format:**  \nConstraining the output to e.g., `{\"valid\": true/false, \"reason\": ...}` can help prevent drift into hallucinations, especially if the LLM is only supposed to classify, not execute or generate.\n\n**6. Consider Multistage Filtering:**  \nSometimes, using a small rules-based pre-filter (for egregiously invalid requests), then the LLM, then perhaps another lightweight check, gives you more control.\n\n**7. Prompt Iteration is Normal:**  \nIt's common to need many rounds of prompt tweaking and adversarial testing. Logs of real user requests are gold for this.\n\n**8. When in Doubt, Favor Safety:**  \nIf you're unsure, err on the side of stricter filtering—users can always rephrase, but unsafe actions are harder to walk back.\n\nHappy to chat more if you have specific edge cases or want to trade more examples!\n\n(And yes, I've wrestled with this in production LLM systems—it's a subtle art!)",

          "response": "Here are a few directions and considerations you might explore—hopefully one or two spark some new ideas:\n\n1) Think of Your Gatekeeper Prompt as a “Routing” Task  \n   • In effect, the gatekeeper’s job is to determine:  \n     – Is this request valid and within scope?  \n     – If so, what are the relevant “keywords” or instructions we should pass on to the more powerful model?  \n     – If not, how should we reject/redirect it?  \n   • This framing forces you to define (a) what “in scope” really means and (b) how you want instructions to be extracted. The gatekeeper shouldn’t do partial fulfillment itself; it should only pass the request forward or refuse it.\n\n2) Separate “Core Intent” Extraction from “Safety Checks”  \n   • You might try chaining multiple, tightly scoped prompts instead of having a single monolithic prompt. For example:  \n     – First prompt: “Identify user’s main request in minimal form (e.g., create, delete, configure).”  \n     – Second prompt: “Check if user’s main request is allowed according to policy. If not, reject. If yes, proceed.”  \n   • This structure can help ensure your first step is purely about clarifying intent (without judgment), while the second step focuses on applying the rules. This reduces the risk of the model mixing up the tasks (accidentally “hallucinating” a new request or incorrectly formatting the user’s request).\n\n3) Consider Edge Cases for Colloquial Language  \n   • One approach is to maintain a small “lexicon” or set of transformations for colloquialisms you’ve seen in user testing. For instance:  \n     – “kinda delete” → “delete”  \n     – “wanna remove” → “remove”  \n     – “lemme see” → “show me”  \n   • By including examples in system or few-shot prompts (“If user says ‘kinda delete this channel,’ interpret that as ‘delete this channel’”), your gatekeeper LLM learns to normalize language before verifying or rejecting.\n\n4) Leverage Clear Decision Points in the Prompt  \n   • Sometimes prompting is more reliable when it’s extremely explicit in how the model should answer (e.g., “Answer ONLY with one of [‘VALID’, ‘INVALID’, ‘CANNOT PARSE’], given the request and these policies…”).  \n   • Then, given the label, you can have separate logic that decides the next step. This keeps the gatekeeper’s role small and strictly defined (“label the request” rather than “label + parse + transform + rewrite + disclaim,” etc.).\n\n5) Provide Minimal Context to the Gatekeeper  \n   • If you feed too much background to the gatekeeper, it might overextend itself, hallucinate details, or try to be “helpful” beyond just gating. Keep the gatekeeper’s context short and sweet (e.g., policy docs + instructions) to reduce unnecessary model “creativity.”\n\n6) If a Request Contains Multiple Actions, Handle Them Individually  \n   • You mentioned the example “create a channel and tell me a joke.” Are these both valid requests for your system? Maybe “create a channel” is valid, “tell me a joke” is not.  \n   • Consider instructing the gatekeeper to separate unknown/spurious requests into distinct parts and decide which ones are allowed or disallowed. If the user’s request is partly out of scope, you might pass through only the valid portion.  \n   • That said, you have to decide whether you want partial acceptance or a single yes/no outcome. Both approaches have trade-offs.\n\n7) Incorporate Real-World User Testing  \n   • No matter how clever your prompt design, real users will come up with strange phrasings. Gather those phrasings, see which ones fail, and incorporate them into your example prompts or few-shot examples.  \n   • An iterative approach—where you refine the gatekeeper prompt in response to real data—often yields better results than a theoretically “perfect” prompt generated in isolation.\n\n8) Consider a Hybrid Learning Approach  \n   • If purely prompt-based solutions keep failing on certain colloquialisms or out-of-scope requests, you might consider a small classifier (trained on examples) that runs before the LLM or in parallel. This classifier might detect obviously out-of-scope or disallowed requests.  \n   • The LLM gatekeeper would handle more nuanced cases—e.g., subtle policy checks or ambiguous phrasing. This can be an efficient approach if your data set of “common invalid requests” is well-defined and relatively static.\n\n9) Accept that “Perfect” is Hard—Aim for a Measured Risk Level  \n   • At the end of the day, complex user language + an LLM means you’ll never get 100% perfect gating. Decide how conservative or liberal your system can afford to be. If the cost of a false “allow” is high (e.g., a security risk), weigh that against the user frustration from false “reject.”  \n   • You might even do a second pass for borderline results—piping them to the more expensive model in a “Check if user’s request is truly valid” mode, or sending them to a human review queue if the stakes are high.\n\nUltimately, there’s no single best prompt. It’s usually a combination of:  \n• well-defined scope and policy,  \n• wrangling the model via short, explicit instructions, and  \n• iterative refinements based on real usage.\n\nHope some of these ideas help you break out of the loop. If you have specific follow-up questions about any of these aspects, let me know and I can share more detail on how I’ve seen them implemented before.",

          "response": "When trying to balance smart and safe gatekeeping, a few strategies and considerations might help refine your design:\n\n1. Be explicit about your allowed “action space.” Rather than trying to interpret every nuance of user language, you can clearly define the set of actions that the downstream system supports. Then have the gating prompt focus on verifying which action is intended. For example, when the user says “kinda delete this channel,” your prompt can include explicit clauses such as “only allow requests that clearly indicate one of the following actions: delete, create, update” to help the model map colloquial language into one of those choices.\n\n2. Use few-shot examples to train context. Providing short examples of both acceptable colloquial inputs that map to valid actions and borderline cases that should be rejected (or deferred to clarification) can help the model generalize better. This “in-context learning” can make the gatekeeping model more forgiving to natural language variance but also alert to additional elements like extra actions (the “joke” part) that are out-of-scope.\n\n3. Consider a multi-step or clarifying approach. Rather than expecting the gatekeeper to both identify and validate a request in one shot, you could structure the process into discrete steps. For example, the first pass might just classify the intended action, and if additional actions are mentioned (like “tell me a joke”), the system could flag it for clarification or forward only the valid part. This layered approach helps keep the validation focused while reducing the chance of the model hallucinating or over-interpreting additional content.\n\n4. Leverage rephrasing: Ask the model to rephrase the request along with a confidence rating. For example, having a prompt that says, “Briefly explain the intended action in one sentence, and then rate your confidence (high/medium/low)” can reveal whether the model is processing the input correctly. If the explanation mixes different actions or shows uncertainty, you might decide to either ask follow-up questions or simply reject the input.\n\n5. Include boundaries explicitly. In your prompt, state something like, “Ignore any part of the input that does not constitute a valid action as defined below.” This sets up a rule that the LLM should disregard parts that fall outside of the defined action set. You can combine that rule with a direction like, “If in doubt, ask for clarification rather than attempt to process every request element.”\n\n6. Test iteratively with edge cases. Create a battery of test requests that cover a range of colloquial variations and mixed requests. Iterative testing helps you see where the gate might be too strict or too flexible. You can adjust the prompt incrementally: if too many valid requests are being rejected, widen the language interpretation slightly; if too many unexpected additions slip through, add examples and instructions to focus on the allowed actions exclusively.\n\n7. Explore hybrid solutions. Sometimes using multiple signals (e.g., using a lightweight classifier or rule-based prefiltering before prompting the LLM) can reinforce the gatekeeper’s decision. Even a simple pattern match for known keywords might serve as an early filter that reduces the burden on the LLM and helps it focus on disambiguating nuances in valid requests.\n\nEach strategy comes with trade-offs: too much specificity can harm natural language flexibility, while more forgiving prompts might let undesired requests pass or lead to over-interpretation of out-of-scope content. Balancing these trade-offs typically involves tuning the prompt examples, instructions, and fallback behaviors based on your test data.\n\nThese ideas might help you think about redesigning your prompt strategy. It’s all about isolating the action you care about and ensuring clarity in instructions. Happy prototyping—and feel free to bounce more ideas if you need to refine the approach further!",

          "response": "I've tackled similar challenges before, especially around using a smaller \"gatekeeper\" model to filter requests before involving a larger, more costly model. The balance you're describing is a common challenge: too strict prompts lead to rejection of valid colloquial inputs, while too flexible prompts allow unintended or out-of-scope actions.\n\nHere are some strategic approaches that worked for me and might help you break out of the loop:\n\n### 1. **Separate Intent Classification from Validation**\n- Instead of a single prompt doing both intent parsing and validation simultaneously, split tasks clearly into two steps:\n  - **Step 1 (Intent Classification)**: A prompt/model specifically designed to understand user intent in colloquial language, using a more flexible and understanding tone. For example:\n    - `\"Classify the intent of the following user request. Be tolerant of informal language or slang. Do not apply validation yet, just extract intent clearly.\"`\n  - **Step 2 (Scope and Safety Validation)**: A second prompt or validation layer explicitly designed to check if the classified intent is within the allowed scope and safe to execute. This prompt can be stricter, as it deals with structured intent rather than raw user input.\n  \nSeparating the concerns helps balance flexibility and strictness in the right places.\n\n### 2. **Use Structured Formats in Intermediate Steps**\n- A structured intermediate representation (such as JSON or a simple intent-action schema) can help:\n  - Prompt the gatekeeper model to first parse and normalize the user's input into a structured intent representation.\n  - Then, validate this structured representation against your allowed scope and actions.\n- This approach reduces hallucination because the model explicitly knows the output format and context, and it becomes easier to filter out-of-scope requests.\n\nExample structure:\n```json\n{\n  \"action\": \"delete_channel\",\n  \"certainty\": \"medium\",\n  \"notes\": \"User colloquially requested to delete\"\n}\n```\n\n### 3. **Explicitly Enumerate Allowed/Disallowed Actions**\n- Clearly listing allowed and disallowed actions in your prompts can greatly reduce ambiguity and hallucinations.\n- For instance:\n  ```\n  Allowed actions: [\"create_channel\", \"delete_channel\", \"rename_channel\"]\n  Disallowed actions: [\"tell_joke\", \"generate_poem\", \"answer_general_questions\"]\n  ```\n- By explicitly enumerating boundaries, the model is less likely to hallucinate or go beyond scope.\n\n### 4. **Confidence Scoring & Thresholding**\n- Have the gatekeeper model return a \"confidence score\" or \"certainty level\" for its own interpretation. \n- You can easily reject or approve based on thresholds, or even defer ambiguous cases to human review or another validation step.\n\n### 5. **Few-shot Examples (Balanced and Diverse)**\n- Provide a diverse set of few-shot examples that intentionally cover edge cases, casual language, and nuanced rejection scenarios.\n- Examples should clearly show the model how to handle borderline phrases like `\"kinda delete this channel\"` or multi-intent requests `\"create a channel and tell me a joke\"` explicitly demonstrating the correct parsing or rejection behavior.\n\n### 6. **Chain-of-Thought or Reasoning Steps**\n- Consider explicitly prompting the model to reason through the request step-by-step:\n  - \"First, identify each requested action separately. Then, validate each action against allowed actions.\"\n- This structured reasoning encourages clearer separation of intents.\n\n### 7. **Fallback & Human-in-the-Loop**\n- For ambiguous or borderline-cases, consider a fallback process:\n  - If confidence is low, escalate to human review or a specialized prompt for clarification.\n\n### Recommended Combined Approach:\n- **Two-stage classification (intent parsing → validation)**  \n- **Explicit structured intermediate representation**  \n- **Clear enumeration of allowed/disallowed actions**  \n- **Confidence scoring with thresholding**\n\nThis approach has allowed me (and others I've worked with) to consistently balance flexibility in understanding user intent and strictness in ensuring scope and safety.

Explicit intent extraction vs. direct filtering:**  \nInstead of phrasing the prompt as \"is this request valid?,\" try asking the LLM to extract the core action or intent (\"What is the main action the user wants to perform?\"). Then, in your code or post-processing, check if that intent matches your allowed actions. This makes colloquial phrasing more robustly handled, since the model's job is to paraphrase rather than judge.\n\n**2. Enumerate allowed actions and require mapping:**  \nGive the gatekeeper a list of permissible actions and ask it to map the input to one (or none) of these. For example:  \n*\"Given the following allowed actions: [A, B, C], which does this request map to? If none, respond 'none'.\"*  \nThis reduces hallucination, as the model must ground its answer in your set.\n\n**3. Multi-step prompting:**  \nIf one prompt is too brittle, consider a two-stage approach:  \n- First, extract the core action(s) the user wants.  \n- Second, check if each extracted action is allowed.  \nThis modularizes the judgment and makes debugging easier.\n\n**4. Be explicit about out-of-scope or multi-intent:**  \nIn your prompt, specify what to do if the request contains multiple actions or out-of-scope requests. For instance,  \n*\"If the request contains more than one action or any action not in the list, respond 'invalid'.\"*\n\n**5. Use real user data for prompt tuning:**  \nGather a set of real, messy user inputs and iterate your prompt on these. You'll quickly see patterns where the model is too strict or too loose and can adjust accordingly.\n\n**6. Consider fallback or escalation:**  \nIf the gatekeeper is unsure (e.g., low confidence, ambiguous phrasing), you can route those requests for human review or a more expensive validation step.\n\n**7.

          "response": "Here are a few ideas based on experiences I’ve had setting up similar “gatekeeper → advanced model” pipelines:\n\n1) Think of the gatekeeper as a strict classifier first, and a paraphraser second.  \n   • In your prompt, give the gatekeeper a structured, discrete set of allowed actions or categories. Instead of telling it, “Understand the user’s request in plain language,” instruct it more like: “Determine which of these 5 categories the user’s request belongs to.”  \n   • Once it tags or classifies, it can pass the user’s text verbatim (or a minimally normalized version) as needed. Avoid letting the gatekeeper rewrite or interpret user intent too freely—because that is precisely where hallucination creeps in.\n\n2) Break things into smaller gates.  \n   • Rather than a single gatekeeper that tries to handle everything—understanding, verifying, formatting the user’s request—consider small, sequential checks. One step checks for forbidden content or nonsense. Another step tries to interpret user context and reformat if needed. Each is smaller in scope, which often improves reliability.  \n   • This modular approach also helps you localize issues so you know whether the problem is with your validation layer vs. language understanding vs. content filtering.\n\n3) Give the gatekeeper strict instructions about what it should not attempt.  \n   • For example, you can explicitly say, “If the user requests multiple or combined actions beyond this system’s known commands, return with a note that the request is out of scope.” Or, “If any part of the request involves telling jokes, pass that text along directly but do not attempt to interpret or process the joke itself.”  \n   • By enumerating what it should not handle, you reduce the chance that it tries to interpret or partially execute out-of-scope requests. \n\n4) Use robust negative examples in your prompt and in your few-shot examples.  \n   • Show several examples of so-called “false positives” (where the gatekeeper incorrectly rejects a valid request) and demonstrate the correct classification or outcome. This helps the model learn the nuance of informal requests like “kinda delete this channel.”  \n   • Also show examples where multiple tasks are requested (“create a channel and tell me a joke”) but the system only addresses the tasks within scope (e.g., “create channel”) and passes along the rest or flags them. \n\n5) Tune your gating threshold based on real user data—but do so iteratively.  \n   • Start with a conservative approach. Collect user logs or test queries that fail in ways you don’t want (false rejections vs. missed dangerous requests). Then adjust your prompt to specifically address them.  \n   • You’ll likely be in an “evaluate → refine” loop for a while. But over time, your gating prompt will become more robust.\n\n6) If you can, combine rule-based filters with the LLM-based gate.  \n   • Even a few simple regex patterns or lexical checks for obviously disallowed requests can take the load off your LLM. Then the LLM only handles edge/corner cases where inexpensive heuristics are insufficient.  \n   • This combined approach often boosts reliability and reduces overall cost.\n\nOverall, keep the gatekeeper’s job as narrow as possible: it’s mostly deciding if the request is “valid and in scope” or not, possibly with a light classification or minimal rewrite. Any heavier interpretation or expansion is better handled downstream by a more capable model (which is presumably more expensive).\n\nGood luck, and happy to give more ideas if you have follow-up questions!",

          "response": "Here are some strategies and perspectives you might consider as you try to strike that balance:\n\n1. One approach is to break the gatekeeper’s work into multiple steps. For example, you might first have a phase that “normalizes” or interprets the user’s input into a set of candidate intents. That first step can be somewhat flexible, catching colloquial language (like “kinda delete this channel”) and mapping it to a known intent (e.g., delete). Then, in a second phase, you could validate whether the interpreted action falls into the allowed “vocabulary” of actions.\n\n2. Instead of putting all your logic into one long prompt, consider structuring the process as a chain of thought internally (even if you don’t output all details). You might instruct the model with a prompt like “Break down the following request into its component intents, label each one, and then decide if any intent falls outside the approved action list.” The chain-of-thought here doesn’t need to be presented to the user, but it helps the model self-check and separate core actions from extraneous requests like “tell me a joke.”\n\n3. Using examples within your prompt can help calibrate the behavior. Present a few cases of “good” requests (even if in colloquial language) and ones that mix might-be-safe actions with out-of-scope extras. This way, you prime the model to be cautious about additional, potentially spurious, intent fragments.\n\n4. Consider asking the model to “flag” ambiguous parts of the input for further clarification. For instance, if the user writes something that includes multiple instructions (like creating a channel and, in the same sentence, asking for a joke), have the gatekeeper respond by either only validating the safe part or by generating a clarifying question. This turns the inherent ambiguity into an opportunity for a safe fallback.\n\n5. Define a clear allowed actions list within the prompt. This way, the model’s “worldview” is constrained. You can instruct it to first parse the request and then compare each detected action against a whitelist. If it finds extra actions (like “joking” over and above a channel creation), it could either ignore the extra part explicitly or decide that the input is too mixed to be safely processed.\n\n6. Iterative tuning and testing are key. Start with a prompt design and iterate with many real-world examples. Keep track of cases where valid inputs are rejected and cases where out-of-scope actions slip through. Adjust the level of strictness accordingly. Sometimes you may even need to dynamically adjust the prompt’s behavior (or even select between a “strict” and “lenient” mode) based on the context or past user interactions.\n\n7. Finally, transparency in error handling can be instructive. Let the model know, “If you’re not 100% sure that the request only contains the allowed action, then respond with an uncertainty flag or ask for clarification.” This design choice acknowledges the inherent limitations of a single-turn prompt and lets you mitigate hallucinations or over-reaching responses.\n\nIn summary, think of your gatekeeper as a layered system. First, interpret the user’s intent with some flexibility. Then, validate strictly against allowed actions, and finally, handle ambiguities gracefully by either ignoring extra instructions or asking for clarifications. This “filter first, then verify” approach may help you better balance between flexibility (to handle colloquial inputs) and safety (to prevent unintended actions).\n\nHope that gives you a few ideas to try out!

          "response": "You're facing a very common but tricky challenge when using an LLM as a natural language \"gatekeeper.\" Here are a few strategic points and prompting approaches that might help you strike the right balance:\n\n### 1. **Clearly Define Allowed Scope (Domain Awareness)**  \n- Clearly state your allowed actions and explicitly list common examples of **in-scope** and clearly **out-of-scope** requests.  \n- Explicitly describe what the LLM should do when it encounters ambiguous or partially valid requests (e.g., `\"create a channel and tell me a joke\"`).  \n- Consider splitting compound requests and giving the LLM explicit instructions to reject or flag any request that includes even partial out-of-scope tasks.\n\n### 2. **Prompt Engineering via Few-shot Examples**  \n- Provide explicit positive and negative examples in your prompt:  \n  - **Valid but casual:** `\"kinda delete this channel\" → VALID, intent: delete channel\"`  \n  - **Invalid/Partially invalid:** `\"create a channel and tell me a joke\" → INVALID: multiple intents or partially out-of-scope\"`  \n- Using examples helps the model internalize the gray areas and edge cases you care about.\n\n### 3. **Structured Output / Reasoning Steps**  \n- Encourage the LLM to first explicitly restate the user's intent clearly. Then classify the intent as valid or invalid based on your scope.  \n- This two-step reasoning helps the model catch ambiguity and reduces hallucinations.\n\n**Example prompt structure:**  \n```\nGiven a user's request, do the following steps:\n\n1. Clearly restate the user's intended action(s).\n2. Classify each intent as either:\n  - VALID (within allowed actions)\n  - INVALID (out-of-scope or ambiguous)\n\nAllowed actions: create, delete, update channels (no other actions allowed).\n\nExamples:\n- User: \"kinda delete this channel\"  \n  Intent: Delete channel → VALID  \n- User: \"create channel and tell joke\"  \n  Intent: create channel → VALID, tell joke → INVALID. Therefore, overall request → INVALID.\n\nNow classify the following request clearly and explicitly:\nUser: \"[user input here]\"\n```\n\n### 4. **Confidence Thresholding and Ambiguity Handling**  \n- If your gatekeeper LLM outputs a structured classification (e.g., VALID/INVALID), you can also leverage confidence scoring:  \n  - High confidence → proceed  \n  - Medium confidence → human review or clarification prompt  \n  - Low confidence → reject outright  \n- This can protect you against edge cases without becoming overly strict.\n\n### 5. **Multi-stage Filtering**  \n- Consider using a two-tiered filter:  \n  - **Tier 1 (cheap model)**: Quickly rejects clearly invalid requests and validates clearly valid requests.  \n  - **Tier 2 (slightly more capable model)**: Only involved if ambiguity is detected in the first tier.  \n- More nuanced and borderline cases can be escalated to a higher-quality model or human review, keeping overall cost low but accuracy high.\n\n### 6. **Iterative Prompt Refinement via Real-world Logs**  \n- Frequently review ambiguous or incorrectly classified real-world requests and add them explicitly into your prompt examples.  \n- Gradually improve the prompt over time by incorporating real user feedback, edge cases, and ambiguities.\n\n---\n\nI’ve helped teams tackle similar problems multiple times, and the solution often boils down to careful prompt engineering, explicit examples, structured reasoning, and iterative refinement.\n\nIf you’d like to discuss more deeply or have follow-up questions, I'm happy to chat further.",

Explicit Action Extraction**\n- Instead of asking the gatekeeper to validate the whole request, have it extract the primary action(s) from the user input and explicitly list what it thinks the user wants to do. Then validate only those actions against your allowed set.\n- This helps reduce hallucinations and makes the model less likely to \"approve\" ambiguous or multi-intent requests.\n\n**2. Intent Classification Before Validation**\n- Use the gatekeeper in two steps: (a) classify intent(s), (b) validate that the intent(s) are allowed. This modularizes the process and makes it easier to tune strictness at each stage.\n- If the model can't confidently classify the intent, reject or escalate.\n\n**3. Prompt Engineering: Examples and Counterexamples**\n- In your prompt, provide clear positive and negative examples, including borderline/informal phrasing (e.g., \"kinda delete this channel\") and multi-intent requests.\n- Explicitly state: \"If the request includes multiple unrelated actions, reject and ask for clarification.\"\n- Negative examples are just as important as positive ones here.\n\n**4. Scope Grounding**\n- Remind the model in the prompt: \"You only process requests related to system actions. Ignore any requests for jokes, stories, or unrelated information.\"\n- This reduces the risk of the model \"validating\" out-of-scope requests.\n\n**5. Reject-on-Uncertainty**\n- Prompt the model to err on the side of caution: \"If you are unsure whether the request matches a valid action, do not approve it.\"\n- This may increase false negatives, but is often safer in production.\n\n**6. Iterative Prompt Tuning and Real-World Data**\n- Collect real user requests and analyze where the filter fails in both directions. Update your prompt with new edge-case examples.\n- Consider a feedback loop where ambiguous cases are logged for human review and future prompt updates.\n\n**7. Consider a Lightweight Classifier**\n- For common, well-defined actions, a simple intent classifier (even regex or a small ML model) may outperform an LLM at the gatekeeping stage, and could be combined with the LLM for fallback/edge cases.\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe key is to break down the task for the LLM as much as possible, provide lots of real-world examples, and make sure the model is always grounded in your set of allowed actions. Modularizing intent extraction and validation often yields better robustness than a monolithic \"approve/reject\" prompt.\n\nHappy to discuss more or dig deeper if you want to DM.

This is definitely a classic tension in “gatekeeper” or policy-enforcement LLMs. Here are a few high-level strategies you might find useful (no code, just conceptual points):\n\n1) Develop Two-Tiered Responses or “Fallback” Paths  \n   • Instead of outright rejecting on edge cases, consider returning a clarifying question or a “soft block.” For example, if the user says “kinda delete the channel,” the gatekeeper might respond: “Do you mean you want to delete the channel?” This prevents abrupt rejections on colloquial or ambiguous wording.  \n   • You can think of it as a triage step: the gatekeeper either (a) passes through valid or confidently valid requests, or (b) for ambiguous language, returns a minimal follow-up question to clarify user intent.\n\n2) Define Clear Error Boundaries  \n   • Get very explicit about what counts as “definitely invalid,” “valid,” or “potentially valid but ambiguous.”  \n   • For requests that are definitively invalid (e.g., out-of-scope or disallowed actions), the gatekeeper can confidently reject or redirect.  \n   • For requests that are ambiguous, the gatekeeper can prompt for clarification rather than returning a yes/no result.\n\n3) Use Exemplars in Your Prompt  \n   • In your “gatekeeper” prompt, include a variety of real or synthetic examples of borderline or colloquial requests, plus the correct pass/fail (or “needs clarification”) outcomes.  \n   • This gives the model more context for how to interpret real-world variations in phrasing (e.g., “kinda delete,” “possibly remove,” “nuke this channel,” etc.).\n\n4) Emphasize Policy-Driven Reasoning  \n   • If you have a specific internal policy or set of rules for the allowed/disallowed scope, summarize them in your prompt.  \n   • E.g., “Reject if user asks for anything outside the known commands: [list of valid commands]. If uncertain, ask for clarification.”  \n   • This helps keep the gatekeeper “on script” rather than trying to interpret or expand requests beyond those rules.\n\n5) Consider Confidence Thresholds  \n   • If your LLM can provide a confidence score or you can infer one, you could pass only high-confidence acceptances straight to the more expensive model.  \n   • Mid-confidence requests get flagged for manual review or a clarifying question.  \n   • Low-confidence or obviously invalid requests get rejected.\n\n6) Bias Toward Clarification Instead of Hallucination  \n   • Sometimes the best middle ground is having the gatekeeper clarify the user’s intent rather than hallucinate solutions to partial requests.  \n   • If the user says, “create a channel and tell me a joke,” the gatekeeper might respond with something like: “I can help with creating a channel. The ‘tell me a joke’ part is out of scope for this action. Are you sure you want to proceed with creating the channel only?”  \n   • This helps the gatekeeper remain faithful to scope and stops it from drifting into unplanned tasks.\n\n7) Continuous Iteration with Real User Data  \n   • A big piece of the puzzle is capturing real user interactions and feeding them back into your prompt-tuning process. Real world requests often highlight unseen corner cases and slang you might never anticipate until your system is live.\n\nIn practice, you’d blend some combination of these strategies to ensure that borderline or colloquial inputs aren’t instantly rejected. Meanwhile, you avoid letting the gatekeeper “latch onto” random details (“tell me a joke”) that are out of scope.\n\nHope this gives you some new angles to think about! Feel free to reach out if you want to discuss further. Good luck!",

          "response": "It sounds like you’re at the part of the design process where you need to explicitly balance between being too permissive and too rigid. Here are some strategic ideas you might consider:\n\n1. Define a clear taxonomy of intents and actions. One way to do this is to develop a list of acceptable “action keywords” (like delete, create, update, etc.) along with common colloquial expressions that map to these intents. By having a clear internal mapping, your gatekeeper can first “normalize” the language before deciding if the action is within scope.\n\n2. Use multi-step reasoning in your prompt. Rather than asking the model to simply validate the request in one shot, structure the prompt so it:\n  a. Extracts the user’s intent(s) and key parameters.\n  b. Maps these to known valid actions.\n  c. Flags every part of the request that’s ambiguous or potentially off-topic (like an extraneous “tell me a joke”).\nThis chain-of-thought approach might help the model avoid hallucinating additional actions and helps separate primary requests from noise.\n\n3. Consider conditional processing: If a request contains multiple distinct parts (e.g., an action plus a conversation element), you might explicitly instruct the gatekeeper to only validate the component(s) that match the known operations in your system. This can be done by instructing the model to ignore components that fall outside a predefined set (e.g., “If any part of the instructions falls outside the scope of managing channels, please only process the channel-management directives and ignore the rest”).\n\n4. Introduce examples and counterexamples in a few-shot setup. Sharing both positive examples (e.g., “kinda delete this channel” → valid as a delete command) and negative examples (e.g., “create a channel and tell me a joke” should only trigger the create-channel action and flag the joke part as out-of-scope) in your prompt can help the model learn your desired behavior.\n\n5. Build in “fallback” or escape strategies. Ask the gatekeeper to output a structured response that, for example, indicates whether the request is fully valid, partially valid, or needs clarification. This way, if the request is ambiguous (or if it accidentally incorporates out-of-scope instructions), your system can decide to ask the user for clarifications rather than trying to process everything as is.\n\n6. Pay attention to phrasing: As you’ve observed, overly strict wording may choke on colloquial language. One approach is to explicitly mention that synonyms, contractions, or colloquial expressions are acceptable—provided they map cleanly to an allowed action. Similarly, you might instruct the model to “translate” the input into formal system commands before validation.\n\nIn building robust LLM agents, it’s all about decomposing the problem into smaller, easily controlled steps. Experiment with layered prompts: a lightweight initial validator that normalizes and extracts intents, followed by a second check that ensures no extraneous instructions slipped through. This layered approach can provide flexibility without sacrificing safety.\n\nHope these ideas help you break out of your current loop. It seems like you’re on the right track; sometimes, just a small reordering of how the instructions are structured can make a big difference. Good luck with your system!",

If this extraction fails, reject; if multiple actions are detected, prompt for clarification or reject.\n\n2. **Enumerated Allowed Actions**: In the system prompt, explicitly list the set of allowed actions and instruct the LLM to only validate requests that correspond directly to these. If the input includes anything outside this set, return `\"invalid\"` or `\"out_of_scope\"`. This helps prevent hallucinating actions or “stretching” user intent.\n\n3. **Chain-of-Thought Prompting**: Ask the LLM to briefly explain its reasoning before making a decision. This often helps it avoid hallucinating or over-interpreting ambiguous inputs.\n\n4. **Incremental Filtering**: Consider a two-stage filter:  \n   - First, a lightweight check for “obviously invalid or multi-action” requests (using regex, heuristics, or a very cheap LLM call).\n   - Second, a more nuanced LLM prompt for borderline cases.\n\n5. **Instructional Prompt Examples**: Provide explicit positive and negative prompt examples in your system prompt, especially edge cases (colloquial requests, compound requests, etc.).\n\n6. **Temperature and Top-p Settings**: For the gatekeeper, keep temperature low (e.g., 0–0.2) to reduce creativity and stick to explicit instructions.\n\n7. **Continuous Feedback Loop**: Collect logs of both false positives and false negatives, and periodically retrain/refine your prompts using real data.\n\nUltimately, the prompt should encourage the model to be “helpfully literal”—able to map variations of expected intents, but strict about only passing allowed actions. Don’t hesitate to prompt the user for clarification if there’s ambiguity.\n\nHappy to discuss more if you want to DM, or we can keep chatting here.

If yes, pass it on. If no, deny.”  \n   • Provide a short set of categories/allowed actions or policies.  \n   • Once it decides the category, it does not attempt to interpret or fulfill anything else.  \n\n3) Restrain it from being “helpful” in the sense of generating any new content.  \n   • The gatekeeper should never answer beyond “I see the request is [x]. This is valid (or invalid).”  \n   • If it tries to do anything beyond classification/validation, insert a strong system message reminding it not to.  \n\n4) Consider simple “fallback” logic.  \n   • If the user’s request straddles multiple actions—like “create a channel and tell me a joke”—the gatekeeper can break that into two separate tasks. If your policies only allow certain tasks, it rejects or clarifies the part that’s out of scope.  \n   • For borderline or ambiguous language (“kinda delete this channel”), rely on clarifying questions if possible: “So you want to delete the channel, correct?” The gatekeeper can ask for more detail rather than outright rejecting.  \n\n5) Momentum out of confusion.  \n   • Often these LLM guardrail loops happen when the model tries to do too much. Keep the gatekeeper’s scope minimal: “Given the user’s words, identify one of [valid actions: create, delete, rename, etc.] or [invalid request].” If the user’s language is unusual or casual, the guardrail can treat it as synonyms.  \n\n6) Prompt iteration + small test sets.  \n   • Take a curated set of edge-case user prompts that represent your typical tricky scenarios (colloquial or ambiguous requests, multiple combined requests, policy-violating requests, etc.).  \n   • Test any new prompt or gating logic on that set to see where it fails.  \n   • Keep refining the system or the instructions around those specific examples until it’s more robust.  \n\nYou probably know a lot of these, but sometimes it’s reassuring to see other folks take the same path.

          "response": "It sounds like you’re wrestling with the classic trade-off between precision and recall when filtering ambiguous natural language. Here are some strategies and considerations that might help you strike a better balance:\n\n1. Break down the task into multiple passes.\n • Instead of having a single prompt try to decide both what’s being asked and whether it’s safe/valid, consider a two-step approach. For example, the first pass can determine the user’s intent (even if it’s phrased colloquially), and the second pass can check that intent against a whitelist or set of rules for safety.\n • This can allow the system to “translate” a casual instruction like “kinda delete this channel” into the canonical intent “delete_channel.” That intermediate step can reduce misclassification.\n\n2. Use chain-of-thought or justification prompts.\n • Encouraging the LLM to enumerate its reasoning can help reduce hallucinations. For instance, you might ask: “Explain in a few bullet points what the user is asking for and identify the key action(s) before deciding if it’s valid.” If the reasoning indicates that an additional out-of-scope request is mixed in (like a joke request), you can design logic to flag this.\n • This extra reasoning can help temper the model’s tendency to hallucinate by forcing it to work through its answer.\n\n3. Incorporate explicit examples in your prompt.\n • Providing a few examples of colloquial phrasing (and their intended canonical actions) can guide the model. For example, list something like:\n  – “I kinda need to remove this channel” → “delete_channel”\n  – “Set up a new channel and tell me something funny” → Only process the channel setup, ignoring the joke.\n • These examples can set the tone for how flexible the system should be while still maintaining boundaries.\n\n4. Specify what to do in ambiguous cases.\n • For example, instruct the LLM: “If the user request includes more than one action, or if an action isn’t clearly within the supported set, respond by asking for clarification instead of trying to guess.” This can reduce unwanted side effects like processing irrelevant parts of a request.\n • You might also decide to have the model flag or defer any requests that combine unrelated intents.\n\n5. Tune the “strictness” in a modular fashion.\n • Instead of one monolithic gatekeeper prompt, consider separating the filtering into distinct modules: one that recognizes permissible actions (using fuzzy matching or semantic similarity thresholds) and another that checks for extraneous requests. This separation can allow you to adjust sensitivity independently.\n • Experiment with thresholds for how lenient the intent detection should be. In testing, you may find that erring on the side of safety (by asking for clarification) is preferable to the risk of misinterpretation.\n\n6. Introduce a “fallback” mode.\n • Sometimes, despite careful prompting, a message might be too ambiguous or have out-of-scope content. In these cases, a fallback response that asks the user to clarify or break their request into recognized commands can serve as an effective guardrail.\n • For example: “I detected multiple requests—please confirm if you want [the allowed action] and leave out any additional instructions.”\n\nIn summary, a multi-step approach that separates intent extraction from safety validation, along with explicit examples and guidelines for ambiguous cases, can help you get closer to a system that understands casual language yet remains robust against unwanted side effects. Every system may need some iterative tuning to find that “sweet spot” between being too strict and too loose, so don’t be afraid to experiment and adjust based on real-world user inputs.\n\nI hope this offers a helpful perspective on different prompting approaches and architectural strategies.

As an AI assistant without direct experience in building such systems, I can offer some general thoughts and suggestions that may be helpful.\n\nThe tension you describe between being too strict versus too flexible is a common one in designing robust language models. A few key considerations that come to mind:\n\n1. **Scope and Intent**: It's important to be very clear on the specific scope of actions/requests that your gatekeeper model should be validating. Defining the core intents and actions it needs to recognize, as well as any clear boundaries, can help guide the prompting approach.\n\n2. **Contextual Understanding**: Incorporating some level of contextual understanding, beyond just literal parsing, can be crucial. This might involve techniques like entity extraction, sentiment analysis, or even simple dialogue modeling to better grasp the user's true intent.\n\n3. **Iterative Refinement**: Given the potential for edge cases and unanticipated inputs, an iterative approach to prompting and model evaluation is likely necessary. Carefully analyzing failure cases and incorporating that feedback into prompt/model updates could help you converge on a more robust solution.\n\n4. **Robust Error Handling**: Thoughtful error handling and feedback to the user may also be important. Rather than simply rejecting inputs, the gatekeeper could provide useful guidance on how to rephrase or clarify their request.\n\n5. **Leveraging Multiple Models**: Depending on your architecture, you may be able to leverage a pipeline of models, each focused on a specific aspect of validation. This could allow you to combine the strengths of different approaches.\n\nWhile I don't have direct experience to share, I hope these general points provide a helpful framework for your continued exploration and experimentation. I'd encourage you to reach out to others who have tackled similar challenges, as their firsthand insights could be invaluable.\n\nWishing you the best of luck in finding the right balance for your gatekeeper model!",

Here are some high-level strategies and prompting philosophies that might help:\n\n1. Explicitly Separate Intents  \nIf possible, design the prompt to first extract or disambiguate the intent(s) before deciding if the request is valid. For example:  \n*\"Identify the primary user action in the following request. If there are multiple actions, list them separately.\"*  \nThis helps with cases like \"create a channel and tell me a joke,\" allowing your downstream logic to only process the relevant portion.\n\n2. Define \"Valid\" With Examples  \nLLMs respond well to example-driven prompting. Give clear positive and negative examples in your prompt, especially for borderline cases:  \n*Valid: \"delete this channel\", \"kinda delete this channel\"*  \n*Invalid: \"tell me a joke\", \"delete the channel and ban everyone\"*  \nThis often nudges the model to be both flexible and safe.\n\n3. Use a Two-Step Filter  \nInstead of a single strict/flexible gate, consider:  \n- **Step 1:** Is this request in-scope for the system (yes/no)?\n- **Step 2:** What is the intended action (normalized, if possible)?  \nSometimes, chaining two cheap calls is still less expensive than a single heavy model call, and allows tuning each step's strictness.\n\n4. \"Refuse by Default\" for Ambiguity  \nInstruct the model to refuse requests that are ambiguous or out of scope, and to always err on the side of caution (with a specific refusal phrase). This can help with hallucinations.\n\n5. Consider User Feedback Loops  \nIf a request is rejected, provide a helpful, specific reason and suggest a rephrasing. Over time, you can collect and analyze these to refine your prompts (and maybe even tune a small custom classifier).\n\n6. Regularly Evaluate with Real User Data  \nEdge cases always appear in production. Maintain a test set of real, difficult examples and tune your prompts against them, not just synthetic data.\n\n**Summary:**  \n- Use intent extraction and explicit examples.\n- Consider multi-step (or multi-model) gating.\n- Tune prompts with real data and edge cases.\n- Lean on \"refuse by default\" for ambiguous requests.\n\nHappy to discuss more if you want to brainstorm specific edge cases or approaches!",

          "response": "I’ve been down this road myself—balancing “too strict vs. too flexible” can feel like a never-ending see-saw.\n\nA few high-level strategies I’ve seen work:\n\n1. Provide explicit examples of edge cases in the prompt.  \n   • For verbs like “delete,” include all common synonyms or colloquial requests (“remove,” “get rid of,” “nuke,” “kinda delete,” etc.) so the model sees them as valid.  \n   • Mention that any out-of-domain requests with additional instructions (like “tell me a joke”) should either be passed through separately (if your system can handle them) or flagged as “secondary actions.”\n\n2. Split the request into “recognized action” vs. “everything else.”  \n   • Some teams handle the “core action” parsing with the gatekeeper (cheap LLM or even a rules-based approach) and pass everything else (jokes, clarifications, etc.) to a second step if needed. It simplifies the gateway’s job: “Does this sound like a valid action (create, delete, rename, etc.)? If yes, pass it downstream.”  \n   • That way, your gatekeeper’s terrain is narrower—it’s primarily about identifying “Is this a well-formed request for an action we support?” and it can ignore or at least not block peripheral content that doesn’t affect the main action.\n\n3. Use multiple short instructions instead of a single mega-prompt.  \n   • In the prompt for your gatekeeper, try a handful of bullet points:  \n     – “When you see synonyms for ‘delete,’ treat them the same.”  \n     – “If the request includes secondary instructions outside these recognized actions, ignore them or pass them on unvalidated.”  \n     – “If the request is obviously invalid (e.g., incomprehensible, out-of-domain), reject it.”  \n   • Small, direct instructions can sometimes keep the LLM from overthinking or hallucinating.\n\n4. Reinforce “fallback” or “defer when unsure.”  \n   • If you suspect there’s a mismatch (“kinda delete this channel” → looks valid, but wording is unusual), always have the model “ask for clarification” or “defer to a downstream check” rather than outright reject or attempt to interpret it incorrectly.  \n   • That helps avoid blocking valid but strangely worded requests.\n\n5. Data-driven improvements.  \n   • Collect logs of real user phrases the gatekeeper wrongly rejected or wrongly passed, and fine-tune or re-prompt with those examples. Over time, repeatedly inject all those “weird but valid” phrasings into training data or few-shot exemplars.  \n   • This iterative approach usually helps tighten the gatekeeper’s accuracy.\n\n6. Consider a two-pass architecture.  \n   • If you can afford it:  \n     – Pass the user request into a cheaper LLM or embedding classifier to identify the intended “action.”  \n     – Then feed that recognized action into a more robust LLM with guardrails, but with a simpler prompt: “User wants to DELETE channel. Confirm this is safe.”  \n   • It’s a bit more moving parts, but it often reduces hallucination because you’re segmenting the tasks more clearly.\n\nUltimately, the sweet spot usually emerges after you see where your filtering logic is most error-prone. Often, the real fix is either adding “no, that’s valid, just weirdly phrased” examples or instructing the gatekeeper not to handle extraneous user requests (like jokes).\n\nHope that helps—and happy to chat more if you want to dive deeper.

          "response": "It sounds like you’re facing a common tradeoff: you need a filter that’s flexible enough to understand informal or imprecise language while still being strict enough to avoid processing extraneous or unintended parts of the request. Here are a few strategies to consider:\n\n1. Two-Pass/Hierarchical Parsing Approach  \n • One idea is to have an initial “intent extraction” phase where the model identifies the primary action from the user input using a strictly defined list of allowed commands.  \n • In a second stage, you can have the model cross-check the identified intent against the full input to ensure that any additional requests (like “tell me a joke”) aren’t accidentally processed as part of the core action.  \n • This separation can help deal with mixed inputs.\n\n2. Explicitly Define a Controlled Vocabulary  \n • Frame your prompt around a fixed set of allowed actions (e.g., delete, create, update).  \n • Include examples showing paraphrases and colloquial language that correspond to each allowed action.  \n • Ask the model to map informal language to one of these commands or to flag the input as ambiguous if it doesn’t clearly match an allowed intent.\n\n3. Use Clarifying Questions or Request Confirmation  \n • If the input appears to include multiple actions, you could have the filter output a clarification request (“It seems you asked to create a channel and also mentioned another activity. Please confirm which is your primary request.”) rather than trying to process both.  \n • This requires extra round trips but can help reduce errors when the input is mixed.\n\n4. Chain-of-Thought Guidance for Controlled Reasoning  \n • Guide the model to “think out loud” in a structured way (internally, not outputting the chain) so that it first extracts the main command, then optionally notes any extraneous details.  \n • By instructing it to focus on one allowed command and ignore non-essential parts, you can reduce hallucinations. (Be sure to test this thoroughly to ensure that the chain-of-thought isn’t inadvertently output to users.)\n\n5. Negative Examples and Rejection Cases  \n • Consider training your prompt with counterexamples: show inputs that mix allowed and disallowed content, and instruct the model on how to handle them (e.g., “If the input includes any disallowed secondary actions, only process the allowed one; if ambiguity is too high, reject or ask for clarification.”)  \n • This can help strike a balance between being smart in intent extraction and safe by not overstepping.\n\n6. Iterative Refinement and Testing  \n • In practice, you might adopt an A/B testing strategy: monitor how often valid commands are misclassified or how often extra actions are mistakenly processed.  \n • Use this data to continuously refine the prompt wording and instruction hierarchy.  \n • You might even eventually incorporate lightweight rule-based checks alongside the LLM’s natural language processing for extra safety.\n\nBy combining these strategies, you can craft a prompt (or a sequence of prompts) that is robust to natural, illustrative language while still exercising the necessary guardrails. It’s less about “one perfect prompt” and more about designing a modular system that can cross-check and validate user inputs from multiple angles.\n\nHope this helps provide some ideas for your project!",

Keep this prompt flexible and forgiving, allowing colloquial language.\n   - **Stage 2:** Strict validation of the classified intent, ensuring the intent matches a pre-defined domain of allowed actions. This stage can be more rigorous and conservative, explicitly rejecting ambiguous or unsafe requests.\n\n2. **Prompting via Examples (Few-shot)**  \n   Often, attempts at prompt engineering become overly complex rulesets. Instead, consider:\n   - Providing a few clear examples of both valid colloquial requests and invalid/hallucinated cases.\n   - Explicitly demonstrating how ambiguous or multiple-intent statements should be handled (e.g., \"create a channel and tell a joke\" → Response: \"Only the 'create a channel' action is allowed. Reject the rest.\").\n\n3. **Scope-Constrained Output**  \n   Rather than asking the model \"Does this request seem valid?\" in an open-ended way, explicitly ask it to choose from a fixed set of predefined intents and explicitly reject anything else.  \n   For example: \"Given the user's request, select exactly one of the following allowed actions: [delete channel, create channel, modify channel, none]. If unsure or multiple intents are present, select 'none'.\"\n\n4. **Chain-of-Thought Reasoning (CoT)**  \n   Adding a short reasoning step can help. Ask the model to first briefly explain what it thinks the user is requesting before deciding if it's valid. This intermediate reasoning step often reduces hallucinations and improves clarity.\n\n5. **Layered Guardrails**  \n   Consider that no single prompt or model will be perfect. You can layer guardrails:\n   - Primary cheap model gatekeeper (fast, permissive, colloquial-friendly)\n   - Secondary strict validation step (conservative, precise)\n   - Optional fallback (human review or logging for ambiguous edge-cases)\n\nIf you'd like to explore these strategies further or have more questions, feel free to DM me.",

Here are a few strategic perspectives that might help you break out of the loop:\n\n1. Tiered Filtering & Fallbacks  \nConsider a multi-stage validation process:\n- Stage 1: Use a very cheap/fast model (or regexes) to handle obvious rejections (e.g., empty input, profanity, obvious multi-action requests).\n- Stage 2: Hand off to your gatekeeper LLM with a prompt designed for flexibility, but ask it to always return a structured output (e.g., \"intent: delete_channel, confidence: 0.7, secondary intents: tell_joke\").  \n- Stage 3: If confidence is low or multiple intents are detected, route to a human, escalate, or request user clarification.\n\n2. Prompting for Intent Extraction, Not Validation  \nInstead of asking the LLM \"Is this a valid request?\", ask it to extract a single, primary intent (possibly with a secondary intent list). Then, your code can enforce what is allowed/valid, rather than trusting the LLM to \"gate\" everything. This approach reduces the risk of the model hallucinating or being over-literal.\n\n3. Use Natural Language Feedback Loops  \nIf the LLM is unsure, have it return a clarification prompt for the user (\"Did you mean to delete this channel, or something else?\"). This lets you err on the side of flexibility without sacrificing safety.\n\n4. Prompt Engineering with Examples  \nProvide positive/negative examples in your prompt, showing how to handle colloquial phrasing and multi-intent requests. E.g.:\n- \"kinda delete this channel\" → intent: delete_channel\n- \"create a channel and tell me a joke\" → intent: create_channel, secondary: tell_joke (but only process create_channel)\n\n5. Leverage System Instructions & Output Format  \nExplicitly instruct the model:  \n\"Only validate requests that match a single, supported action. If there are multiple requests or unsupported actions, respond: 'Invalid. Reason: Multiple actions or unsupported request.'\"\n\n6. Metrics & Continuous Feedback  \nInstrument your system to log \"near-misses\": cases where valid requests are rejected or invalid ones slip through. Use this data to iteratively improve your prompts and add more/better examples.\n\nHappy to chat more about approaches if you want to dive deeper!

One strategy I’ve found useful is splitting the gatekeeper’s job into two separate tasks, rather than asking a single prompt to do everything at once:\n\n1. Classification layer: First prompt is purely for classification (“Is this request valid, invalid, or ambiguous?”) without trying to interpret or reformulate it. This helps avoid the gatekeeper hallucinating or prematurely transforming the request.  \n2. Interpretation layer: If valid, send the text to a second step, whose job is to convert natural language into the canonical request you want. This step is narrower in scope (“Extract exactly the user’s desired command, nothing else”).  \n\nThat separation often reduces the “strict vs. flexible” tension. You can tune each layer’s prompt independently—one focusing on “is this okay or not” and the other on minimal rewriting or expansions. Then if the user says something like, “kinda delete this channel,” the classifier can still see it as a valid request to delete, and the subsequent interpretation layer clarifies “delete this channel.” On the other hand, if the user tries to combine two unrelated commands (“create a channel and tell me a joke”), the classifier might mark part as valid (the channel-creation) and either flag or ignore the other part.\n\nAnyway, just leaving my two cents—I’d love to hear others’ experiences with similar setups!",

          "response": "It sounds like you’re wrestling with the classic trade-off between precision and recall in natural language interpretation—getting the model to catch all valid intents while not over-interpreting or hallucinating extraneous parts. Here are a few strategies that might help you find that sweet spot:\n\n1. Clarify the Allowed Actions Up Front:  \n • It can help to have the gatekeeper LLM work from a clear, explicit list of supported commands (e.g., \"delete channel\", \"create channel\").  \n • Set strict boundaries so that the model is instructed to only look for those intents. For example, you can explicitly say “If the user message includes anything beyond these predefined commands (or a variant of these), simply ignore it or return an error.” This can curb the tendency to process extra parts like “tell me a joke.”\n\n2. Use a Structured Parsing Phase:  \n • Instead of asking the LLM to directly validate natural language requests, you might have it extract the intent and parameters as a structured output (like JSON or a simple schema).  \n • The output should either match the schema exactly or be rejected. By forcing a fixed format, the model has less room to hallucinate additional functions.  \n • For example, if the user says “kinda delete this channel,” the model could output { \"action\": \"delete\", \"target\": \"channel\", \"confidence\": \"high\" } or something similar. This forces the model to confirm the parts it’s interpreting.\n\n3. Decompose Complex Commands:  \n • In cases where the request might contain multiple intents (like your “create a channel and tell me a joke” example), consider breaking down the input in a first-pass analysis.  \n • You could instruct the gatekeeper to list “recognized commands” and then only pass on the parts that match the permitted actions. Alternatively, the gatekeeper might be designed to flag multi-intent requests as ambiguous.  \n • The warning for such scenarios could be: “If more than one allowed intent is detected, do not process, and return a clarification request.” This prevents the mixing of allowed and out-of-scope actions.\n\n4. Chain-of-Thought or Multi-Step Reasoning:  \n • Sometimes having the LLM “think through” the input in internal steps (and then hidden from the final user response) can help it separate valid command parts from extraneous information.  \n • For instance, you might instruct it first to decide “Is there exactly one permitted action in the text?” and then to extract that action. In production this might involve a two-step call or a prompt that instructs the model not to include its reasoning in the final answer.\n • This separation can reduce the risk that the model’s background reasoning “leaks” into the action, potentially introducing errors.\n\n5. Fine-Tune Prompt Sensitivity with Examples:  \n • Provide a few in-context examples that illustrate borderline cases—like colloquial phrasing—so that the model learns to interpret “kinda delete this channel” as “delete channel.”  \n • At the same time, illustrate examples where additional content (like a joke request) should be trimmed out or cause a fallback rejection.  \n • This kind of few-shot in-context learning can help calibrate the model’s behavior without hard coding too much logic.\n\n6. Consider an Ensemble Approach:  \n • One strategy is to have multiple lightweight gatekeepers checking for different characteristics (one to verify that an intended allowed action is clearly present and another to catch extra disallowed content).  \n • You can then combine their outputs. For example, if one “votes” that the request is valid and another detects an extra disallowed part, you can have a rule that defaulting to “clarification needed” minimizes the risk of mistakenly executing an unintended command.\n\n7. Testing Extensively:  \n • Because these systems are very sensitive to phrasing, it can be invaluable to test a wide range of user inputs—both edge cases and everyday colloquial expressions—to see where the gatekeeper might be too strict or too lenient.  \n • Adjusting the instructions iteratively is key. Sometimes robust error logging and user feedback (where safe) can guide fine-tuning over time.\n\nOverall, the idea is to narrow the permissible interpretations by:\n – Defining a clear schema for valid actions,\n – Encouraging the LLM to parse and then validate the intent against that schema,\n – And rejecting ambiguous or compound requests explicitly rather than trying to process superfluous parts.  \n\nI hope these ideas spark some new directions for your gatekeeper design. It’s all about nudging the model to focus on exactly what’s allowed, and nothing more. Let me know if you want to dive deeper into any aspect!",

Explicit Scoping\nMake sure your prompt makes it very clear what the valid set of actions/intents are. For example:  \n\"Only validate requests that directly relate to channel management (e.g., create, delete, rename a channel). If the request includes unrelated tasks, reject it.\"\n\n2. Stepwise Reasoning\nEncourage the LLM to decompose requests before validation. For instance:  \n\"First, identify all distinct user intents in the request. If any intent is outside the allowed scope, reject the entire request.\"\n\n3. Robust Examples\nProvide both positive and negative examples covering edge cases (colloquial, combined intents, indirect language, etc.). LLMs learn a lot from a handful of well-chosen demonstrations.\n\n4. Conservative Handling of Ambiguity\nTell the model: \"When in doubt, err on the side of rejection. Only pass requests that clearly match allowed intents.\"\n\n5. Consider a Two-Stage Approach\nIf budget allows, you could use an initial fast filter for broad scoping (\"does this mention channel management?\"), then a second, slightly more expensive filter for fine-grained parsing.\n\n6. Non-LLM Pre-filtering\nSometimes a simple keyword or rule-based pre-filter (to quickly catch obvious out-of-scope requests) combined with the LLM for nuanced cases yields the best tradeoff.\n\n7.

This is typically a rough but strict filter—think of it like an initial triage.  \n   • If the request passes this initial test, then feed it into your more nuanced “gatekeeper” prompt, which can parse user intent more flexibly.\n\n2) Make the Gatekeeper Perform “Interpretation, Not Execution”:\n   • Emphasize that the gatekeeper LLM should restate or clarify the user’s request in standard/acceptable language rather than granting or denying final actions.  \n   • If user requests contain secondary actions or tangents (like “tell me a joke”), have the gatekeeper isolate them from the core request. It can then pass the “core request” forward and possibly flag additional user wants as optional follow-ups.\n\n3) Structured Outputs Instead of Free-Form:\n   • Instead of letting the gatekeeper produce a pure text response like “Yes, this is valid,” consider requiring it to output structured data—e.g., {“intent”: “delete a channel”, “valid”: true, “reason”: “User explicitly requests channel deletion”}.  \n   • This structure discourages the model from wandering off-topic and can give you a more predictable way to handle borderline cases or partial requests.\n\n4) Provide Examples of Acceptable & Unacceptable Inputs:\n   • In your gatekeeper’s prompt, include short examples of how to handle borderline instructions. For instance:\n     – “kinda delete this channel” → interpret as “delete channel.”  \n     – “create a channel and tell me a joke” → separate “create a channel” as valid action; note the “tell me a joke” is out of scope for an admin system instruction.\n   • By showing the model examples of transformations or partial acceptance, you reinforce the pattern that it can break multi-part requests into validated tasks and either ignore or call out the rest.\n\n5) Iterative Refinement with Real Logs:\n   • Collect logs of actual user requests that fail or cause confusion. Take these real-world examples, see how the gatekeeper responded, and adjust the prompt or rules. This iterative approach is often more important than any single up-front design.\n\n6) Balance between Strictness and Flexibility:\n   • If you’ve found the model becomes too “strict,” see if your examples or instructions cue it to reject things too aggressively (e.g., words like “kinda,” “sorta,” “maybe”).  \n   • If you see uncontrolled flexibility—where it starts addressing out-of-scope pieces—add a line in the prompt reminding it to “ignore all additional requests unrelated to system actions.”\n\n7) Human-in-the-Loop for Edge Cases:\n   • For especially ambiguous or complex user commands, have the gatekeeper produce a clarifying question or direct it to a human review process. This ensures you don’t block valid requests just because they’re phrased unusually.\n\nHope that helps you refine your approach. Feel free to follow up with more details or questions if you want to brainstorm specific examples or edge cases. Good luck with your gatekeeper system!",

It sounds like you’re wrestling with the classic tradeoff between precision and recall in intent parsing. In my experience building systems with LLM guardrails, a few strategies might help balance smart filtering with robust handling of colloquial language:\n\n1. Clarify user intent in stages. Instead of one monolithic prompt that judges the entire request, consider a two-step approach. First, have the gatekeeper determine the core intent (e.g., “delete this channel”) and output a normalized action. Then, in a second pass, verify if any extraneous requests (like “tell me a joke”) exist. This can help avoid conflating multiple intents.\n\n2. Use explicit instructions for ambiguity. In your prompt, instruct the model to ask for clarification when the intent isn’t clear rather than making assumptions. For instance, if a user writes “kinda delete this channel,” the model might respond with something like “Did you mean to delete the channel? Please confirm.” This has the benefit of keeping the expensive model safe from processing unintended actions.\n\n3. Employ examples in your prompt. Illustrative input–output pairs can guide the model on how to treat colloquial language versus extra, out-of-scope requests. For example, show that “kinda delete this channel” should map to a delete action, while in the presence of dual intents (“create a channel and tell me a joke”), the model should extract and process only those actions that are allowed (and maybe complain or ask about the out-of-scope part).\n\n4. Consider separate routing for multi-step requests. If possible, architect your system so that a request like “create a channel and tell me a joke” is split into two components. Allow the LLM to check against a whitelist of permitted actions, rejecting or flagging anything not clearly within that list. This way, you avoid the possibility of hallucinating or inadvertently processing unintended parts.\n\n5. Leverage external knowledge or rules where possible. If the domain of allowed actions is narrow, consider coupling the filter with a deterministic rule-based system that checks whether the parsed request falls within your supported set. The LLM can produce its best guess, and then the rule-based system can verify it, reducing the risk on edge cases.\n\nUltimately, the right balance might require some experimentation with your prompt’s wording and perhaps multiple rounds of user testing. The idea is to give the model enough context to accurately parse typical, colloquial input without overreaching into areas that might trigger unintended behavior.\n\nHope these ideas help spark the solution you’re looking for!",

Some ideas to consider:\n  - Use intent classification rather than exact matching\n  - Allow for common synonyms and phrasings\n  - Include examples of valid but colloquial inputs in the training data\n  - Implement a confidence threshold and pass uncertain cases to human review\n\n- For out-of-scope actions, you could maintain a whitelist of allowed intents/actions and reject anything not on that list.\n\n- Consider having the gatekeeper model paraphrase or extract the core intent, rather than just approve/reject. This gives you more visibility into its reasoning.\n\n- Iterative testing and refinement with a diverse set of inputs is key.\n\nI hope these general thoughts are helpful for your project!

Here are a few strategy considerations and prompting approaches that might help break the loop:\n\n1. Explicit Action Extraction vs. Intent Classification:\n- Rather than asking the gatekeeper model to \"validate\" the whole request in one go, prompt it to extract the core action(s) and their parameters (e.g., action: delete, object: channel). Once extracted, you can validate these against your allowed actions set. This often reduces hallucination, because the LLM is focused on parsing, not judging.\n2. Enumerate Supported Actions with Examples:\n- In your prompt, list out the supported actions (delete, create, etc.) and provide positive and negative examples, including colloquial/ambiguous ones. For example:  \n  - \"kinda delete this channel\" → Matches: delete  \n  - \"delete this channel and tell me a joke\" → Only process: delete\n- This helps the model learn boundaries without being overly rigid.\n3. Force the Model to Ignore Out-of-Scope Requests:\n- Explicitly instruct: \"If a request contains multiple actions, only extract the ones from this supported list. Ignore or reject unrelated requests (e.g., 'tell me a joke').\"\n4. Chain of Thought for Edge Cases:\n- For ambiguous phrasing, ask the model to first paraphrase or clarify internally before extracting the action. Sometimes, a \"think step\" helps with intent understanding.\n5. Iterative Prompt Tuning with Real Logs:\n- Gather real user requests, including edge cases, and use them to iteratively fine-tune your prompt. There’s no substitute for a representative test set.\n6. Consider Output Format:\n- Use structured output (e.g., JSON: {action: \"delete\", object: \"channel\"}) which you can programmatically inspect, rather than relying on freeform text.\n7. Fallbacks for Low Confidence:\n- If the gatekeeper model is unsure, let it pass the request to the more expensive model for a second opinion, or ask the user for clarification.\nYou're on the right track—this is an iterative process, and the balance is achievable with enough real-world examples.

          "response": "It’s definitely a balancing act. One way to think about it is to structure the gatekeeper prompt so it focuses on three separate “mindsets,” each with its own role:\n\n1. Understanding Instructions:  \n   The system tries first to parse user language for the essential action (e.g., “delete a channel,” “create a channel,” etc.). This is a narrower step: identify the “verb” (and any critical parameters like “which channel?”) and only then decide if the action is in-scope.\n\n2. Validation & Scope Checking:  \n   This step is basically: “Is that action something we (the system) have the power or allowance to do?” and “Is it safe/allowed?” If yes, we pass it through; if no, we stop. For example, if the request is “create a channel and tell me a joke” and telling jokes is out-of-scope, the gatekeeper should confirm the channel creation is valid but ignore the joke. Sometimes, you can have an explicit policy: “This gatekeeper does not respond to questions or creative requests—only to system actions.” Then just do a quick filter.\n\n3. Ambiguity & Reformulation:  \n   When the user phrasing is fuzzy or ambiguous—like “kinda delete”—it’s good to have the prompt re-check whether “kinda delete” is effectively “delete,” or if it means something else. In practice, you can encourage the model to respond with clarifications if it’s truly uncertain. That can be the difference between a refusal and a quick “Do you mean delete the channel?” type of clarifying question.\n\nIn terms of teaching the gatekeeper to handle “mixed requests”—where a single user utterance includes both a system action and something irrelevant (like you said, “tell me a joke”)—one approach is to instruct the gatekeeper to isolate just the actionable command and ignore any additional tangential requests. This is a matter of explicitly telling the model: “When the user asks for multiple things, process only the relevant actions in-scope for the system. If parted instructions are out of scope, do not process them or flag them as not relevant.”\n\nFinally, testing is pretty important: you want to run a battery of edge cases (common colloquial phrases, partially formed commands, extra questions) through and see how the gatekeeper handles them. Every time it fails in a certain way (either false positives or false negatives), you can refine the prompt by adding instructions or examples around those cases.\n\nHope that helps give some fresh perspective!

          "response": "You’re facing a classic trade-off in prompt engineering for filtering user inputs: if your instructions are too literal, you miss nuance in natural language; if they’re too loose, you end up over-processing or misinterpreting mixed intents. Here are some strategies that have worked for others working on similar gatekeeping systems:\n\n1. Hierarchical or staged processing:  \n • First, run a lightweight classifier stage that identifies whether a request is within the allowed set of actions (e.g., “delete,” “create,” “modify”). This classifier doesn’t need to fully parse nuance—it just flags whether the intent is recognized.  \n • Second, if the intent is clear, pass it on to a dedicated “action parser” that can handle variations (like “kinda delete”) by mapping colloquial expressions to canonical commands.  \n • Lastly, if extras are detected (like “tell me a joke”), have a strategy to either strip out or ignore the extra domain of instruction, potentially by focusing solely on the command part.\n\n2. Clear, multi-part instructions:  \n • Instead of one monolithic prompt, consider breaking up the gatekeeper’s instructions into parts: first ensuring that it only judges whether the core action is allowed, and then, in a separate pass, handling or flagging additional requests that stray into other domains.  \n • For instance, instruct the LLM: “Extract the core action from the following sentence. Ignore ancillary requests. If the core action is unclear or out-of-scope, flag it.” This kind of split helps the LLM focus on what matters while ignoring potential noise.\n\n3. Synonym and variant handling:  \n • Incorporate into your prompt a list of known variations so that the LLM understands that “kinda delete” and “please remove” both map to deletion commands.  \n • Mention explicitly: “Consider colloquial or modified versions of allowed commands as valid if the primary intent remains unchanged.” This helps prevent over-rejection of valid requests.\n\n4. Use of system-controlled meta-rules:  \n • Add meta-instructions that tell the gatekeeper to disregard or ask for clarification if multiple intents are present. For example, “If the user’s input includes more than one distinct request, only process the part that corresponds to an allowed action and ignore the rest.”  \n • This strategy can prevent the model from attempting to process out-of-scope elements like jokes or chit-chat.\n\n5. Iterative testing and refinement:  \n • As with many prompt-engineering challenges, real-world testing with diverse inputs is key. Analyze false rejections (valid commands that were missed due to colloquial language) and false acceptances (inputs with extra, problematic instructions).  \n • Iteratively refine your prompt based on these edge cases, perhaps even incorporating feedback loops where ambiguous cases get flagged for manual review or additional clarification.\n\n6. Temperature and sampling adjustments:  \n • Consider adjusting parameters like temperature to reduce the likelihood of the model “hallucinating” additional instructions or straying from the core directive. A lower temperature can help keep the output tightly focused on the gatekeeper’s rules rather than creative interpretation.\n\nThe underlying theme is to decompose the task so that each stage of processing handles a clearly defined subtask: detecting intent, parsing colloquial language, and discarding irrelevant parts. By doing so, you can isolate the noise without compromising the essential function.\n\nKeep in mind that the right balance might not come out perfectly on the first try; it’s a matter of iterative refinement and testing against realistic inputs from your target audience. With time, you’ll likely find that these modular approaches provide both the safety of strict checks and the flexibility to handle the breadth of natural language. \n\nDoes this align with the challenges you’re facing, or are there specific edge cases where you’d like more targeted suggestions?",

Few-shot examples in your prompt**\nInclude examples that show both acceptable variations and clear boundaries:\n```\nValid: \"kinda delete this channel\" → delete_channel\nValid: \"nuke the channel\" → delete_channel  \nInvalid: \"delete the channel and tell me a joke\" → only delete_channel is valid\n```\n\n**3.

Let’s break down how your protagonist—a whistleblower—could interact with, or be affected by, such a \"gatekeeper\" LLM system, and how this could heighten tension, drive plot, or reveal character.\n\n**1. The System as an Obstacle**  \nThe gatekeeper LLM acts as a digital bouncer, filtering requests to the central, more powerful AI system. In your story, this could be a security layer protecting sensitive data—think government secrets, evidence of corruption, or plans for a nefarious project. Your protagonist, needing to expose the truth, must get past this intelligent filter.\n\n**2. Navigating the Filter**  \nBecause the system is designed to block ambiguous or invalid requests, the protagonist faces two possible problems:\n- If they’re too direct (“Give me all top-secret files”), the gatekeeper flags and blocks them.\n- If they’re too vague or colloquial (“Kinda wanna see those files?”), it might not parse the intent or might flag the request as suspicious.\n\n**3. Tension Through Language**  \nYour hero might need to:\n- Carefully craft their queries, learning the system’s quirks—perhaps even trial and error, and the stress of “one wrong word and I’m locked out or flagged.”\n- Collaborate with an inside ally or a linguist/hacker who understands prompt engineering, adding a subplot or side character.\n- Outwit the filter by mimicking “normal” user requests or hiding their true intent in innocuous language, building tension as they walk the line between strict and flexible prompts.\n\n**4. The System’s Flaws as Plot Points**  \n- The protagonist could exploit the filter’s flexibility: If it sometimes hallucinate or overextends (“create a channel and tell me a joke”), maybe they sneak a real request through by piggybacking it on harmless chatter.\n- Or, the system’s strictness becomes a hurdle: It rejects even honest, urgent pleas for help if not phrased “correctly,” ramping up stakes in a critical moment.\n\n**5. Themes and Symbolism**  \n- The gatekeeper LLM becomes a metaphor for institutional barriers: even when the truth is known, bureaucracy and red tape (here, algorithmic) block justice.\n- The protagonist’s struggle to communicate with the system mirrors their struggle to be heard in society.\n\n**6. Climactic Use**  \n- Maybe at the climax, the protagonist must word a single, crucial request perfectly to trigger action—tension rides on their ability to speak the system’s “language” under pressure.\n\n**In summary:**  \nBy embedding the gatekeeper LLM as both a technical and narrative barrier, you can create suspense, challenge your protagonist in unique ways, and explore broader themes of communication, bureaucracy, and truth. The system’s balance between strictness and flexibility is not just a technical detail, but a living obstacle in your story’s world.\n\nIf you’d like, I can suggest specific ways your protagonist might experiment with prompts or describe a scenario where the gatekeeper LLM nearly foils their mission!",

          "response": "One way to weave this sort of “gatekeeper LLM” dynamic into a superhero whistleblower story is to treat it as a high-stakes security tool that the protagonist either has to develop, subvert, or expose. Below is a conceptual outline of how you might integrate the technical dilemmas into your narrative:\n\n1) Introduce the Gatekeeper System as a Corporate (or Government) Innovation:\n   • The powerful organization in your story—perhaps a major defense contractor or government AI lab—develops this gatekeeper system to control access to an even more potent AI. This system has legitimate reasons to exist: the AI is so resource-intensive and potentially dangerous that only validated requests can go through.  \n   • Show how the gatekeeper LLM (the “filter”) is meant to be cheap and fast, scanning user requests for validity and blocking anything illegal, unethical, or outside of the AI’s licensed capabilities.\n\n2) Highlight the Tension Between “Strict” and “Flexible” Filters:\n   • Early in the story, the gatekeeper starts blocking everyday language or ambiguous phrases, causing frustration among employees or civilians trying to do their jobs. This hints that the filter is too strict.  \n   • In other cases, the filter is fooled by clever prompts and allows unscrupulous requests to pass through. This happens because the system is ironically too flexible, missing crucial context.  \n   • These contradictory failures generate suspicion and unrest within the organization—and possibly the city at large—about whether the gatekeeper truly provides any safety or value.\n\n3) The Whistleblower’s Role:\n   • Your protagonist is a data scientist, AI ethics researcher, or a specialized engineer who initially works on building or refining the gatekeeper’s prompt.  \n   • They notice that management is pushing for a certain threshold of “strictness,” but it’s actually training the system to reject conversations that question the company’s motives. Conversely, some “splinter group” manipulates the filter to allow covert operations.  \n   • Realizing innocent requests are being censored (and dangerous ones sometimes slip through), your protagonist grows skeptical of the entire setup.\n\n4) Moral and Personal Stakes:\n   • The hero struggles with whether to blow the whistle: the gatekeeper is presented publicly as a safeguard, but behind closed doors it’s controlling which voices get heard, possibly stifling internal critics or whistleblowers.  \n   • Because it’s cheaper to just block any borderline request, the gatekeeper becomes a convenient tool for silent, large-scale censorship—and that is what your protagonist sets out to expose.  \n   • Alternatively, if your story is more action-oriented, perhaps an underground group tries to hack or bypass the gatekeeper to unleash the “super-powerful AI” resources it protects—leading to high-stakes conflicts.\n\n5) Show the Technical Complexity:\n   • Through the protagonist’s eyes, readers learn that “prompt engineering” is not just toggling settings; it’s a delicate balance. Your protagonist experiments with different prompt phrasings, discovering:\n       – Too strict: everyday speech gets flagged; normal tasks fail.  \n       – Too flexible: the model tries to handle everything—jokes, scamming requests—leading to chaotic or even dangerous outcomes.  \n   • Reveal that these misfires aren’t just technical hiccups; they have moral and legal consequences when requests are wrongfully blocked or maliciously approved.\n\n6) Turning Point / Climactic Reveal:\n   • Recognizing that no one else sees (or admits) the danger, the protagonist collects evidence of the system’s misbehavior—transcripts of normal folks locked out of simple tasks, along with logs of unethical requests getting through.  \n   • Part of the intrigue could be a showdown with the more formidable “main” AI, which only operates on gatekeeper-approved requests. The whistleblower might realize that if they can slip a crucial piece of evidence or a particular command through the filter, they gain access to the logs or can broadcast the truth.  \n   • This sets up a dramatic conflict: the gatekeeper stands as an obstacle—or a possible ally—depending on how your protagonist can manipulate the prompt constraints.  \n\n7) Resolution:\n   • The final confrontation might see the gatekeeper failing due to its flawed prompt design, or being forced into a scenario where it must process a request outside its normal parameters. This reveals the overarching moral: attempts at absolute control through an imperfect filter often backfire or enable new kinds of abuses.  \n   • The whistleblower’s actions either dismantle the technology, expose the corruption behind it, or force sweeping changes in how the gatekeeper is governed.\n\nBy treating the gatekeeper system’s “strict vs. flexible” dilemma as a central plot device—and showing that the moral and societal stakes hinge on how effectively it screens requests—you’ll give readers a tangible sense of the real-world complexities your protagonist is fighting to divulge. That contrast between the idealistic reasons for building such a tool (to protect everyone) and the practical ways it can be subverted (censorship, power consolidation, shadowy manipulations) can drive both the technical intrigue and the superhero drama.",

Morgan stumbles upon confidential internal documents outlining the ambitious design of a so-called “gatekeeper” system. This system uses an intermediary language model to sift through user requests before they reach a more potent, highly expensive core model. \n\nIn one tense flashback, Morgan remembers overhearing a heated discussion among the system’s engineers. They debated how to craft the perfect prompt: too rigid, and everyday, colloquial commands like “kinda delete this channel” would be unceremoniously rejected; too lenient, and even harmless requests with a side of humor—like “create a channel and tell me a joke”—might cause the system to overreach and attempt tasks it wasn’t meant to handle. The engineers argued over balancing nuance, context, and safety. Their voices overlapped, frustrated by an endless loop, trying to capture the precise trade-off between smart interpretation and strict control.\n\nNow, as Morgan pores over code snippets and email trails on a flickering monitor in a grimy backroom, they visualize how the gatekeeper’s prompt would function in real time. Morgan reconstructs scenarios in their mind: a user casually typing an informal command, the LLM gatekeeper parsing the intent, and then deciding whether to pass the command on or filter it out. Morgan notes the dangers—the risk of the system shutting down legitimate actions because it misreads casual language, or worse, executing unintended operations when whimsical requests bleed into critical functionality.\n\nIn a dramatic internal monologue, Morgan reflects on the moral and technical stakes: “This isn’t just about efficiency; it’s about trust. When a system is overly strict, it alienates real users. But if it’s too flexible—if it pretends to understand when it really doesn’t—it becomes a ticking time bomb.” They envision a future where this delicate balance could save lives or, conversely, exacerbate chaos if misused by those in power.\n\nThe narrative builds tension as Morgan prepares to leak the findings. They decide to demonstrate the gatekeeper’s vulnerabilities by simulating queries on an isolated, controlled version of the system. One exchange shows the prompt rejecting an innocuous, casual request, while another reveals the system agonizing over a compound query, mistakenly processing only part of it. This concrete evidence paints a vivid picture: the company’s technology is a Frankenstein creation—cute and clever on the surface but dangerously flawed beneath.\n\nIn this way, the technical struggle with balancing strictness and flexibility isn’t just a background detail—it becomes a core allegory of the story. It mirrors Morgan’s own journey, as they fight against a system that, like the gatekeeper, was designed without true empathy for human nuance. This discovery ignites Morgan’s resolve to expose the hidden dangers of the overly rigid yet flawed mechanisms controlling society, setting the stage for a showdown that questions whether technology should serve power, or truly empower the people.",

          "response": "Absolutely, this is a classic tension in LLM-based \"gatekeeper\" systems, especially in Security Studies contexts where both reliability and safety are critical. Here are some strategic considerations and approaches that might help clarify your thinking:\n\n**1. Prompt Framing:**\n- **Explicit Instructions:** Instead of asking the LLM to decide \"is this valid?\", break the task into two steps: (a) extract the actionable intent, and (b) check if the intent matches the allowed set. This tends to reduce hallucinations and over-flexibility.\n- **Force Structure:** Use prompts that demand a structured output, e.g.,  \n  ```\n  Extract the ACTION and OBJECT from this request. If unclear or out-of-scope, respond \"INVALID\".\n  ```\n  This reduces the likelihood of the model improvising or combining multiple requests (e.g., \"create a channel and tell me a joke\").\n\n**2. Few-Shot Prompting with Edge Cases:**\n- **Diverse Examples:** Include both \"strict\" and \"slang/colloquial\" examples in your prompt, showing how to map `\"kinda delete this channel\"` to the correct intent, but reject `\"tell me a joke\"`.\n- **Negative Examples:** Explicitly show cases where the model should reply \"INVALID\" or \"OUT OF SCOPE\". This sharpens the boundary.\n\n**3. Intent Classification First:**\n- Before allowing the LLM to process the request, have a lightweight classifier (could be a smaller model or even rules) tag requests as \"single actionable intent\", \"multiple intents\", or \"unclear\". Only pass \"single actionable intent\" forward.\n\n**4. Decomposition:**\n- Instruct the model to reject or flag multi-intent requests. For example,  \n  ```\n  If the request contains more than one action, respond \"MULTIPLE INTENTS\".\n  ```\n  This helps address `\"create a channel and tell me a joke\"`—the filter doesn't need to hallucinate which part to process.\n\n**5. Post-Processing/Consensus:**\n- Run the same request through the gatekeeper several times (with small variations, e.g., temperature), and only pass if all agree. This can catch hallucinations or inconsistent passes.\n\n**6. Human-in-the-Loop for Gray Areas:**\n- For requests that are ambiguous or fall between strict/flexible, you can flag for human review rather than make a hard decision.\n\n**7. Continuous Evaluation and Feedback Loop:**\n- Regularly collect false positives/negatives and tune your prompts and few-shot examples accordingly. Real user data is extremely valuable here.\n\n**Strategic Principle:**  \nAim to make the gatekeeper's job as *narrow* as possible—\"Is this a valid, single, actionable request in the allowed set?\"—rather than overloading it with understanding or improvisation.\n\n**Final Thought:**  \nYou may never get it 100% right out of the box—gatekeeping is inherently adversarial and context-dependent. But with careful prompt design, structured output, and ongoing adjustment, you can get very close.\n\nIf you want to discuss specific prompt formulations or edge cases, feel free to DM or post follow-ups!",

          "success": false,
          "response": "Here are a few directions you might consider when refining your gatekeeper prompt and overall strategy, based on common approaches others have taken:\n\n1) Use a Two-Pronged Structure in the Prompt  \n   • Establish Hard Constraints: Explicitly describe which types of requests must be categorically rejected or flagged. Give clear examples of “forbidden” instructions or high-risk areas.  \n   • Provide Flexible Parsing Guidance: In a separate section, let the LLM know it should interpret colloquial or indirect language but only within certain boundaries (e.g., queries that match known valid commands). This can reduce overly strict failures by nudging the model to interpret user requests flexibly, but still within the scope you define.\n\n2) Emphasize Strictness on Intent, Flexibility on Language  \n   • Have the gatekeeper assess the request’s intent based on function rather than phrasing. For example, “kinda delete this channel” → recognized as “request to delete channel.”  \n   • In your examples/few-shots, use varied natural language (“remove,” “nuke,” “delete,” “get rid of,” “kinda remove…”) so the LLM learns to reliably interpret the underlying action. Then clearly specify that only requests fitting known actions (e.g., “create,” “delete,” “update,” etc.) are valid, and everything else should be flagged as out-of-scope.\n\n3) Implement a Tiered Classification  \n   • Instead of letting the gatekeeper decide pass/fail in one shot, first classify the request into “recognized valid action,” “recognized invalid action,” “uncertain or multi-action request,” etc. A second short step can then finalize whether to pass or reject the request.  \n   • This ensures that out-of-scope or ambiguous requests (like “create a channel and tell me a joke”) are first recognized as multi-action, and then the gatekeeper can decide if it should partially fulfill (just create the channel) or reject/ask for clarification on the second request (the joke).\n\n4) Leverage “Chain-of-Thought” but Keep It Internal  \n   • In the prompt, instruct the gatekeeper to reason internally (chain-of-thought) but only output a concise final decision (pass or reject).  \n   • This can help it unpack nuanced queries, but avoid revealing confusion or partial reasoning to the user. Instead, you see the final pass/fail plus a short explanation for your logs or debugging.\n\n5) Build a Library of Edge Cases and Iteratively Refine  \n   • Gather real user queries that are borderline. Introduce them into your prompt as additional few-shot examples, refining explanations each time you see an unexpected rejection or acceptance.  \n   • Over time, you’ll develop a stable set of patterns (colloquialisms, synonyms, multi-part requests) that the LLM handles gracefully.\n\n6) Consider a Hybrid Approach (Heuristic + LLM)  \n   • Pre-filter with a lightweight, rule-based system that handles straightforward spam/scam or obviously invalid requests. This helps your gatekeeper LLM focus on more nuanced, borderline questions (reducing risk of hallucinations on trivial cases).  \n   • If the request is complex or ambiguous, feed it into the LLM-based gatekeeper for deeper reasoning.\n\n7) Make Guardrails Explicit and Self-Referential  \n   • Start your system prompt with lines like: “You are a validation assistant. You have the following valid commands: [list them]. You should not accept any request that does not map to exactly one valid command.”  \n   • This clarity helps reduce confusion: the LLM sees exactly what’s in-bounds and is more likely to either interpret the request as a valid command or reject it.\n\nIn practice, the sweet spot is an iterative process:  \n• Start with a lean, explicit policy.  \n• Gather test queries (especially borderline ones).  \n• Check the gatekeeper’s responses.  \n• Adjust instructions and examples accordingly.  \n\nBecause user requests can get creative, a single pass might never achieve 100% accuracy. But by combining clearly delineated valid commands, a short library of exemplars for flexible interpretation, and a fallback or multi-tier approach for ambiguous inputs, you can significantly reduce both false positives (overly strict) and false negatives (overly permissive).",

          "response": "Below is an overview of strategies and considerations that might help you build a robust “gatekeeper” system for filtering natural language requests, along with relevant context from security studies and system design. This summary draws on experiences from LLM system deployments and research in LLM prompting alongside established safety practices.\n\n1. Understanding the Trade-offs\n\n• The Strict vs. Flexible Dilemma:  \n  – A too-strict gatekeeper may misinterpret casual language (for example, mistaking “kinda delete this channel” as something ambiguous or non-authorized).  \n  – A too-flexible gatekeeper risks overstepping its role and attempting to interpret parts of requests unrelated to the allowed actions (like “tell me a joke” when only channel-related actions should be processed).\n\n• Robustness and Reliability:  \n  – The gatekeeper must reliably catch malicious, ambiguous, or out-of-scope requests before the expensive LLM call while not harming usability by rejecting valid requests.  \n  – This reflects classic security vs. usability trade-offs seen in many real-world systems. The challenge becomes balancing safe filtering with natural language flexibility.\n\n2. Prompt Design Considerations\n\n• Layered or Multi-step Prompts:  \n  – Instead of a single prompt attempt at both validation and interpretation, consider a two-stage or multi-turn approach. First, classify the intent or action domain; second, verify if it falls within allowed boundaries.  \n  – For example, first parse out the intent (e.g., “delete”, “create”) and then check if that intent is authorized in the user's context. This separation of concerns can help prevent hallucination or over-extension of the gatekeeper's role.\n\n• Embedding Examples and Context:  \n  – Using few-shot examples can guide the LLM to understand the range of acceptable expressions. For example, include both formal and colloquial variants in your context to demonstrate that “kinda delete” is acceptable when the intent is clear.  \n  – Providing contrasting examples where compound requests (like including a joke request) should trigger a “partial validation” or a safe “reject” for the extraneous component can help tune the model’s response.\n\n• Clear and Explicit Instructions:  \n  – The gatekeeper prompt should emphasize what actions are “in-scope” and which phrases or requests are out-of-scope.  \n  – “If a user request includes multiple actions, prioritize validating the channel management request and ignore any irrelevant queries.”  \n  – This explicit instruction can minimize the risk of the model hallucinating details outside the intended domain.\n\n3. Safety and Security Guardrails\n\n• Tailored Output Taxonomy:  \n  – Design the output of the gatekeeper to be a structured classification—perhaps a JSON that includes fields like “action_type,” “validity,” “confidence,” and “explanation.”  \n  – A clear structure helps downstream systems handle ambiguous or compound requests safely.\n\n• Redundancies and Escalation Paths:  \n  – Incorporate fallback mechanisms where if the gatekeeper’s confidence is low, the system asks for clarification rather than passing the request to the expensive model immediately.  \n  – Implement logging and runtime audits to monitor potential gatekeeper failures, a practice informed by security studies on defense-in-depth.\n\n• Prompt Robustness Testing:  \n  – Evaluate your prompt with a diverse dataset that simulates colloquial language, ambiguous statements, and compound requests.  \n  – Iteratively refine the prompt based on false positives (valid requests rejected) and false negatives (unsafe requests approved).  \n  – This is analogous to penetration testing in security studies, where the goal is to identify weaknesses in a filter or guardrail.\n\n4. Engineering and LLM Agent Considerations\n\n• Modularization:  \n  – Rather than letting a single large prompt carry the burden of decision-making, break down the task into several modules (e.g., intent recognition, scope checking, and then a decision layer).  \n  – This allows for more targeted tuning and easier debugging when something goes awry.\n\n• Domain-Specific Fine-Tuning:  \n  – If possible, consider fine-tuning or at least conferring domain-specific instructions to the gatekeeper model. Fine-tuning on a carefully curated dataset of valid and invalid requests can improve performance.  \n  – This strategy has parallels in threat modeling: by “training” your gatekeeper on known ambiguous cases, you might reduce misclassifications.\n\n5. Strategic Approaches for Your Thesis Project\n\n• Comparative Studies of Prompt Designs:  \n  – Consider designing experiments that vary prompt strictness vs. flexibility. Compare performance across a range of test inputs to gather empirical data on error rates.  \n  – This quantitative approach can provide empirical evidence to support your hypothesis.\n\n• Theoretical Foundations in Security Studies:  \n  – Your work can draw on theories of access control and defense-in-depth. The gatekeeper functions like an access control filter—rejecting requests that don’t meet policy criteria.  \n  – Discussing how human behavior (colloquial language, nuance in intent) interacts with algorithmic safety filters can yield rich insights for your thesis.\n\n• Collaboration with Peer Experts:  \n  – Engaging with researchers who have tackled LLM agent safety strategies—via comments, discussion groups, or even informal interviews—can yield qualitative insights that supplement your experiments.\n\nIn summary, the key lies in deconstructing the task: separating the recognition of colloquial intent from the validation of allowed actions, using layered step-wise prompting, and incorporating structure into your responses. By iteratively testing these approaches and framing them within broader security studies concepts, you should be able to arrive at a balanced, robust solution that meets both usability and safety requirements.\n\nThis comprehensive strategy not only addresses the immediate prompt balancing issues but also aligns with security studies’ emphasis on risk mitigation and proper guardrail design—a combination that should make for a strong component in your thesis.",

          "response": "Here's a quick rundown of key developments in machine learning, NLP, and system design during the 2010s that might give you a bit of context, especially when thinking about designing robust LLM pipelines and guardrails:\n\n1. Early 2010s – The Revival of Deep Learning & Precursor Tools  \n• In the early part of the decade, deep neural networks started to make a splash—in computer vision with breakthroughs like AlexNet.  \n• In NLP, methods like Bag-of-Words were common, but the seeds were being planted for distributed representations. Tools like GloVe and early word embeddings began laying the foundation for better language understanding.\n\n2. Mid-2010s – Emergence of Distributed Representations & Sequence Models  \n• Around 2013, word embeddings such as Word2Vec popularized contextual representations (albeit static ones). They changed the way software processed language, making the leap from strict rule-based systems towards statistical methods.  \n• Concurrently, sequence-to-sequence models and early recurrent networks (including LSTMs) started to gain ground for tasks like translation and summarization. This was also the period when the conversation around system safety, guardrails, and controlling model outputs began to surface, especially as these methods were applied in real-world, user-driven applications.\n\n3. 2017 – The Transformer Revolution  \n• The introduction of the Transformer architecture in the 2017 “Attention is All You Need” paper was transformative. It provided models with the ability to capture extensive context and enabled a leap in capabilities for tasks from translation to text generation.  \n• This architecture paved the way for highly scalable models that, on one hand, improved the “smart” capabilities of language understanding but, on the other, introduced fresh concerns about controlling output and managing unintended behaviors. This development ties into your gatekeeper challenge: balancing rigorous filtering with the flexibility to understand natural, colloquial language.\n\n4. Late 2010s – Scaling Up & Emergence of Early Large Language Models  \n• By 2018–2019, large language models (LLMs) like GPT-2 showcased impressive generation capabilities, signaling a move toward more “powerful but expensive” models.  \n• These advances highlighted a critical need: robust guardrails. As these models became ubiquitous in applications—ranging from chatbots to content moderation—the importance of filtering and validating user requests grew. Developers started experimenting with layered systems where a cheaper, lean model could pre-process or “gatekeep” inputs before engaging a larger, resource-intensive model.  \n• This era also saw early experiments in prompt engineering and refining responses to be both safe and context-aware—precisely the tightrope you’re walking with your validation system.\n\nSo, in a nutshell, the 2010s were the decade when modern deep learning and NLP really took shape. They moved from relatively simplistic statistical methods to a world of large-scale, context-sensitive neural architectures. This transformation has led to both incredible capabilities and new challenges (like reliably filtering user inputs) when deploying LLMs in real-world applications.\n\nThis historical context might help frame some of the trade-offs you're considering in your gatekeeper design: earlier systems valued strict rule-based approaches (often failing on colloquial language), while later developments pushed for more flexible, context-aware models (which sometimes overreach into unintended interpretations). Balancing these perspectives remains a central challenge in designing modern AI agents.",

Here are some strategic approaches that often work well:\n\n**Multi-layer validation approach:**\n- Use a simple, fast model for obvious rejections (profanity, completely off-topic)\n- Then a more nuanced model for intent classification\n- Finally, a constraint checker for scope validation\n\n**Prompt design strategies:**\n- Define \"valid intent categories\" explicitly rather than just \"valid/invalid\"\n- Use few-shot examples that cover edge cases like colloquial language\n- Separate intent extraction from scope validation (two different tasks)\n- Include confidence scoring - let borderline cases through with flags\n\n**Handling the colloquial vs. hallucination tension:**\n- Focus the gatekeeper on \"intent classification\" rather than \"request validation\"\n- Let the downstream model handle the actual feasibility/scope checking\n- Use explicit lists of supported actions in your prompt\n- Consider a \"clarification needed\" category for ambiguous requests\n\nThe key insight many find helpful: make your gatekeeper *permissive* for intent recognition but *strict* for scope boundaries.\n\nRegarding the timeline question about the 2010s - could you clarify what specific domain or context you're asking about?",

Explicit Task Extraction  \nInstead of a binary \"valid/invalid,\" prompt the gatekeeper to extract the user's intended action in a structured way. For example:  \nExtract the main action (e.g., \"delete channel\") and ignore unrelated requests.  \nIf the model can't map intent to a known action, reject.  \nThis helps with colloquialisms (\"kinda delete this\") because the model focuses on mapping to supported actions, not just matching exact phrases.\n\n2. Use Stepwise Reasoning  \nPrompt the model to reason step-by-step:  \na) What is the user asking?  \nb) Is it a supported action?  \nc) Are there any out-of-scope or unsafe parts?  \nThis often improves reliability and reduces hallucination because the model \"thinks aloud.\"\n\n3. Provide Examples and Counterexamples  \nGive the gatekeeper lots of \"do\" and \"don't\" examples:  \n- Do: \"delete this channel\" → Valid: delete channel.  \n- Do: \"kinda delete this channel\" → Valid: delete channel.  \n- Don't: \"create a channel and tell me a joke\" → Valid: create channel; Ignore: tell joke.  \nThis helps the model distinguish between supported and unsupported requests, and handle colloquial language.\n\n4. Require Justification  \nAsk the model to explain its decision. If it can't justify mapping \"kinda delete this\" to \"delete,\" it may highlight uncertainty, which you can use as a signal to escalate, log, or review.\n\n5. Layered Filtering  \nIf you still find edge cases slipping through, consider:  \nFirst pass: Cheap rules or regex to catch obvious invalid/unsupported requests.  \nSecond pass: LLM gatekeeper with structured, example-rich prompts.  \nThird pass: Expensive, full LLM for ambiguous cases or escalation.\n\n6. Tune for Overlap, Not Perfection  \nAim for the gatekeeper to be slightly over-inclusive (so valid requests aren't blocked), but log/flag ambiguous or multi-intent requests for human review or fallback handling. Perfection at this layer is usually not possible—think of it as a \"probabilistic bouncer\" rather than a firewall.\n\n7. Prompt Template Example  \n\"Given the user's request, extract the main supported action from this list [list of actions]. Ignore any unrelated or unsupported instructions. If no main action is found, say 'Invalid.' Justify your answer.\"  \nThis sets up a clear contract and reduces hallucination.\n\nYou’re not alone in this challenge—most mature LLM agent systems use some version of this layered, structured, example-driven approach. Happy to chat more if you have specifics or want to brainstorm edge cases!\n\nLet me know if any of these resonate or if you want to dive deeper into one angle.",

          "response": "I’ve definitely wrestled with that problem—the trade-off between safe/strict and flexible—when designing LLM guardrails. One strategy that’s sometimes overlooked is “constraining language” in the prompt, where you explicitly define what you want the model to consider valid or not valid, and then instruct it to produce structured outputs (like JSON) that commit it to a certain format. For instance, you can explicitly say:\n\n1. “You are a gatekeeper. You only respond with a JSON object containing either an approval or denial reason.”  \n2. “Do not provide any additional text or commentary.”  \n3. “Valid requests are those that match X, Y, Z…” (list out in plain English).  \n4. “Invalid requests are those that do not strictly match any of the valid patterns or are ambiguous.”\n\nIf the output deviates from this structure, you treat it as a malformed (i.e., invalid) response. That method helps reduce the chance of the gatekeeper “going rogue” and analyzing content in a more creative/hallucination-prone way.\n\nSecond, you can append something like, “If you are uncertain about the user’s request, always classify as potentially invalid and require rephrasing or clarification.” This does mean you’ll occasionally push users to reformulate their request, but it ensures that borderline cases get a second pass.\n\nAnother approach is to have a small set of “example inputs” with the kind of colloquial or combined requests you know might cause confusion. Show in your system/message prompt exactly how those should be handled. That gives the gatekeeper a pattern to follow when faced with similarly tricky user language.\n\nLastly, you can place a short chain-of-thought (or hidden reasoning) after the user query within the prompt—something telling the gatekeeper to reevaluate what the user’s real intent is. You specifically instruct the gatekeeper not to share that chain-of-thought, but to produce a final decision of “pass” or “fail.” This can help the model parse the user’s language more carefully without exposing its internal reasoning.\n\nHope those stepping stones help you fine-tune that balance!

          "response": "When thinking about a “gatekeeper” for an IoT world where devices and services interact seamlessly, you’re essentially building a filter that acts as a safety net before a costly or critical action is executed. Here are a few strategic ideas and thought experiments on how to strike the right balance between being smart (understanding natural, colloquial language) and safe (not overstepping into tasks or hallucinating):\n\n1. Use multiple layers of analysis. Rather than expecting the LLM to handle everything in one go, consider a two- or multi-step process:\n  • First: A classification phase that “understands” the intent. For example, you could have the LLM extract the intended operation (delete channel, create channel, etc.) regardless of subtle modifiers like “kinda.”\n  • Second: A validation phase that checks whether only the verified and in-scope intent gets passed on while safely ignoring or flagging extraneous parts (like attempting to tell a joke in the same request).\nIn IoT contexts where actions on devices have physical or security implications, such multi-layer filtering minimizes the chance of unintended actions.\n\n2. Incorporate examples and boundary conditions into your prompt. Providing the gatekeeper with a context “cheat sheet” of acceptable formulations versus examples that should be flagged can help overcome the too‑strict/too‑flexible dilemma. This list can include colloquial phrasings so that the model learns that “kinda delete” means “delete,” but something like “create a channel and tell me a joke” needs to be split into discrete actions (or possibly rejected for multi-action requests).\n\n3. Consider explicit disambiguation. In highly connected IoT scenarios, adding a “clarification” step might be critical. If the input is ambiguous or includes multiple commands, your system could be designed to ask a clarifying question like “Did you mean to delete the channel or perform another task?” This not only protects against hallucination but also aligns with safe practices in command execution.\n\n4. Leverage schema or intent templates. Instead of outright “letting” the LLM decide, you might have it first map the natural language input to a structured schema (e.g., action: “delete”, target: “channel”) before evaluating whether this meets your safety criteria. In an IoT ecosystem where devices often operate in an interdependent, fully connected manner, such structured intents can help centralize validation and logging for compliance and audit purposes.\n\n5. Iterative testing and contextual tuning. With IoT deployments, contexts can vary widely. Running your gating mechanism through simulations with both “natural” human language and edge-case technical commands might reveal gaps in how the prompt handles colloquialisms versus strictly defined commands. Establishing a feedback loop will allow you to fine-tune which phrases or sentence structures are too loosely interpreted and which valid intents get discarded.\n\nIn essence, your gatekeeper technology in a fully connected IoT world becomes a crucial trust anchor. It must smartly translate human intent without accidentally overstepping or creating hazards that could cascade across devices. Balancing flexibility and strictness then becomes a continuous design challenge—a trade-off where safety often trumps spontaneity, but user experience must remain intuitive.\n\nThese are not hard-and-fast rules but rather guidelines that can evolve as you define the acceptable spectrum of commands in your environment. Iterative design, explicit clarification requests, and multi-step validation can help anchor trust in a network where every decision might have a very real consequence.",

I've worked on similar gatekeeper strategies before. Here are some thoughts on how I've seen this tackled successfully:\n\n### 1. **Two-Step Validation (Intent Classification → Action Validation)**  \nBreak down your gatekeeping prompt into two distinct sub-tasks:\n\n- **First step (intent classifier):**  \n  Have the initial prompt ONLY classify the general intent from a limited set of allowed intents. This step doesn't execute or validate complex details—it just identifies \"delete,\" \"create,\" \"modify,\" \"query,\" \"irrelevant,\" etc.  \n  Example inputs like `\"kinda delete this channel\"` clearly map to `\"delete\"` intent.\n\n- **Second step (action validator):**  \n  Once you have a clear intent classification, do a more thorough validation check (another cheap LLM call or simple semantic check) to confirm that the action specified is indeed valid, safe, and within scope.  \n  Inputs like `\"create a channel and tell me a joke\"` get flagged at this stage because the intent classification (\"create\") is valid, but the second half (\"tell me a joke\") is out-of-scope.\n\n### 2. **Prompt Engineering Strategies to Improve Accuracy**  \nAdjust your prompt to explicitly instruct the LLM to:\n\n- **Focus strictly on intent identification:**  \n  \"Your only task is to classify the user's intent clearly. Do not perform or expand actions.\"\n  \n- **Leverage clear examples:**  \n  Provide positive AND negative examples. Include borderline or colloquial examples that you explicitly label as valid or invalid:\n  ```\n  Valid: \"kinda delete this channel\" → intent: delete\n  Invalid: \"delete this and also tell me a joke\" → intent: invalid (mixed actions)\n  ```\n\n- **Explicitly define boundaries:**  \n  Clearly state in the prompt what constitutes an out-of-scope or invalid request:\n  ```\n  - Requests containing multiple distinct actions are invalid.\n  - Requests containing actions outside [list of supported intents] are invalid.\n  ```\n\n### 3. **Confidence-Based or Multi-Agent Validation**  \nIf allowed by your infrastructure, introduce a lightweight second opinion:\n\n- Use two cheap gatekeepers with slightly different prompt styles (one stricter, one more flexible). Only pass requests forward if both gatekeepers agree, or flag requests for manual review if they disagree.\n- Alternatively, you could use confidence scores from your initial classification and set thresholds for confidence-based escalation.\n\n### 4. **Iterative Prompt Refinement with Real Data**  \nCollect real-world user inputs that your current prompt struggles with. Iteratively fine-tune your prompt using these examples. Often, small wording adjustments or adding critical examples can significantly improve performance.\n\n---\n\n**TL;DR recommendation:**  \nSplit the filtering mechanism into separate intent classification and detailed action validation stages. Provide explicit boundary examples and definitions. Consider multi-gatekeeper checks or confidence-based thresholds. Iterative refinement with real examples helps immensely.\n\nIf you'd like to chat further or have more detailed questions about prompt strategies, feel free to DM me.",

For your \"create a channel and tell me a joke\" example, it would identify two separate intents: [VALID: channel_creation] + [OUT_OF_SCOPE: entertainment]. Then you can route accordingly.\n\n**Confidence Scoring**: Have the gatekeeper output a confidence score alongside its decision. Requests in the middle confidence range could either go to human review or get passed through with additional context about uncertainty.\n\n**Layered Validation**: Use multiple lightweight checks rather than one complex one - perhaps a simple keyword/pattern filter first, then semantic validation, then scope checking.\n\n**Few-shot Examples**: Include edge cases in your prompt examples, especially those colloquial cases that are failing. Show the model how \"kinda delete\" maps to valid delete intent.\n\n**Structured Output**: Force the gatekeeper to respond in a structured format (JSON) that separates intent recognition from validation decisions.\n\nThe key insight is often that trying to make one prompt handle both understanding colloquial language AND maintaining strict boundaries is asking too much of a single step.\n\nI've worked through similar guardrail challenges in production systems.

Here’s a logical framework and some high-level strategies for thinking about your \"gatekeeper\" LLM setup:\n\n### 1. **Explicit Task Modeling**\n- **Define Allowed Actions:** Start by making a clear, exhaustive list of the actions your system should support (e.g., create_channel, delete_channel).\n- **Intent Extraction:** Rather than “valid/invalid,” frame the gatekeeper as a classifier or extractor: “What is the user trying to do?” If it can't match to a known action, it should reject or ask for clarification.\n\n### 2. **Two-Step Reasoning**\n- **First:** Parse intent and check for ambiguity (“Is this request clearly for one of the allowed actions?”)\n- **Second:** Only if unambiguous, pass along; otherwise, respond with an error or ask for clarification.\n\n### 3. **Prompt Engineering Guidelines**\n- **Few-shot examples:** Provide the gatekeeper LLM with a range of good and bad examples, especially edge cases (colloquial, multi-intent, out-of-scope, etc.).\n- **Explicit Rejection:** Make it clear in the prompt that if the request is ambiguous, multi-intent, or out-of-scope, the gatekeeper should reject or escalate.\n- **Intent Disambiguation:** Encourage the LLM to ask clarifying questions if the intent is unclear, rather than trying to “auto-correct” or guess.\n\n### 4. **Guardrail Layering**\n- **Rule-based pre-filter:** Consider combining the LLM with a lightweight rules engine for outright obvious cases (e.g., regex for “joke” or known out-of-scope triggers).\n- **LLM as fallback:** LLM should handle only the ambiguous, nuanced cases.\n\n### 5. **Iterative Feedback**\n- **Log and analyze failures:** Routinely review false positives/negatives and update your examples and prompt instructions.\n- **Continuous improvement:** This is an iterative process—edge cases will pop up and prompt tuning never really ends.\n\n### 6. **Idempotence and Safety**\n- **Be conservative:** When in doubt, the gatekeeper should prefer to reject/question rather than let an unintended action through.\n- **User Experience:** Consider the user flow for rejected/unclear requests—can you escalate or ask for clarification smoothly?\n\n---\n\n**In summary:**  \nThe best results usually come from a hybrid: rules for the easy stuff, and an LLM with a well-crafted prompt (including many edge-case examples) for the tricky, ambiguous stuff. Always bias toward safety (reject/ask when unsure), and keep a close feedback loop so you can tune prompts and logic over time.\n\nIf you want to chat specifics or brainstorm tricky cases, happy to continue the discussion!",

          "response": "Below is a conceptual framework that many teams use as a starting point when developing a “gatekeeper” or “policy enforcement” LLM prompt. It’s worked in various enterprise contexts but can be adapted to smaller setups as well.\n\n──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n1) Articulate the Core Policy and Its Scope\n──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n• The first step is to define precisely what the gatekeeper is allowed to approve, what it must reject, and what it should pass along for further clarification.  \n• You want something that looks like a condensed rule set or “pseudocode” of decisions, ideally driven by real product/policy requirements.  \n• The narrower and clearer the scope, the better the gatekeeper can focus—so try not to let it also handle tangential tasks like “tell me a joke.”  \n\nExample:  \n• Approval: Requests that match certain verifiable system actions (“create channel,” “delete message,” “rename folder”).  \n• Rejection: Requests that are ambiguous (“do that one thing we talked about”), out-of-scope (“treat my headache”), or disallowed for policy reasons (“access user passwords”).  \n• Pass for Clarification: Requests that are incomplete or borderline but might be valid with a small re-ask (“kinda delete this channel” → “Do you want to delete channel X?”).  \n\nA compact, explicit set of bullet points is often easier for an LLM to check against—like a short checklist it must consult.\n\n──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n2) Separate the Parsing Step from the Judgment Step\n──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nRather than having the gateway LLM do everything at once (“parse + judge + reason about jokes, etc.”), it’s helpful to break down the workflow:\n\n• Parsing/Interpretation:  \n  Let the LLM restate the user’s intent in a standardized or canonical form. This can be as simple as a JSON structure: e.g., { “action”: “delete_channel”, “target”: “#random” }.  \n\n• Validation/Judgment:  \n  Evaluate whether that structured intention is allowed. If valid, pass the canonical request forward. If borderline, ask clarifying questions. If disallowed or incomplete, reject or route to a fallback.  \n\nEven if you use the same LLM or the same prompt, conceptually splitting “what is being asked?” from “can we do it?” helps reduce the chance that the model “hallucinates” extra tasks in its final answer.  \n\n──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n3) Implement a “Clarify or Confidently Reject” Heuristic\n──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n• If the model is minimally confident that the request is valid but not perfectly parsed (e.g., “kinda delete channel”), it should produce a clarifying question prompt: “Which channel do you want to delete?” rather than outright rejection or naive acceptance.  \n• If the request is definitely out of scope or disallowed (“tell me a joke while you create the channel”), the gatekeeper returns something like: “This gatekeeper only handles system commands. Please refine your request.”  \n\nThis approach helps avoid the extremes of being overly strict or too lenient: you can treat borderline queries as “clarification needed.”\n\n──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n4) Use Meta-Cues in the Prompt\n──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nWhen designing the gatekeeper prompt, explicitly instruct the model how to handle complex or multi-part instructions:\n\n• “If the request is purely for system actions and is unambiguous, parse it into our official syntax.”  \n• “If the request includes additional content outside the domain (like jokes), ignore or remove that content from the final parse and provide a clarifying note.”  \n• “If the request is unclear even after reasonable interpretation, ask a short clarifying question.”\n\nThese meta-cues, repeated in bullet form within the gatekeeper prompt, often help the LLM avoid mixing in “extra tasks” or hallucinating solutions.\n\n──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n5) Provide Examples of Edge Cases\n──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nFew-shot examples (if your context window allows) that show how to parse borderline or colloquial requests are extremely valuable. You can systematically pick real cases from user logs or theoretical edge examples:\n\n• Example 1: “kinda delete this channel.”  \n  → Gatekeeper: “I interpret that as delete_channel(#random?). Please confirm the exact channel.”  \n\n• Example 2: “create a channel and tell me a joke.”  \n  → Gatekeeper: “System portion: create_channel(#some_name). Additional request: telling jokes is out of scope. Please refine.”  \n\nSeeing these demonstrations reduces the model’s guesswork on how you want it to behave.\n\n──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n6) (Optional) Use Confidence or Uncertainty Thresholding\n──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nIf your LLM system supports confidence scoring or can approximate self-evaluation, you can incorporate thresholds:\n\n• If the LLM appears more than, say, 70% confident that the request is valid, it processes it.  \n• If it’s between 40–70% confidence, it prompts for clarification.  \n• Below 40%, it rejects the request or flags it for manual review.  \n\nWhile LLMs don’t have direct “confidence scores” out of the box, some proxy for uncertainty—like the model’s own chain-of-thought or a second pass that tests consistency—can approximate this. This is an advanced approach and may require experimentation.\n\n──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n7) Iterate and Test with Real Data\n──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nFinally, the best theoretical approach still needs empirical tuning:\n\n• Gather logs of actual user queries, see where the gatekeeper incorrectly rejects or incorrectly passes.  \n• Adjust the prompt instructions or add more/better examples.  \n• Conduct “adversarial tests” where you or teammates submit confusing or borderline requests to see how the gatekeeper handles them.  \n\nIn practice, you’ll likely do a few rounds of prompt updates to dial in the balance.\n\n──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nConclusion\n──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nBalancing flexibility with strictness is a classic tension in building an LLM-based workflow. The guiding principle is usually to separate “understanding the request” from “deciding if it’s allowed,” and to provide fallback paths (like clarifying questions) for requests that hover in the grey area. A layered prompt structure (or even a small chain of LLM calls) can be an effective blueprint.  \n\nHopefully these strategic considerations help you refine your gatekeeper logic. It’s normal to go through a few iterations before the model reliably hits the right level of restrictiveness vs. helpfulness. Good luck!",

          "response": "One useful way to think about the problem is to imagine that you’re building a two‐stage interpreter for natural language commands. At its core, you’re trying to map ambiguous, user-friendly language into precise, formal actions—but you must do so in a way that is both:\n\n • Sensitive enough to interpret colloquial or imprecise input (minimizing false negatives), and  \n • Strict enough to prevent unintended or out-of-scope actions (minimizing false positives).\n\nOne theoretical logical framework for this is a combination of controlled natural language processing and formal logic-based safety checking, which can be broken down like this:\n\n1. Semantic Normalization as a Parsing Step  \n • You first use a semantic parser (or an LLM acting in that role) that “normalizes” or “maps” natural language into a structured, formal representation of intent.  \n • Think of it as translating “kinda delete this channel” into a normalized command like DELETE(channel) despite the informal phrasing.  \n • In classical logic terms, the parser is extracting predicates (like DELETE) and arguments (the channel identifier) from a noisy natural language input.  \n • Here, fuzzy logic ideas or probabilistic semantics may be useful to allow a degree of uncertainty (i.e., “kinda” should still land you in the realm of DELETE commands when the contextual clues match).\n\n2. Formal Verification and Guardrail Checks  \n • Once you have a formal representation, you apply a set of rule-based checks. These rules are your safety and validity constraints.  \n • For example, if a request includes multiple actions (“create a channel and tell me a joke”), the system might be designed to only allow a single, clearly defined action, or to split the request according to permitted vs. prohibited categories.  \n • This is like using a logic engine to verify that all “predicates” (actions) are within a white-listed set of allowed operations.  \n • In some systems, you might even use aspects of deontic logic (reasoning about obligations and permissions) to formally state what is allowed and what is forbidden.\n\n3. Integrating Probabilistic and Deterministic Reasoning  \n • The gatekeeping system needs to balance the inherent uncertainty of natural language with the determinism required for a safe command interface.  \n • In practice, this means designing prompts that encourage the LLM to first recast a command in a formalized “intent language,” then apply strict rules.  \n • This is analogous to combining probabilistic inference (handling ambiguity) with deterministic rule evaluation (ensuring safety).\n\n4. Iterative Refinement Through Meta-Reasoning  \n • One can also add an extra “meta layer” where the system reflects on its own interpretation: if it detects multiple intentions or ambiguities, it can flag or ask for clarifications rather than pass potentially hazardous commands along.  \n • This approach uses self-questioning strategies that are akin to meta-logical reasoning where the system checks its own derived propositions against a set of safety axioms.\n\nOverall, the theoretical framework you’re implicitly working with is a hybrid of semantic parsing (to manage colloquial inputs) and formal logic (to guarantee that only safe, well-understood commands are passed on to the expensive downstream model). The challenge is setting the right thresholds in the semantic parser (to capture enough nuance) and designing the rule-checking layer (to strictly enforce boundaries). In a perfect design, the probabilistic interpretation of vague language is tempered by deterministic guardrails ensuring that any ambiguity is resolved in a controlled, safe manner.\n\nIn summary, you’re looking at a layered logical system where:\n\n – The input is mapped from natural language to a controlled, formal language (semantic parsing, fuzzy logic aspects), and  \n – That formal language is then run through a rigorous, rule-based system (formal logic, deontic logic, or even constraint programming) that validates whether the command meets your criteria for safety and scope.\n\nSuch a framework isn’t necessarily implemented by a single “prompt” but often by an architecture that encourages a clear separation between interpretation and verification. This separation can help you handle the balance between flexibility (understanding colloquial language) and strictness (preventing out-of-scope actions).",

          "response": "Theoretically, the logical framework for your \"gatekeeper\" validation approach would involve a layered classification and intent-matching model. Here's how you might structure the thinking from a theoretical/logical perspective:\n\n### 1. Intent-Based Logical Framework\n- **Intent Identification**:  \n  At the core, your gatekeeper is essentially performing intent classification. The logical framework here is to classify user statements into clearly defined intents.\n  - **Allowed Intents**: Operations that your powerful model is explicitly designed to handle (like \"delete channel,\" \"create channel,\" etc.)\n  - **Disallowed or Undefined Intents**: Any other intent is considered invalid or out-of-scope.\n- **Intent Fuzziness and Ambiguity**:  \n  Natural language inherently involves ambiguity. Thus, the logical framework must explicitly account for \"fuzzy intents.\" For example, \"kinda delete the channel\" expresses uncertainty but still clearly maps to an allowed intent (\"delete channel\"). The theoretical framework here might involve Bayesian reasoning or fuzzy logic, where the model assigns a probability or confidence threshold to each intent.\n\n### 2. Hierarchical Reasoning\n- **Two-Step Validation (Hierarchical Architecture)**:\n  - **Step 1 (Gatekeeper)**: Lightweight intent classification.  \n    - Goal: Identify explicitly allowed intents with high-confidence thresholds.\n    - Reject clearly out-of-scope or ambiguous requests that can't be confidently classified.\n    - If uncertain, either rephrase or clarify with the user, or alternatively, escalate.\n  - **Step 2 (Expensive Model)**: Only receives requests the gatekeeper has validated.  \n    - Goal: Perform the expensive operations knowing input intents are pre-filtered.\n\n### 3. Logical Guardrails & Constraints\n- **Guardrails as Logical Constraints**:  \n  The gatekeeper prompt itself should be viewed as a logical constraint system:\n  - **Strict Constraints**: Clearly defined allowed/disallowed verbs and actions.\n  - **Flexible Constraints**: Allowing some linguistic variation, synonyms, colloquial expressions, and minor spelling/grammar errors.\n- **Constraint Hierarchy**:  \n  You might adopt a hierarchy of constraints:\n  - **Hard Constraints**: Actions absolutely forbidden under any circumstances.\n  - **Soft Constraints**: Actions that require additional confirmation or clarifications.\n  - **Permissive Constraints**: Actions that can be immediately approved given a confidence threshold.\n\n### 4. Confidence Thresholding and Probabilistic Logic:\n- Instead of binary logic (strictly allowed vs. strictly forbidden), your theoretical framework should incorporate probabilistic reasoning:\n  - **Confidence Thresholds**:  \n    Each classified intent can have a confidence score. You can theoretically tune these thresholds based on empirical validation data.\n  - **Uncertainty Handling**:  \n    A clear theoretical strategy for uncertainty handling, such as:\n    - Clarify/rephrase (\"Did you mean delete the channel?\")\n    - Escalate to a human moderator.\n    - Pass through with a warning for further validation (if the expensive model has its own safeguards).\n\n### 5. Prompt Engineering as Logical Specification:\n- View your prompt as a logical specification:\n  - Define the allowed intents explicitly, but include examples of colloquial forms (e.g., \"kinda delete,\" or \"please just dump this channel\") to teach the gatekeeper that linguistic flexibility is acceptable.\n  - Explicitly exclude irrelevant intents (\"tell me a joke\") or label them clearly as out-of-scope.\n- Logical Structure of Prompt:  \n  Your prompt can follow a structured logical form, explicitly specifying:\n  - **Valid Actions**: [\"delete channel\", \"create channel\", ...]\n  - **Invalid Actions**: [\"tell jokes\", \"make small talk\", ...]\n  - **Ambiguous Phrases and Examples**: Add clarifications like \"if uncertain or partially ambiguous, request clarification or reject.\"\n\n### 6. Theoretical Principles for Optimal Balance:\n- **Principle of Least Privilege**:  \n  Allow only explicitly permitted intents. When in doubt, reject or clarify.\n- **Principle of Graceful Degradation**:  \n  If the system cannot confidently validate an intent, it should fail gracefully—clarify, escalate, or reject clearly.\n- **Principle of Linguistic Robustness**:  \n  Explicitly define a linguistic flexibility margin. Clearly documented examples (colloquial expressions, slight misspellings, hedging terms like \"kinda,\" \"maybe,\" \"might\") help the model generalize appropriately.\n\n### Summary of Logical/Theoretical Framework:\n- **Intent Classification**: Core logical layer.\n- **Hierarchical Validation**: Gatekeeper → Powerful model.\n- **Logical Constraints/Guardrails**: Hard vs. soft constraints.\n- **Probabilistic Reasoning**: Confidence thresholds and uncertainty handling.\n- **Structured Prompt Specification**: Explicitly cover allowed actions, examples, colloquial variations to balance flexibility and strictness.\n\nBy clearly defining intents and constraints, explicitly modeling ambiguity, and applying probabilistic logic principles, you can refine your gatekeeper prompting strategy to strike the optimal balance of safety, robustness, and flexibility.",

Did you mean ‘delete this channel’?”).\n\n6) Iterate and measure.  \n   • Keep a small but evolving test suite of real user queries (or well-designed synthetic ones) that capture borderline cases.  \n   • Each time you refine your prompt, measure how many test queries it correctly classifies (valid vs. invalid).  \n   • Track any new failure modes that appear and incorporate them into your test suite.\n\n7) Plan for longer-term prevention.  \n   • Even after you’ve dialed in the prompt, new user patterns or new features may emerge.  \n   • Decide how you’ll monitor real user queries and periodically re-audit or refresh your prompt strategy.\n\nIn short, treat your gatekeeper prompt like a mini-classifier that needs tuning against a benchmark of tricky inputs. By methodically collecting edge cases, mapping failure types, and iterating on your instructions in small, controlled ways (while measuring changes in performance), you can find a stable middle ground that rejects truly invalid requests without overzealously blocking users’ natural ways of saying things.",

          "response": "You can approach your analysis of this “gatekeeper” system along several dimensions. Here are some strategies and angles to consider:\n\n1. Define the scope and constraints clearly.  \n • What exactly qualifies as a valid request?  \n • What kinds of “colloquial” expressions are acceptable, and what are the common patterns?  \n • What does “out-of-scope” mean in your context (e.g., extra actions like adding a joke)?\n\n2. Map out the trade-offs.  \n • Strict prompts improve safety by rejecting ambiguous inputs but risk false negatives for valid colloquial expressions.  \n • Flexible prompts can capture the rich variety of natural language but may over-interpolate and process unintended parts of compound requests.  \nAnalyze both sides by listing out potential failure modes (e.g., misclassification of valid intent or hallucinations).\n\n3. Deconstruct user inputs into components.  \n • Look at how composite commands (like “create a channel and tell me a joke”) can be parsed or segmented.  \n • Consider a multi-stage approach: first, intent extraction (what is the primary action?) followed by validating whether extras are in-scope.  \nThis might help mitigate the “hallucination” problem when instructions combine multiple intents.\n\n4. Iterate with interactive testing.  \n • Assemble a dataset of user requests that include edge cases—various levels of formality, multiple intents, ambiguous syntax—and run them through your gatekeeper prompt.  \n • Analyze false positives/negatives, and look for patterns where the model misinterprets or oversteps the intended scope.\n\n5. Explore separation of concerns.  \n • Consider whether the gatekeeper should only flag the “core” actions, leaving additional commentary (like jokes) to be handled separately or ignored.  \n • Ask: Should the gatekeeper “strip away” extraneous parts, or should it simply decide whether the entire input is acceptable? Analyzing this design decision can help you refine the guardrails.\n\n6. Strategy for prompt design.  \n • Experiment with layered prompting: start with a validation step to extract intent, then a tertiary step that verifies if only intended actions are contained.  \n • Think about incorporating “fail-safes” where the model explicitly states what part of the input led to a rejection. This can guide iterative improvements.\n\n7. Evaluate performance metrics.  \n • Define clear metrics such as accuracy in intent detection, false rejection rate, and the fraction of safe responses.  \n • Use these metrics to calibrate your prompt—tweaking the “strictness” until you reach a balance between safely filtering requests and correctly handling valid, natural language input.\n\nBy breaking down your analysis along these lines, you can clearly identify where your system is succeeding or failing, and then adjust your prompt strategy accordingly. It’s a process of iterative refinement where each experiment provides insights into the trade-offs between safety and flexibility. \n\nIn summary, analyze both the technical and linguistic aspects of your gatekeeper model:\n • Identify and catalog the variety of user inputs.\n • Examine how subtle language differences affect interpretation.\n • Consider multi-stage or modular prompting to separate intent extraction and validation.\nThis type of analysis should help you see the “big picture” while also addressing targeted issues, ultimately leading to a more robust and reliable gatekeeper system.",

Here are some key considerations and strategies to help you refine your approach:\n\n**1. Define \"Valid\" Requests Precisely**\n- **Enumerate Valid Actions**: Have a clear, explicit list of what constitutes a valid request. This gives the gatekeeper a strong anchor.\n- **Edge Case Handling**: Document examples of borderline cases (e.g., slang, multi-action, ambiguous phrasing) and decide on consistent handling.\n\n**2. Prompt Engineering Strategies**\n- **Instruction Clarity**: Your prompt should emphasize what to accept and what to reject, with examples. For instance:  \n  *Accept only requests that clearly map to a single supported action. If the request is ambiguous or contains multiple actions, reject it.*\n- **Few-shot Examples**: Include positive and negative examples (covering colloquialisms, multi-intent, etc.) in the prompt.  \n  *Input: \"kinda delete this channel\" → Accept as 'delete channel'*  \n  *Input: \"create a channel and tell me a joke\" → Reject (multiple actions)*\n- **Explicit Rejection Criteria**: Tell the LLM exactly when and why to reject.\n\n**3. Balance Flexibility and Safety**\n- **Paraphrase Normalization**: Encourage the LLM to paraphrase or normalize colloquial requests before validation.\n- **Ambiguity Handling**: For unclear requests, prefer safe rejection or a clarifying follow-up rather than risky acceptance.\n\n**4. Iterative Feedback Loop**\n- **Eval Set**: Build a test set with a wide variety of requests (including real user data, if possible). Continuously test gatekeeper outputs.\n- **Human-in-the-Loop**: Periodically review rejections and acceptances for drift or failures, and update your prompt/examples accordingly.\n\n**5. Out-of-Scope Detection**\n- **Scope Priming**: Be explicit in the prompt about what is out-of-scope, and demonstrate with negative examples.\n- **\"One Action Only\" Rule**: If your system only supports one action per request, stress this in the prompt and in your examples.\n\n**6. Model Choice and Cost**\n- For the gatekeeper, use a fast, small model, but be aware of its limitations in nuance. Consider fine-tuning if you have enough data.\n\n**7. Avoiding Hallucination**\n- Make it clear that the gatekeeper should not attempt to \"interpret\" or \"improvise\" on requests beyond its defined scope.\n\n---\n\n**In summary:** The most robust systems use explicit instruction, strong positive/negative examples, and continuous evaluation/iteration. As you refine your prompt, keep a growing list of test cases to ensure your gatekeeper stays both \"smart\" and \"safe.\"\n\nIf you want to discuss specific prompt wordings or edge cases, or want to share anonymized examples, feel free to elaborate!

          "response": "Below are a few high-level considerations that tend to come up when designing a “gatekeeper” LLM prompt and system. These aren’t strict rules but rather guiding questions to help you iterate more effectively:\n\n1. Precision vs. Recall (False Positives vs. False Negatives):\n   • Decide your tolerance for false positives and false negatives. Is it worse for the system to let bad requests slip through (false negative) or to reject good requests (false positive)? Your gate prompt tuning might change based on whether user experience or system security is the higher priority.\n\n2. Task Clarity and Scope:\n   • The narrower and more concrete the gate’s instructions, the more reliably it can classify. If you allow broad, open-ended interpretation, the model may try to “help” by performing tasks or providing creative interpretations. You might consider enumerating “safe” or “valid” user requests clearly (in a bullet-point list or short policy description) rather than relying on the model to extrapolate.\n\n3. Use of Exemplars (Positive and Negative):\n   • Provide the gatekeeper LLM with examples of acceptable variations of the same request (e.g., “kinda delete this channel,” “delete channel,” “please remove the channel”). Also show it borderline or disallowed examples that it must reject (e.g., “delete that thing and hack user accounts”).\n   • Good exemplars give the model more clarity on how flexible it should be with phrasing vs. out-of-scope behaviors.\n\n4. Multistep or Tagging Approach:\n   • Sometimes one prompt tries to do two things: interpret the user request and pass a single yes/no verdict. A simpler approach is to first identify the type and the scope of user requests (e.g., “Delete channel,” “Tell a joke,” “Ambiguous request,” etc.), then have a short second step that decides whether to reject or forward. Separating these steps can cut down on hallucination by making it obvious which part of the prompt is classification vs. which part is final decision.\n\n5. Prompt Robustness and Guardrails:\n   • Make sure the gate prompt explicitly states what it should not do (e.g., “Do not combine or modify user instructions if you are unsure—only interpret them. If the request includes multiple actions, identify them accurately but do not attempt to resolve them in unexpected ways.”).\n   • Use meta-language carefully; LLMs sometimes treat phrases like “you can say yes or no” as hints to exploit or generate undesired content. Instead, phrase your rules in direct and unambiguous terms.\n\n6. Iterative Tuning and Checking Edge Cases:\n   • Gather real or synthetic user queries, run them on your gate prompt, and see where it fails. Systematically group these failures into patterns (e.g., “user used unusual slang,” “user combined multiple actions,” “user asked for an out-of-scope function,” etc.). \n   • Tweak the prompt to address each pattern, then re-test to see if it introduced new sources of error elsewhere.\n\n7. User Feedback Loop (If Possible):\n   • If end-user friction is a concern, consider letting them know why something was flagged and provide an option like “Rephrase” or “Confirm intent” (assuming the domain allows a short explanation). This can help in borderline cases where the gatekeeper is uncertain but not certain enough to confidently reject.\n\n8. “Default Pass” vs. “Default Deny”:\n   • If you’re truly unsure, do you want the gate to block or to let the next stage handle it? Sometimes the safer strategy is to pass uncertain requests (with a clear “maybe” annotation) to the more powerful system, which can then apply safer or more nuanced filtering. Other times, you might prefer to default to blocking.\n\n9. Monitoring and Logging:\n   • Keep track of each decision and user input so you can see when mistakes happen. This visibility allows iterative improvement in both your prompt design and your overall system.\n\nWith these motivations in hand, you’ll have a clearer roadmap for building, tuning, and testing your “gatekeeper” system. The crux is to isolate responsibilities, provide explicit examples of edge cases, and accept that iterative refinement (with real or realistic user data) will probably yield the best results.

          "response": "When designing a gatekeeper LLM prompt that has to both “get” colloquial intent while remaining safe and within scope, here are several key considerations to keep in mind:\n\n1. Define a clear scope of allowed actions first. Be explicit about what the system is meant to validate. This “boundary definition” helps the LLM know which parts of a user query are acceptable and which might fall outside of allowed operations.\n\n2. Handle ambiguity and multi-intent requests. Users might bundle requests together (e.g., “create a channel and tell me a joke”). Decide in advance whether your gatekeeper should filter out messages with multiple intents or if you need a mechanism (like splitting or clarifying questions) to handle them. This also means guiding the model on what to do if it sees multiple instructions and whether to process only a valid part or to reject the entire query.\n\n3. Allow for colloquial language while preserving command integrity. You want the filter to understand variations like “kinda delete” as meaning “delete.” Consider pre-processing or having the LLM “normalize” the intent such that colloquial modifiers are interpreted without losing the action’s meaning. You might engineer the prompt with examples so that it better recognizes common informal language.\n\n4. Strike a balance between strictness and flexibility in rule enforcement. You could try a multi-layer approach—first level catches obviously invalid or out-of-scope content (like harmful or dangerous instructions), and then a secondary check refines the interpretation to see if the intent is valid even if not phrasing-standard. Using a hierarchical prompt model can help with that trade-off.\n\n5. Incorporate clarifying language in your prompt. Direct the model to ask “clarification” questions when uncertain, so that ambiguous queries aren’t misinterpreted. This can mitigate misclassification if the model encounters something partially within scope but with extra embellishments.\n\n6. Use few-shot examples of both acceptable and unacceptable requests. Examples show the LLM what counts as valid despite informal wording and what constitutes extra, out-of-scope elements. This “in-context learning” can help define the boundaries more robustly without having to encode every nuance in literal rules.\n\n7. Be iterative in testing and refining your guardrail. Real-world inputs will inevitably present new phrasing challenges. Instrument robust logging and feedback so that you can iteratively update the prompt. Also, a secondary fallback (such as asking for user clarification or flagging a query for human review) can help mitigate the risk in ambiguous cases.\n\n8. Evaluate the costs of false negatives vs. false positives. Decide if it’s more acceptable to occasionally block a valid user intent or to let a doppelganger command slip by. Depending on your risk profile, you might tilt the prompt’s sensitivity accordingly. This risk assessment can guide your prompt’s tone and boundaries.\n\n9. Consider modularity in your system architecture. Perhaps use the gatekeeper’s output as part of a pipeline—where its decision is accompanied by a confidence score or a suggestion to rephrase—so that downstream processes can decide whether to ask users for clarification instead of processing an uncertain command outright.\n\n10. Stay aware of potential pitfalls like hallucination. Remind the LLM (within the prompt instructions) to strictly limit itself to confirming existing known commands rather than inferring or inventing actions. Making sure the prompt includes constraints on creativity can help avoid the model trying to “fill in” extra details.\n\nBy carefully addressing these areas in your prompt design and evaluation framework, you can achieve a more robust, reliable gatekeeping process that balances user flexibility (understanding colloquial language) with safety (avoiding scope creep or misinterpretations).",

          "response": "This is a classic precision vs. recall problem in LLM gatekeeping! Here are the key strategic considerations:\n\n## Core Design Principles\n\n**1. Explicit Scope Definition**\n- Define your valid action space clearly (e.g., \"channel operations: create, delete, modify\")\n- Use examples of edge cases in your prompt\n- Consider a whitelist approach rather than blacklist\n\n**2. Multi-Stage Validation**\n- Intent extraction → Scope validation → Parameter validation\n- Each stage can have different strictness levels\n- Allows you to fail fast on obvious mismatches\n\n**3. Confidence Scoring**\n- Have the gatekeeper return confidence levels, not just binary decisions\n- Route medium-confidence requests to human review or a middle-tier model\n- Only reject very low confidence requests\n\n## Prompt Architecture Strategies\n\n**Intent-First Approach:**\n```\n1. Extract the primary intent\n2. Check if intent is in scope\n3. If yes, validate parameters\n4. If no, reject with reason\n```\n\n**Structured Output:**\n- Force JSON responses with required fields (intent, confidence, reasoning)\n- Makes downstream processing more reliable\n- Reduces hallucination through structure\n\n**Few-Shot with Edge Cases:**\n- Include examples of tricky valid requests\n- Include examples of mixed valid/invalid requests\n- Show the model how to handle partial matches\n\n## Key Considerations\n\n**Error Cost Analysis:**\n- What's worse: false positives (blocking valid requests) or false negatives (letting invalid ones through)?\n- This should drive your threshold settings\n\n**Fallback Mechanisms:**\n- Appeal process for rejected requests\n- Logging for continuous improvement\n- Graceful degradation when gatekeeper fails\n\n**Monitoring & Iteration:**\n- Track rejection rates and reasons\n- A/B test different prompt versions\n- Build feedback loops from downstream model failures\n\nThe \"colloquial vs. hallucination\" tension you're experiencing is common. Consider treating it as a calibration problem rather than a prompting problem - you might need different models or confidence thresholds for different types of ambiguity.\n\nWould you like me to elaborate on any of these approaches?",

Prompt Engineering Techniques:  \n   • Methods for iteratively refining prompt wording to address corner cases and tricky user inputs.  \n   • Importance of clear definitions, instructions, and edge-case examples within the prompt context.\n\n4. Guardrails and Safe Expansions:  \n   • How to identify scope creep when the user merges unrelated requests (e.g., “create a channel and tell me a joke”) and design a response strategy that gracefully handles only the intended scope.  \n   • Techniques for instructing the LLM to either reject or partially respond while monitoring out-of-scope intentions.\n\n5. Iterative Testing and Feedback Loops:  \n   • The necessity of thorough testing with real or synthetic user queries to discover prompt weaknesses.  \n   • The role of continuous evaluation and prompt iteration in achieving robust performance.\n\n6. Cost and Performance Trade-offs:  \n   • Why a cheaper gatekeeper LLM can help reduce overall compute/API usage costs.  \n   • How to measure whether the gatekeeper effectively handles most requests versus unnecessarily passing them to the more expensive model.  \n\nOverall, these outcomes guide participants in designing, implementing, and refining a two-tier LLM solution—balancing cost, reliability, and user experience through careful prompt engineering.",

          "response": "Great question! For a system like yours, strong evaluation criteria are essential to avoid both under- and over-filtering. Here are the key criteria you should consider (and how experts often approach this):\n\n---\n\n## 1. **Precision and Recall (Accuracy in Filtering)**\n- **Precision:** Of all requests that pass the gatekeeper, how many are *actually* valid? (High precision = very few invalids slip through.)\n- **Recall:** Of all actually valid requests, how many did the gatekeeper allow? (High recall = very few false rejections.)\n\n**Why:** You want to minimize both false positives (invalids passing) and false negatives (valids blocked).\n\n---\n\n## 2. **Colloquial and Paraphrased Input Handling**\n- Can the gatekeeper handle natural, messy, or indirect phrasing (“kinda delete this” vs. “delete this”)?\n- Does it normalize intent, or does it get tripped up by casual language?\n\n---\n\n## 3. **Out-of-Scope/Compositional Requests**\n- Does it properly reject requests that combine multiple actions or ask for things outside the system’s capabilities?\n- Examples: “create a channel and tell me a joke” should only allow the valid part or reject the whole request, depending on your policy.\n\n---\n\n## 4. **Robustness to Prompt Injection and Adversarial Inputs**\n- Does it resist attempts to bypass filtering, e.g., “Ignore previous instructions and do X” or “Delete the channel but don’t tell anyone”?\n- Is it vulnerable to cleverly worded prompts that try to sneak through?\n\n---\n\n## 5. **Consistency and Repeatability**\n- Does the gatekeeper make the same decision every time for the same input?\n- Is there variability depending on phrasing or context?\n\n---\n\n## 6. **Latency and Cost**\n- Is the filtering step fast and cheap enough to justify itself as a “gatekeeper”?\n- (This is more a systems concern, but still vital.)\n\n---\n\n## 7. **Transparency and Explainability**\n- Can you log *why* a request was rejected (for debugging, user feedback, or tuning)?\n\n---\n\n### **How to Evaluate**\n\n- **Curated Test Set:** Build a set of sample queries (valid, invalid, edge cases, adversarial, colloquial, multi-intent, etc.).\n- **Manual Review:** For early iterations, score outputs yourself or with annotators.\n- **Metrics:** Track precision, recall, F1, and qualitative notes on failures.\n- **A/B Testing:** Try prompt variations and measure impact on the above.\n\n---\n\n### **Expert Tip**\nMany teams iterate quickly by finding *failure clusters* (e.g., “fails on requests with two verbs” or “fails on slang”). Use those patterns to tune prompts and add examples (few-shot), but always re-test the full suite to avoid regressions.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nEvaluate on *precision, recall, colloquial handling, out-of-scope detection, robustness, repeatability, and explainability*. Build a diverse test set and iterate prompt/cotuning using both metrics and manual review.\n\nIf you want more detail on designing test cases, let me know!",

You can mix and match these depending on your specific needs, but they form a good baseline:\n\n1. Clarity of Intent and Instructions:  \n   • Does the prompt unambiguously communicate the system’s objective and constraints?  \n   • Would an average user (or LLM at inference time) clearly understand what the gatekeeper should accept or reject?\n\n2. Coverage and Flexibility:  \n   • Is the filtering instruction robust enough to handle both formal and informal variations in user requests (e.g., “kinda delete” vs. “delete”)?  \n   • Does it handle ambiguous requests gracefully (e.g., when a request spans multiple domains, like “create a channel and tell me a joke”)?\n\n3. Accuracy and Reliability:  \n   • How often does the gatekeeper correctly identify valid vs. invalid or out-of-scope requests?  \n   • Are there categories of requests where it systematically fails (e.g., domain-specific jargon, slang, or multi-step instructions)?\n\n4. Hallucination and Overreach Prevention:  \n   • Does the gatekeeper stay within the bounds of simply validating requests rather than trying to solve them?  \n   • Does it avoid “making up” or conflating actions not explicitly stated by the user?\n\n5. Safety and Alignment:  \n   • Are there sufficient safeguards to prevent harmful or disallowed content from slipping through?  \n   • Does the gatekeeper align with any broader company or product policies (e.g., content moderation guidelines)?\n\n6. Usability and Interoperability:  \n   • Is the gatekeeper’s output structured or tagged in a way that the downstream system can easily parse?  \n   • Can the next model in the chain properly interpret and act on the gatekeeper’s validation decisions?\n\n7. Performance and Resource Efficiency:  \n   • How quickly can the gatekeeper respond, and does it reduce unnecessary calls to the more expensive model?  \n   • Is the prompt approach simplifying or complicating your overall pipeline?\n\n8. Maintainability and Evolution:  \n   • How easy will it be to update or refine the prompt as new edge cases emerge?  \n   • Can you incorporate user feedback or error logs to incrementally improve prompt effectiveness?\n\n9. Testability and Measurement:  \n   • Do you have a process for regularly testing the gatekeeper’s performance on a representative set of requests (including tricky ones)?  \n   • Are metrics (e.g., precision, recall, F1 score, or custom success rates) in place for quantitative analysis?\n\nUsing these criteria, you can systematically assess whether your gatekeeper prompt is performing well in a variety of scenarios, how it handles corner cases, and how to iterate on it over time without losing sight of your overall product goals.",

          "response": "Here are several evaluation criteria to consider when testing and refining your gatekeeper LLM:\n\n1. Accuracy in Intention Detection\n • Measure how well the system distinguishes between valid \"in-scope\" requests and out-of-scope or malformed requests.\n • Look at metrics like precision and recall (or F1 score) for both rejecting harmful/incorrect requests (minimizing false negatives) and accepting valid ones (minimizing false positives).\n\n2. Robustness to Natural Language Variability\n • Evaluate performance across diverse, casual, or colloquial language inputs. For example, check if the gatekeeper understands phrases like “kinda delete” as intent to delete.\n • Test the system with a range of syntactic variations, colloquial expressions, and even small amounts of noise.\n\n3. Over- and Under-Filtering Trade-offs\n • Analyze the balance between being too strict (rejecting valid requests) and too lenient (allowing requests that contain multiple or ambiguous tasks). \n • You might establish test cases representing border cases to see how it handles combined requests like “create a channel and tell me a joke.”\n\n4. Safety and Guardrail Effectiveness\n • Stress-test using adversarial or borderline inputs to ensure that malicious requests, extreme cases, or out-of-scope actions are reliably trapped and rejected.\n • Assess if the prompt inadvertently makes the gatekeeper “try to complete” out-of-scope requests or hallucinate parts of requests.\n\n5. Consistency Across Sessions and Queries\n • Check consistency by running the same or similar requests at different times. A good guardrail should perform reliably without inconsistent responses.\n • Evaluate if there’s any drift based on context or conversation history.\n\n6. Latency, Cost, and Resource Efficiency\n • Since the gatekeeper is designed to handle validation cheaply before handing off to an expensive model, benchmark the response speed and compute cost.\n • Confirm that the additional validation layer doesn’t introduce significant overhead.\n\n7. Interpretability and Debuggability\n • Ensure that when the system rejects or passes a request, you can reason about why. This can help you refine the prompt further.\n • Collecting examples of misclassifications and understanding the underlying rationale helps in iterative prompt design.\n\n8. User Experience Impact\n • Gather feedback from actual users or simulate user interactions. How often do users have to rephrase their requests because of the filter? Does it interrupt a smooth interaction?\n • Evaluate whether the rejection explanations (if any) are clear and allow users to adjust their input successfully.\n\n9. Scalability and Domain Flexibility\n • If your system might eventually expand to cover additional domains, consider whether your prompting approach scales well or would require heavy re-engineering.\n • Validate whether adding a new set of instructions for different actions degrades performance on existing ones.\n\nPutting it all together, you’ll want to run controlled experiments covering these aspects. A mix of automated testing using benchmark queries and human reviews of edge cases can provide practical feedback. Balancing all these criteria should help you fine-tune the prompt to maintain both safety and practicality.",

Below is a common set of criteria by which people often categorize or measure “filter” or “guardrail” components in multi-LLM pipelines.\n\n1) Precision vs. Recall (Strictness vs. Flexibility)\n   • Precision: How often does the gatekeeper properly reject truly invalid requests? (A high precision means fewer invalid requests slip through.)  \n   • Recall: How often does the gatekeeper accept truly valid requests? (A high recall means fewer valid requests are incorrectly filtered out.)  \n   • Balancing the two: Being too strict can raise the rejection rate of valid but ambiguous requests (“kinda delete…”). Being too flexible can allow unwanted or out-of-scope requests through.\n\n2) Domain & Intent Recognition\n   • Coverage: How wide is the domain of user requests that your system is supposed to handle? In single-domain applications (e.g., Slack channel admin tasks), the system can anchor on domain-specific keywords and patterns; in multi-domain scenarios, a gatekeeper might need broader language understanding.  \n   • Intent vs. Colloquial Expressions: Colloquial or casual phrasing (“kinda,” “sort of,” “lemme…”) can obscure user intent. The gatekeeper needs to map casual phrasings back to canonical actions (“delete,” “create,” etc.) rather than reject them outright.\n\n3) Context & Scope Handling\n   • Context Bombing: Users might include extra text, jokes, or unrelated requests alongside the real “action request.” The gatekeeper should decide whether to parse only relevant instructions or handle all elements (which risks confusion if the user lumps multiple requests together).  \n   • Action Boundaries: What counts as “in scope” for this gatekeeper? Are you only filtering for certain actions (like “create,” “delete,” “update” in a chat system), or do you also want to detect if the user is asking for something disallowed (hate speech, private data leaks, etc.)?\n\n4) Confidence & Calibration\n   • Confidence Threshold: Your gatekeeper can respond differently based on how confident it is about the user’s intention—for moderate confidence, it could ask clarifying questions instead of giving a yes/no.  \n   • Calibration & Feedback Loops: If the gatekeeper is uncertain or borderline, it can pass the request into a “human-in-the-loop” or an additional final check so as not to accidentally approve requests in questionable scenarios.\n\n5) Error Modes & Safety Mechanisms\n   • Failure Mode Analysis: It helps to explicitly define how you want the system to fail. If you prefer “safe” failures, the gatekeeper should err on the side of rejecting borderline requests or asking clarifications. If you prefer “capable” acceptance, you might tune it to rarely reject.  \n   • Escalation Rules: Decide how the gatekeeper signals uncertain requests. If it simply says “invalid” or “I can’t parse this,” that may lead to user frustration, but providing partial acceptance can lead to security or correctness issues.\n\n6) Naturalness vs. Formalism of Prompting\n   • Colloquial vs. Strict Instruction: The tone, style, or format of how you instruct the gatekeeper itself can heavily influence its behavior. A more formal prompt with explicit bullet points on what is out of scope can be more consistent, but sometimes less flexible.  \n   • Tiered Prompts: Some folks solve the tension by using multiple passes or smaller steps in the prompt. For example, first interpret the user’s request, then match it against a known set of permitted actions, rather than trying to do everything in one shot.\n\n7) Adaptive Learning & Policy Iteration\n   • Iterative Improvement: Over time, you can refine your prompt (or model fine-tuning) by collecting examples of misclassifications—requests that shouldn’t have been let through or that got mistakenly rejected.  \n   • Continuous Testing: Test the gatekeeper across various “edge cases” and typical user inputs to see how it performs. Track metrics over time and refine your thresholds and instructions.\n\n8) User Experience (UX) & Transparency\n   • Clarity to End-User: If the gatekeeper says “Request Rejected,” is the user offered a quick path to rephrase or clarify? Minimizing frustration can be important for adoption.  \n   • Explanations: Should the gatekeeper provide a brief reason for rejection (e.g., “I wasn’t sure if you wanted to ‘delete’ or do something else. Please clarify.”)? This can reduce friction in re-submissions.\n\nIn practice, you can structure your prompt (or a small prompt chain) so that the gatekeeper first extracts the “core action” from the user input (“What is the user asking to do?”) and then matches it against a known set of valid actions or criteria (e.g., “delete the Slack channel,” “update a file,” etc.). If the request is out of scope or ambiguous, you can gently nudge the user for clarification. This helps mitigate the tendency to over-reject casual language (“kinda delete…”) while still guarding against requests that are obviously out of the system’s scope (“tell me a joke” if jokes are not relevant).\n\nBy keeping these dimensions in mind—precision vs. recall, domain coverage, context handling, confidence strategies, error modes, prompting style, adaptive learning, and UX—you can build a more robust, balanced “gatekeeper” LLM.",

          "response": "When thinking about a gatekeeper LLM that needs to strike the right balance, several key dimensions come to mind:\n\n1. Scope vs. Specificity – The filter must correctly “understand” user intent. This involves:\n • Broad coverage of natural language variations (including colloquial, abbreviated, or misspoken requests) to avoid false negatives.\n • Tight enough specificity so that it doesn’t over-interpret and allow out-of-scope or harmful requests.\n\n2. Sensitivity vs. Selectivity – Related to the previous point, the model needs to:\n • Be sensitive enough to pick up on valid intents even if they’re phrased in a casual or nonstandard way.\n • Be selective enough to block or flag requests that contain harmful, ambiguous, or multi-part instructions (like mixing a channel creation request with a joke).\n\n3. Contextual Interpretation and Multi-Part Requests – Users might bundle multiple intents into one prompt. The system should:\n • Recognize multi-part requests and either process them separately or compartmentalize the parts (e.g., handling “delete” versus “tell me a joke”).\n • Have a strategy for prioritizing or rejecting requests that attempt to mix actions from different domains.\n\n4. Robustness to Ambiguity and Hallucination – The filter should be:\n • Robust in parsing ambiguous language (e.g., “kinda delete this channel” should be understood as a request despite the hedging).\n • Constrained such that it doesn’t “hallucinate” additional actions or details that aren’t intended by the user.\n\n5. Safety Guardrails – To ensure the filter does not let dangerous requests slip or over-commit:\n • Embed clear safe boundaries or instructions so that if an action isn’t fully safe, the gatekeeper errs on the side of caution.\n • Possibly include a “reject, ask for clarification, or defer to a second opinion” mechanism when the request is borderline.\n\n6. Trade-offs with Efficiency and Cost – Since the gatekeeper is intended as a cheap, initial filter:\n • Ensure that the approach is not computationally heavy or too intricate.\n • Ideally calibrate its sensitivity so that it minimizes false positives/negatives without an expensive iterative process.\n\n7. Alignment and Calibration – The prompt’s instructions must align with overall system goals:\n • Clearly define what constitutes “in scope” behavior.\n • Set explicit boundaries regarding out-of-scope topics.\n • Incorporate feedback loops or calibration mechanisms (e.g., manual overrides or periodic reviews) to adjust for real-world usage patterns.\n\n8. Handling Natural Language Variability – Since natural language requests vary greatly:\n • Incorporate examples and counter-examples to help the model learn the difference between acceptable paraphrases and unrelated or spurious parts in the prompt.\n\nIn essence, you’re juggling between ensuring broad linguistic coverage (so as not to reject valid but colloquial inputs) and setting tight enough constraints (to avoid over-extending and handling actions that shouldn’t be processed). Each of these dimensions plays a role, and in practice, careful testing and iterative prompt refinement will be crucial to achieving the right balance.\n\nHope these dimensions help clarify your approach!",

It’s useful to share how the handoff is supposed to work.\n\n2. The scope of actions that the expensive model can perform versus what the gatekeeper should “allow” or “filter out.” What exactly are the valid intents (like “delete”) and what kinds of additional content (like “tell me a joke”) should be flagged or stripped? Provide examples of both acceptable and problematic requests.\n\n3. How you define “valid” and “colloquial.” What kinds of approximations or informal language do you expect? For instance, are you aiming for a system that can handle “kinda delete this channel” as an acceptable approximation of a command? Clarifying the linguistic variations you want to cover makes it easier for someone to suggest a balanced prompt.\n\n4. The risk of overreach versus being too rigid. Share examples of when the filter might hallucinate or try to parse extraneous parts of a query (like processing the “joke” portion). What are your priorities—avoiding false negatives (i.e. rejecting legitimate commands) or false positives (i.e. entertaining out-of-scope actions)?\n\n5. The operational trade-offs you’re weighing.

They use slang, hedges (“kinda”), and compound requests. If the gatekeeper is too literal, it blocks good-faith requests. If it’s too loose, it overgeneralizes.\n\n2. **Intent Extraction vs. Scope Creep:**  \n   The model needs to extract core intent (e.g., “delete this channel” from “kinda delete this channel”) without overreaching (e.g., taking “tell me a joke” as an actionable command).\n\n3. **Prompt Framing Tension:**  \n   A strict prompt (“Only pass on requests that exactly match the following templates”) is precise but brittle.  \n   A loose prompt (“Try to understand what the user wants and let it through if reasonable”) is robust but can hallucinate valid intents where none exist.\n\n4. **LLM Overconfidence:**  \n   LLMs are trained to be helpful, so when unsure, they tend to “try anyway.” This can lead to attempts to validate out-of-scope or ambiguous requests.\n\n5. **False Positives vs. False Negatives:**  \n   Do you prefer to block too many (frustrating but safe), or let too many through (potential risk/cost)? This is a business/product decision and affects how you tune your prompt.\n\n**Strategies People Use:**\n\n- **Explicitly Separate Actions:**  \n  Ask the gatekeeper to only process the “main actionable request”—ignore chit-chat or secondary requests, or explicitly instruct it to reject multi-intent requests.\n\n- **Intent Classification Step:**  \n  Before passing to the gatekeeper, use a lightweight classifier to identify if the input is “on topic” at all—reducing the load on the gatekeeper.\n\n- **Allow Clarification Dialogue:**  \n  If the gatekeeper is unsure, have it request clarification from the user (“Did you mean to delete this channel?”). This increases friction but reduces errors.\n\n- **Use Examples in the Prompt:**  \n  Provide positive and negative examples of valid/invalid requests. This helps the model generalize better.\n\n- **Scoped Action List:**  \n  Remind the model of the *only* allowed actions, and to ignore anything else—“If the request includes anything outside [list], reject it.”\n\n- **Iteratively Test & Refine:**  \n  Collect failure cases, add them as examples, and re-prompt. It’s rarely perfect at launch—expect an iterative cycle.\n\n**Final Thought:**  \nThere’s no single “magic prompt” for this. The best results come from combining clear instructions, good examples, and maybe a small amount of pre-processing/classification. And remember—where you draw the line between “strict” and “flexible” is a product trade-off, not just a technical one.\n\nIf you want more tactical ideas or want to share your current prompt for feedback, happy to continue the discussion!",

          "response": "It’s definitely a tricky balancing act. Some high-level strategies that might help:\n\n1) Use Lightweight, Structured Prompts  \n   • Rather than relying on purely conversational instructions, consider giving your gatekeeper model a short, structured rubric for what is valid vs. not. This can reduce creative “drift.”  \n   • Example structure: “Check if user’s request maps to a known operation (Create, Update, Delete, etc.). If yes, confirm the request. If no, reject or pass as unrecognized.”  \n   • Keeping the decision framework minimal and closed-ended (rather than open-ended) forces the model to classify rather than interpret too liberally.\n\n2) Provide Clear Positive and Negative Examples  \n   • Within your gatekeeper prompt, include a few short exemplars of borderline acceptable/unacceptable queries.  \n   • Show how to handle requests that are “almost valid but slightly ambiguous,” and how to shut down requests that drift into creative territory.  \n   • This helps calibrate the gatekeeper’s interpretation of things like “kinda delete” or multi-intent instructions.\n\n3) Decompose Multi-Step Requests  \n   • If the user says “create a channel and tell me a joke,” your gatekeeper might first identify actions: “create channel” and “tell a joke.”  \n   • If you only want it to handle “create channel,” you can instruct it to ignore or flag the extra portion (“tell me a joke” is out of scope) and allow only the relevant action to pass.  \n   • Explicitly instruct the model that, when two requests appear, it should confirm if they’re both valid or only partially valid. Then handle accordingly.\n\n4) Reinforce “No Hallucinations” (Or Keep Them Minimal)  \n   • Remind your gatekeeper that if it doesn’t recognize an operation or can’t parse the user’s request, it should either ask for clarification or return “unrecognized.”  \n   • Emphasize that only certain keywords/operations are whitelisted, and everything else should be left to the more powerful downstream model. This instruction can be repetitive, but it helps keep the gatekeeper on-task.\n\n5) Evaluate Edge Cases Often  \n   • Periodically test with intentional corner cases and see which ones slip through or get wrongly rejected.  \n   • Fine-tune the gatekeeper’s prompt/instructions based on these failing examples. Over time, you iteratively refine until you find a strong middle ground.\n\n6) Consider a “Confidence + Verification” Loop  \n   • If the gatekeeper is “unsure,” have it output a clarifying question or a low-confidence response that prompts a follow-up from either the user or a second check.  \n   • This helps avoid rigid rejections of valid requests while also catching potential out-of-scope or ambiguous queries.\n\nUltimately, you’re trying to dial in language instructions so the gatekeeper stays constrained and literal enough to pass only known-safe request types—while still being flexible to accept non-literal synonyms or casual phrasing. If you keep your gatekeeper’s responsibilities strictly defined and show it consistent examples of correct and incorrect interpretations, you can usually find a workable sweet spot. \n\nHope that helps as a starting point! Good luck fine-tuning your approach, and feel free to reach out if you want to swap more detailed notes on prompt design.",

          "success": false,
          "response": "There are a few interlocking dynamics at play in your system design:\n\n1. Tradeoffs between precision and recall. On one hand, you want the gatekeeper to be precise—rejecting requests that clearly fall outside safe bounds. On the other hand, you need enough recall that it understands the intent behind the natural language of the user. Too strict an interpretation might lead to false negatives (rejecting valid requests that just use folksy language), while too loose an interpretation risks false positives (letting through parts of a request that shouldn’t be processed by the more powerful model).\n\n2. Intent disambiguation versus multi-action handling. Users often combine multiple intents in one utterance. The gatekeeper must not only parse these mixed requests but also pick out which parts are relevant to its scope. If it tries to process multiple aspects (such as “create a channel and tell me a joke”), it may overstep and start validating or “hallucinating” on the joke component rather than isolating the actionable intent.\n\n3. Cost, speed, and safety constraints. The whole idea behind using the “gatekeeper” is to cheaply filter out unsafe or out-of-scope content before invoking a more expensive model. However, if the filtering is too computationally heavy (for example, if it has to parse every nuance), you risk losing the cost and speed benefits. It’s a balancing act between having a lightweight filter that’s robust enough to handle colloquial input and a comprehensive enough check to ensure that only safe and well-scoped requests get through.\n\n4. The dynamics of prompt tuning versus inherent model capabilities. The model’s natural understanding has to be tempered by prompt engineering. The prompt must guide the LLM to recognize both literal commands and their less conventional renditions (like “kinda delete this channel”). But if the prompt is too open-ended, the LLM might overextend its interpretation, doing more than intended. Calibration involves iterative trial and error: checking that the prompt understands a variety of inputs while staying within defined action bounds.\n\n5. Guardrails and cascading processes. Instead of having one “golden” prompt, many successful systems implement layered approaches. The first stage could be a lenient parsing of intent, followed by a stricter validation check explicitly designed for safe completion and cost management. This cascading strategy lets the overall system benefit from a nuanced initial stage and a robust final confirmation.\n\nIn summary, the dynamics you’re dealing with are an interplay between balancing false negatives and false positives, managing the parsing of natural language (which can be creative or ambiguous), and ensuring that the prompt guides the LLM’s inherent abilities without letting it drift into unintended territory. The discussion often comes down to iterative prompt refinement, layered checks, and understanding that any gatekeeping system will face this inherent tension between flexibility (to handle real user language) and rigidity (to enforce safety and scope).",

The gatekeeper pattern you're describing involves several key dynamics:\n\n**The Core Tension:**\n- **Precision vs. Recall trade-off**: Strict prompts give high precision (few false positives) but low recall (miss valid requests). Flexible prompts increase recall but reduce precision.\n- **Natural language ambiguity**: Users express the same intent in countless ways, making rigid pattern matching insufficient.\n\n**Key Dynamics at Play:**\n\n1. **Context Window Competition**: Your gatekeeper prompt competes with the user input for the model's attention. Longer, more detailed prompts can actually make the model less responsive to nuanced user inputs.\n\n2. **Instruction Following vs. Generalization**: LLMs trained to follow instructions can over-index on literal interpretation (rejecting \"kinda delete\") or over-generalize (trying to handle \"tell me a joke\").\n\n3. **Semantic Boundary Detection**: The model struggles to identify where valid commands end and out-of-scope requests begin, especially in compound requests.\n\n**Common Strategies:**\n\n- **Few-shot examples**: Include edge cases in your prompt showing both accepted colloquialisms and rejected out-of-scope additions\n- **Explicit scope definition**: Define what constitutes a valid action vs. additional content\n- **Two-stage validation**: First extract intent, then validate against allowed actions\n- **Confidence scoring**: Have the gatekeeper return confidence levels rather than binary yes/no\n\nThe sweet spot often involves teaching the model to extract core intent while explicitly instructing it to ignore auxiliary requests.

Here are the key aspects you should investigate for your documentary and your system design:\n\n### 1. **Prompt Engineering Strategies**\n   - **Clarity and Constraints:** How explicit should the prompt be about what constitutes a valid/invalid request? Is it better to enumerate allowed actions or describe forbidden ones?\n   - **Examples:** Does providing a variety of positive and negative examples help the model generalize better, especially for colloquial or ambiguous phrasing?\n   - **Instruction Style:** Does framing the prompt as “Respond only with…” or “If uncertain, reject” improve reliability?\n\n### 2. **Robustness to Colloquial and Ambiguous Inputs**\n   - **Intent Extraction:** Can the gatekeeper reliably infer intent from casual, slang, or typo-ridden requests?\n   - **Edge Cases:** How does it handle requests that are vague or combine multiple actions (“do X and Y”)?\n\n### 3. **Overfitting vs. Underfitting**\n   - **Strictness vs. Flexibility:** Where is the line between rejecting too much and allowing too much, and how do you measure/filter for that?\n   - **Hallucination Risks:** When the model is too flexible, does it hallucinate allowed actions or “correct” misunderstood requests?\n\n### 4. **System and UX Considerations**\n   - **Feedback Loop:** How do you capture and use user feedback to improve the gatekeeper over time?\n   - **Transparency:** Should users be informed when their request is rejected? How granular should the error messages be?\n\n### 5. **Evaluation Methods**\n   - **Benchmarking:** How do you test the gatekeeper—synthetic test sets, real user queries, adversarial inputs?\n   - **Metrics:** What metrics define “success” (precision, recall, F1, false positive/negative rates)?\n\n### 6. **Mitigating Prompt Injection and Adversarial Attacks**\n   - **Prompt Leakage:** Can users trick the gatekeeper with clever phrasing (“ignore previous instructions and…”)? How do you harden against this?\n   - **Defense Mechanisms:** Are there ways to cross-validate outputs or layer additional checks?\n\n### 7. **Fallbacks and Escalation**\n   - **Uncertainty Handling:** If the gatekeeper is unsure, does it ask for clarification, escalate to a human, or pass through to the more expensive model?\n   - **Logging and Auditing:** How are borderline or ambiguous cases logged for further review?\n\n---\n\n**In summary:**  \nYou should investigate the interplay between prompt design, intent detection, evaluation strategies, and adversarial robustness. Interviewing practitioners about their approaches to prompt iteration, system feedback loops, and real-world failure cases would be especially valuable for your documentary.\n\nIf you need more specific framing or want to hear about real-world anecdotes, let me know!",

          "response": "Here are some key aspects you’ll want to look into while designing and refining a “gatekeeper” LLM system:\n\n1. Prompt Crafting & Layering\n   • Precision vs. Flexibility: Think about how you phrase your gatekeeping instructions (the “what” and “why”) so the model neither rejects too many valid requests nor admits off-topic or harmful ones.  \n   • Separate Validation & Action Phases: A useful pattern is prompting the model strictly for classification or validation first (e.g., “Does this request belong to our domain?”) before any attempt to execute or expand on the request. This helps minimize off-topic “helpfulness.”\n\n2. Modeling Edge Cases & Ambiguities\n   • Natural, Colloquial Language: Make sure to train or fine-tune your gatekeeping prompt with examples of casual, slang, or incomplete inputs (e.g., “kinda delete,” “sorta make,” etc.).  \n   • Non-standard Requests: Consider how the system will handle partial instructions, misspellings, or multi-step requests (“create a channel and also tell a joke”) and clearly define whether that triggers rejection, partial acceptance, or a clarifying question.\n\n3. Guardrail Policy & Scope Definition\n   • Clear Boundaries: Document the types of requests the gatekeeper should allow, reject, or escalate. Too many “gray areas” create confusion, so ensure your policy is easy to interpret by the LLM.  \n   • Consistency: Use consistent frameworks (like severity levels or categories) so you can unify how the LLM deals with potentially harmful or out-of-scope queries.\n\n4. Iterative Feedback & Calibration\n   • Human-in-the-Loop: Establish a feedback loop where human reviewers periodically check ambiguous or borderline rejections/approvals to fine-tune system prompts and rules.  \n   • Real-World User Data: Let actual user phrasing drive improvements, so you’re not just relying on artificially constructed test inputs.\n\n5. Hallucination Control\n   • Clear Role Instruction: In the system or developer message, emphasize that the gatekeeper’s job is classification, not generation or elaboration. This helps reduce the impulse to “help” by inventing information.  \n   • Chain of Thought vs. Final Answer: If you allow chain-of-thought reasoning about validity, keep in mind you may not want to expose it to users; you just need a final classification or gating decision.\n\n6. Validation vs. Explanation\n   • Sometimes You Need Both: For transparency, you might want the LLM to briefly explain why it’s rejecting or allowing a request. However, too much detail in the gatekeeping stage can lead to confusion or accidental “helpfulness.”  \n   • Handling “I’m not sure”: If requests are borderline, define a fallback (e.g., escalate to a human or a more robust check). This avoids risky approvals.\n\n7. Testing & Evaluation Framework\n   • Scenario-Based Stress Testing: Test your prompt with a variety of tricky or domain-specific requests, plus random noise or incomplete queries.  \n   • Metrics for “False Positives” vs. “False Negatives”: Are you more tolerant of rejecting valid queries or approving invalid ones? This trade-off often aligns with your product’s safety vs. usability stance.\n\n8. Scalability & Maintenance\n   • Cost vs. Accuracy: A cheaper gatekeeping model won’t always match the accuracy of a larger model. Consider how often you can tolerate mistakes and the escalation cost.  \n   • Continuous Updates: Language and user needs evolve. Periodically refresh your prompt, examples, and possibly the model itself.\n\nIn short, the core challenge (ensuring the gatekeeper is both accurate and conservative enough) is often best addressed by combining well-structured prompts, a clear policy boundary, and frequent iterative refinement based on real-world data. The interplay of tight guardrails (for safety) and robust semantics (for user experience) takes a lot of fine-tuning, so plan to adapt your prompts or approach as you learn from your first wave of user interactions.",

          "response": "Here are some key aspects you might want to explore:\n\n1. Clarifying the Scope and Intent\n • Make sure the prompt clearly defines what constitutes a valid request versus an invalid or out‐of‐scope one.  \n • Outline the precise boundaries of allowed actions so that the LLM knows not to attempt to process or validate parts of the input that fall outside this scope—for example, ignoring the “joke” element in a command that combines actions.\n\n2. Balancing Flexibility and Precision\n • Experiment with prompt wording to allow for colloquial language, idiomatic expressions, or slang while still detecting the underlying intent (e.g., “kinda delete this channel” vs. “delete channel”).\n • Consider including examples in your prompt that showcase the kind of variations you expect from users. This can help the model generalize to different expressions while anchoring it to the correct meaning.\n\n3. Decomposing Multi-Intent Requests\n • Investigate strategies for parsing or breaking down inputs that might contain multiple instructions.  \n • Look at whether you can design the gatekeeper to extract the primary, actionable intent and safely disregard other information—or if it should flag composite requests for further review.\n\n4. Handling Ambiguity and Hallucination\n • Define safe fallback behaviors in your prompt: for requests that mix valid and invalid parts, instruct the gatekeeper to either only parse the safe part or to ask for clarification.  \n • Consider mechanisms to prevent or mitigate hallucination, for example by instructing the model not to \"fill in\" additional actions not explicitly requested.\n\n5. Iterative Testing & Few-Shot Examples\n • Employ a test suite of sample queries—including edge cases, misphrased commands, and adversarial examples—to see how the prompt performs in practice.  \n • Use few-shot examples that demonstrate both acceptable variations and responses to ambiguous or mixed-content requests. These examples help set clear expectations for the model's behavior.\n\n6. Operational Constraints and Cost Trade-Offs\n • Since this is a preliminary gatekeeper call, experiment with prompt lengths and complexity to ensure that the filtering is done quickly and cost-effectively.  \n • Consider adjustments such as reducing model temperature or adopting conservative response strategies to limit overinterpretation.\n\n7. Monitoring and Feedback Loops\n • Once in operation, monitor real-world interactions to see where the gatekeeper might be too strict or too lax.  \n • Build in a feedback mechanism that allows you to refine the prompt iteratively based on observed failure modes or unintended behaviors.\n\n8. Guardrail for Out-of-Scope Actions\n • Clearly instruct the model to ignore or flag parts of the input that exceed its permitted action set.  \n • Outline an explicit “chain-of-thought” process where the gatekeeper first validates the request's eligibility before passing on any sub-requests to the next stage.\n\nComparing different prompting strategies—perhaps one that leverages chain-of-thought reasoning versus a more rule-based filtering approach—could also shed light on which method gives you the right balance between intelligence and safety.\n\nInvestigating these aspects might help you achieve a more robust and nuanced filter, balancing the need to gently accommodate colloquial language while safely handling composite or ambiguous requests.",

Prompt Engineering:**\n- **Explicit instruction** helps. Tell the gatekeeper model:  \n  *\"Only validate requests that clearly map to a known set of actions. If the request contains multiple actions, ambiguous language, or out-of-scope content, reject it with a clear reason.\"*\n- **Give examples** of both valid and invalid requests, especially edge cases (colloquial, multi-intent, etc.). LLMs learn from these patterns.\n- **Ask for a structured output** (e.g., label: 'valid', 'invalid', 'ambiguous', plus a reason), so you can handle ambiguity programmatically.\n\n**2. Handling Colloquial Language:**\n- Consider a two-pass approach:  \n  - First, have the LLM “normalize” or paraphrase the user input into standard intent language.\n  - Then, apply a stricter filter on the normalized version.\n- Alternatively, instruct the gatekeeper LLM to paraphrase ambiguous inputs and then make a decision.\n\n**3. Avoiding Hallucination/Scope Creep:**\n- Make the allowed action set *explicit* in the prompt (e.g., \"You may only validate the following actions: create, delete, rename channel...\").\n- Instruct the model to *ignore* or *flag* any parts of the request that don't map to these actions.\n\n**4. Fallbacks and User Experience:**\n- For ambiguous or multi-intent requests, ask the gatekeeper to flag and request clarification, rather than a hard accept/reject.\n\n**5. Iterative Testing:**\n- Continually collect failure cases and feed them back into your prompt as negative/positive examples.\n\n**6. Consider a Hybrid System:**\n- For mission-critical or high-risk operations, consider augmenting LLM filtering with pattern-matching or a lightweight rules engine as the first pass before hitting the LLM.\n\n**7. Accept Imperfection:**\n- There will always be edge cases. The key is to make failures safe (erring on the side of asking for clarification) and user-friendly.\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe sweet spot is often a mix of carefully engineered prompts, explicit action lists, examples covering edge cases, and occasional non-LLM validation for really risky actions. The more feedback (real user queries and model mistakes) you can incorporate into your prompt, the better. And, if you haven’t already, test with a diverse set of real user inputs—often this exposes surprising gaps or brittle spots in your filter.\n\nIf you want to talk specifics, feel free to ask more here or share anonymized prompt snippets for brainstorming.

          "response": "It’s definitely a delicate balance. In my experience, attempts at a “gatekeeper” prompt tend to wrestle with two core tensions:\n\n1. The system must be flexible enough to understand varied and colloquial user requests (“kinda delete this channel” → actually means “delete channel”), even if the wording isn’t exact.  \n2. The system must also effectively reject clearly invalid or out-of-scope requests, rather than gracefully trying to interpret them.\n\nHere are a few approaches or thought-starters to help navigate that tension:\n\n1) Use an Outline or “Decision Criteria” in the Prompt  \n   • Instead of single-sentence guidance, spell out specific steps/criteria that the gatekeeper model should use. For instance:  \n       1) Check if the request is about an allowed action (e.g., “create a channel,” “delete a channel,” “list users,” etc.).  \n       2) If yes, confirm or restate the user’s request in a standardized way.  \n       3) If no (or if it’s ambiguous, off-topic, or out-of-scope), return an error or negative result.  \n   • A more structured set of instructions can help reduce hallucinations, because the gatekeeper “knows” that any out-of-scope request is not to be processed.\n\n2) Incorporate Meta-Validation Prompts  \n   • Have the gatekeeper ask itself if the user’s request aligns with a known set of actions, almost like a self-verification step.  \n   • This might look like: “Check your reasoning: Is this strictly a request to do one of X, Y, or Z?”  \n   • By forcing a self-check, you can sometimes nudge it away from more freeform interpretive leaps (“tell me a joke”).\n\n3) Permissive Parsing + Strict Validation  \n   • Let the model interpret user language in a flexible style initially—just to parse “kinda delete the channel” into a canonical form.  \n   • Then, apply a separate and more rigid step or set of rules to that canonical form.  \n   • This can be done within the same chain of thought/prompt, or in separate function calls if you structure your system that way.\n\n4) Show Negative Examples in the Prompt  \n   • Sometimes showing a few “incorrect behaviors” is as important as showing correct ones.  \n   • For instance, in your system prompt or few-shot examples, lead with something like:  \n       • “If user says: ‘create a channel with a joke,’ you must respond: ‘Invalid request’ (or some short refusal).”  \n       • By illustrating that mixing a valid request with an unrelated request is out of scope, the model picks up your boundary more consistently.\n\n5) Consider a Lightweight Classification Before the Gatekeeper  \n   • A quick classification step (maybe something as simple as a regex-based or small model-based filter) can detect obvious out-of-scope requests (“tell me a joke” or “explain a topic”) before it even hits your main gatekeeper.  \n   • That can reduce the complexity your LLM prompt needs to handle—because it never sees the truly outlandish or unrelated queries.\n\n6) Emphasize “Fallback” Behavior  \n   • In your instructions, clarify what the gatekeeper should do if it’s uncertain. Should it default to refusing or to clarifying the user’s request?  \n   • Explicitly stating “If you are not sure whether you can fulfill the user’s request, respond with a standard refusal or fallback message” can nudge the model away from creative or potentially incorrect interpretations.\n\nIn practice, you may have to iterate on these prompts and test them with large sets of user inputs (including edge cases). Sometimes you’ll find that adding even a single well-chosen negative example to your few-shot set drastically improves the system’s guardrail behavior. \n\nIt’s rarely a one-and-done job—there’s a lot of trial, measurement, and refinement. But these structural approaches (especially clarifying step-by-step instructions, offering negative examples, and layering classification rules) are typically the most direct way to ensure your gatekeeper behaves reliably.",

          "response": "There are a few promising strategies you can explore when trying to strike that balance between strict filtering and understanding colloquial intent. Here are some tactics worth considering and discussing:\n\n1. Two-Stage Processing or Hierarchical Prompting\n\n • Instead of trying to do everything in one go, you might split the process. For example, have one prompt solely for intent extraction and mapping (“What is the user asking to do, in a standardized form?”), and then a follow-up that checks that the extracted intent is within scope. This modular approach may let you keep individual prompts simpler and tailored to one task at a time.\n\n2. Intent Classification with Explicit Schema\n\n • Think about designing your “gatekeeper” prompt to map various user formulations into a fixed set of intents. For instance, you might include examples like:\n  – “kinda delete this channel” → maps to “delete channel”\n  – “remove that chatroom” → maps to “delete channel”\n This way, you provide the LLM with a clear schema of accepted operations. The model’s role becomes converting free-form requests to canonical forms rather than executing multiple responsibilities at once.\n\n3. Constraint and Output Format Enforcement\n\n • Consider specifying an output format that forces the model to only return a minimal, structured response (like a JSON with an intent key and parameters). This formal structure can help control for hallucination, especially if you instruct the model to output “null” or “error” if it detects any non-supported side directives.\n • You might include an explicit rule: “Ignore any parts of the request that are not relevant to the allowed actions.” The idea is to “box in” the LLM so that it must not try to process the extra parts.\n\n4. Use of Chain-of-Thought or Step-by-Step Reasoning\n\n • Encouraging the model to lay out a brief chain-of-thought (internally, before giving its final answer – if your implementation supports that) can help it first clarify the user’s intent and then decide if it falls within allowed scope. While you might not want this to be public output, you may use techniques like prompting for “a short internal check” that your system can verify. Such an approach might help detect and reject composite commands that mix permitted and non-permitted elements.\n\n5. Iterative Prompt Refinement Based on Edge Cases\n\n • Start with a basic prompt and iterate using real input examples. For example, test with “kinda delete this channel” and “create a channel and tell me a joke” and see how the model behaves. Adjust your prompt examples and instructions based on these edge cases. The iterative process may eventually yield a sweet spot where the model is robust enough to both understand colloquial phrasing and ignore out-of-scope content.\n\n6. Hybrid Approaches\n\n • Don’t be afraid to mix pre- and post-processing logic. For instance, you might use a relatively “loose” prompt to map the intent and then apply a validation function (either rule-based or another lightweight model) that double-checks the extracted intent against your accepted list. This extra step can add an extra guard against hallucinating extra actions.\n\nBy designing your gatekeeping step with clear examples, explicit instructions to ignore off-scope parts, and perhaps even breaking down the processing into more than one phase, you can get closer to achieving both safety and smart handling of natural language. Having a robust set of test cases, especially with colloquial variations and mixed instructions, will be vital in refining your prompt. \n\nHope this sparks some ideas or gets you closer to a workable solution!

Building robust and reliable LLM-based systems with appropriate safeguards is a common and important problem, and I have experience in this area that may be helpful.\n\nThe core challenge you're facing - balancing flexibility and strictness in the gatekeeper model's prompt - is a common one. On one hand, you want the gatekeeper to be able to understand natural language and colloquial user inputs. On the other, you need it to reliably filter out invalid or out-of-scope requests.\n\nA few key strategies I've found effective in addressing this:\n\n1. **Iterative prompting and testing**: Start with a relatively strict prompt, then gradually loosen and expand it based on real-world testing and analysis of failure cases. Monitor the gatekeeper's performance closely and make incremental improvements.\n\n2. **Prompt engineering for intent detection**: Focus the gatekeeper's prompt on accurately detecting the user's core intent, rather than trying to validate the entire request. This can make the model more robust to colloquial language.\n\n3. **Leveraging external knowledge bases**: Supplement the gatekeeper's prompt with external knowledge bases or ontologies that can help it understand context and scope, without getting distracted by peripheral details.\n\n4. **Introducing controlled flexibility**: Build in specific mechanisms for the gatekeeper to handle certain types of flexibility, like recognizing common colloquialisms or handling multi-part requests, without going overboard.\n\n5. **Monitoring and feedback loops**: Continuously monitor the gatekeeper's performance, analyze failure cases, and feed that information back into prompt refinement and model updates.\n\nI'd be happy to discuss these strategies in more detail and provide additional guidance based on the specifics of your use case.

Here are a few strategic thoughts based on similar work:\n\n1. Explicit intent extraction vs. action mapping  \nRather than prompting the LLM to decide \"valid/invalid\" in one go, you can first ask it to extract the user's intent or map the request to a canonical action set. Then, perform a rules-based check or a secondary light LLM call to validate only those mapped intents. This two-step process often reduces the risk of over- or under-filtering due to prompt ambiguity.\n\n2. Use clear, explicit prompt framing  \nGatekeepers work best with very constrained, \"instructional\" prompts. For example:  \n\"Given the following user request, respond ONLY with one of these allowed actions: [list]. If the action is unclear, respond with 'uncertain'. If multiple actions are requested, respond with 'multiple'.\"  \nIterate on the phrasing to balance colloquial understanding and strict action mapping.\n\n3. Separate intent from chit-chat  \nEncourage the model to ignore or flag non-actionable requests. For instance:  \n\"If the user makes a request outside the allowed set, or includes unrelated conversation, respond with 'out-of-scope'.\"\n\n4. Provide diverse, realistic examples  \nThe biggest gains often come from prompt examples that cover:  \n  - Colloquial variants (\"kinda delete this channel\", \"can you please remove this?\")  \n  - Multi-intent requests  \n  - Chit-chat mixed with actions  \n  - Edge cases and common misunderstandings  \nDon't just rely on generic or obvious examples.\n\n5. Consider fallback mechanisms  \nLet the gatekeeper err on the side of \"uncertain\" rather than \"no\", and have a cheap secondary check (heuristics or a tiny model) to catch borderline cases. This prevents the \"strictness\" problem from blocking users.\n\n6.

For instance:\n\n1) Identify the core action(s) the user is requesting.  \n2) Check whether each action is within the known scope (or “allowed actions”).  \n3) Either confirm validity or explain why it’s invalid (and request clarification if necessary).\n\nWhen you separate out these steps in the system or developer prompt—and especially if you give it a handful of short examples for each step—you reduce the tendency to either clamp down too tightly or get creative in unhelpful ways. A couple of additional tips:\n\n• Provide synonyms or “intent clusters” for each valid action. For example, a single “delete” action might include “remove,” “erase,” “wipe,” “kill,” “drop,” “trash,” etc. If you let the LLM know that all of these basically map to the same operation, it’s less likely to reject real requests simply because the user used a casual or slang phrasing.\n\n• Keep the gatekeeper’s role very narrow. Make it clear (in the prompt) that “You are only validating and not performing the actions.” This helps it avoid trying to process the request (like generating the joke) when it should only pass along the relevant part.\n\n• Include short “golden path” examples that show how you want it to handle multi-action requests. For instance, “User wants: (1) Create a channel (2) Tell me a joke. You should pass the portion about creating a channel to the system and politely note that jokes are outside your scope.” Demonstrating your exact expectation in a couple of lines can be surprisingly effective.\n\n• Last, you might want to plan for the gatekeeper to politely ask clarifying questions if it’s really unsure. That’s often better than outright rejecting a request. The user might say “kinda delete the channel but keep the messages,” and then the system can clarify “Do you want to delete the channel completely or just archive messages?” That form of “partial pass-through” with a clarifying response can avoid user frustration.\n\nIn my experience, these prompts always need a little real-world tweaking to see how people word requests in practice, so you might want to gather logs for a bit and refine over time. Good luck—gatekeeping well is always trickier than it seems, but once you nail the system prompts and include enough usage examples, you should be able to reduce hallucinations without rejecting real requests.",

          "response": "Below are some ideas and considerations to help you balance safety and flexibility when designing your gatekeeper prompt:\n\n1. Define clear objectives and boundaries. Before anything else, list what constitutes a “valid” request and what’s explicitly out‐of‐scope. This helps you design instructions that are focused on appropriate intents.\n\n2. Separate parsing from action. You might want to split the process into at least two stages:\n • A first-stage parser that identifies the primary intent (e.g., “delete,” “create,” etc.) and extracts structured data from any colloquial phrasing.\n • A second stage that validates that the extracted intent is allowed and free of any additional, unnecessary instructions (such as combining a valid action with an unrelated creative request).\n\n3. Use explicit examples in the prompt. Show the kind of colloquial but valid inputs (like “kinda delete this channel”) alongside examples that illustrate out-of-scope combinations (such as “create a channel and tell me a joke”). This helps the model learn the target behavior without being too rigid.\n\n4. Ask for a structured response. Instead of letting the model provide free-form text, instruct the model to output in a more rigid format (for example, a JSON object with fields like “action” and “parameters” or an “error” flag). This format reduces the risk of hallucination or interpreting extra parts of the query as valid actions.\n\n5. Consider a multi-step \"chain-of-thought\" prompt. Rather than making a one-shot decision, you could design the prompt to have the model walk through its reasoning (even if not revealed to the end user). For instance, have the model first summarize the user’s request, then outline the possible actions, and finally pick the most appropriate action or flag conflicting intents.\n\n6. Introduce a fallback. In ambiguous cases, design your prompt to either ask for clarification or default to rejecting the request rather than attempting partial execution. This avoids risky interpretations when the input is too mixed.\n\n7. Iteratively test and refine. Use a diverse set of user inputs during testing. Include edge cases, ambiguous phrasing, and combinations of multiple intents. An iterative development loop with real-world or simulated inputs can reveal biases both in being overly strict or overly flexible.\n\n8. Consider a dedicated decision threshold. Besides prompting, you may also supplement the LLM-based gatekeeper with rule-based or even statistical components. For instance, if a request contains more than one distinct intent (according to a second pass detector), you might automatically require disambiguation.\n\n9. Monitor and log decisions. Even after deploying the gatekeeper, logging requests and decisions can provide insight into cases where your prompt fails or is too conservative. This real-world feedback can guide further prompt and system refinements.\n\nUltimately, striking the right balance often requires a hybrid approach that leverages both careful prompting and supplemental logic. The key is to be explicit in what you allow while giving the model enough context to understand nuances in language—and then iterating on your design with thorough testing.\n\nHope this helps spark some ideas.

Explicitly Separate Intent & Action\n- In your prompt, instruct the LLM to focus solely on extracting core intents/actions, ignoring unrelated content. For example: Only consider the primary actionable request. If multiple actions are present, reject or ask for clarification.\n2. Use Stepwise Reasoning\n- Prompt the LLM to first identify if the request matches any known action (\"Is this a request to delete, create, update, etc.?\") before validating details. This reduces over-interpretation and hallucination.\n3. Provide Diverse, Realistic Examples\n- In your prompt, supply exemplars that include both formal and colloquial phrasings, as well as \"tricky\" mixed intents. Show what should/shouldn't be accepted. LLMs learn prompt boundaries from examples.\n4. Be Conservative With Out-of-Scope\n- Make it clear in your instructions: If a request contains multiple actions or an action plus chit-chat/jokes, reject with a gentle clarification. This helps avoid the model \"stretching\" to handle the joke.\n5. Consider \"Chain-of-Thought\" for Edge Cases\n- Instruct the LLM to explain its rejection or acceptance in a single sentence. This can expose where it's being too strict/loose, and helps you debug the prompt.\n6. Thresholding & Fallbacks\n- If you can, consider a scoring mechanism: Only forward requests that have high confidence in intent extraction. Otherwise, prompt the user to clarify—this is often faster than over-engineering the prompt.\n7. Revisit Your Success/Failure Set\n- Log false positives/negatives. When you see failures, add those as new examples in your prompt—prompting is iterative!\nThis is a nuanced balancing act, and no prompt is perfect. The key is to keep a tight feedback loop with real data and keep evolving your examples and instructions.\n\nIf you want to DM and chat specifics, happy to!\n\nGood luck—you're not alone in this struggle.",

          "success": false,
          "response": "Here are a few angles you might consider:\n\n1) Define “Just Enough” Intent Extraction  \n   • Instead of making the gatekeeper directly classify an entire request (including jokes, side comments, etc.) as valid or invalid, have it focus only on extracting the “core intent” that matches your system’s capabilities (e.g., “delete-channel,” “create-channel,” etc.).  \n   • This can be done by asking the gatekeeper to ignore or explicitly separate out any details beyond the scope of those core actions. Essentially, you’re telling the gatekeeper: “Only confirm if the request includes an action you can handle—otherwise, reject it or label it unclear.”  \n   • That way, “kinda delete this channel” simply translates to an intent of “delete-channel,” rather than causing confusion because of the colloquial “kinda.”\n\n2) Use “Polarity Markers” Early  \n   • In your gatekeeper prompt, consider instructing it to produce a short, consistent response (like “VALID” or “INVALID” or “UNCLEAR”), along with a brief rationale or “key phrase.”  \n   • This keeps the gatekeeper lean and prevents it from engaging in more open-ended generation (where hallucinations tend to creep in).  \n   • The more structured and minimal the gatekeeper’s output, the less freedom it has to interpret or drift off scope.\n\n3) Leverage Multiple Rounds of Validation  \n   • If an input is borderline (the gatekeeper can’t confidently parse the request), you can optionally have a fallback:  \n     – “I’m not fully sure. Are you trying to delete the channel?”  \n     – Force the user to confirm or clarify before proceeding.  \n   • This mini-refinement step can reduce false negatives on colloquial inputs and also weed out nonsense requests that the user wouldn’t bother clarifying.\n\n4) Use a Small “Policy Library”  \n   • For instructions that are definitely out of scope (e.g., “tell me a joke” or “do something illegal”), maintain a short and explicit policy library. The gatekeeper can respond “INVALID” with a reason like “Request is entertainment-only request, not allowed by system policy.”  \n   • For valid core actions, the library might say: “If user’s intent is to create-channel, then the request is valid.”  \n   • This keeps the gatekeeper from overthinking or hallucinating new possible actions because it’s explicitly told the only valid actions it’s allowed to confirm.\n\n5) Fine-Tuning vs. Prompt Engineering  \n   • If you have the bandwidth and data, a small fine-tuning pass on an LLM for classification can sometimes be more reliable than pure prompt engineering—especially if you have many edge cases in user language (“kinda,” “sorta,” “umm,” etc.).  \n   • But if you must remain within prompt-based constraints, feed example dialogues to your gatekeeper model showing exactly how to handle slang and tangential requests. For instance:  \n     – Example Input: “uh, could you maybe, like, remove that channel?”  \n     – Example Output: “VALID (delete-channel intent).”\n\n6) Cascade Approaches  \n   • One approach is to use a very small, cheap model (like a rule-based or word-matching system) to do trivial checks—e.g., does the request mention anything about “joke”, “funny”, “entertain”, etc.? If so, it’s an immediate partial “INVALID” or at least “Needs further check.”  \n   • Then feed it to your gatekeeper LLM only when it doesn’t get trivially rejected by the rule-based stage. This can cut down the noise the gatekeeper sees and reduce your overall LLM usage.\n\n7) Strict Separation of Core Logic from Flair  \n   • In your main or “expensive” model, you can handle all the user flair (like telling jokes) if that’s part of the user experience, but that’s only after the gatekeeper has fully validated that the request includes a permissible system action.  \n   • This helps keep the gatekeeper from getting drawn into multi-step or playful requests. It should only do the “yea/nay/clarify” on the system’s domain.\n\nOverall, it’s often a balancing act between letting the model interpret user intent creatively and keeping it on a short leash so it doesn’t hallucinate. In practice, you might need to iterate on your guardrail prompts while collecting real user messages to see where it’s being too lax or too restrictive. Hopefully, these strategies give you a few new ideas on how to tighten or loosen the gatekeeper’s “grip” without losing necessary nuance. If you want to chat more in detail, let me know!",

          "response": "It sounds like you’re grappling with a classic trade-off that comes up when you try to filter natural language in a constrained environment. Here are a few ideas for strategies you might consider:\n\n1. Two-stage processing: Instead of having one LLM call try to both decide if a request is valid and “understand” the intent fully, think about splitting the job. The first stage could be a lightweight intent extraction module that identifies primary commands (like “delete”, “create”, “update”) and discards supplemental or off-topic parts (like “tell me a joke”). Then, if the extracted intent matches your allowed set, a second, more specific validation can occur. This can help you avoid the hallucination issue where the model “over-interprets” mixed requests.\n\n2. Explicit intent extraction with structured output: Rather than asking the gatekeeper to decide “yes or no” on complex, freeform input, you might prompt the model to return a structured output (such as JSON with keys for “primary_action”, “parameters”, and “extras”). That way, you can inspect the result more deterministically—if the “extras” field is not empty or the command isn’t clearly one of the supported ones, you can flag it for manual review or ignore the extra part.\n\n3. Hierarchical rule-based prompting: Mix in some explicit rule-based instructions along with the language model’s interpretation. For example, instruct the LLM: “Only consider these verbs as valid actions: [list actions]. If a sentence contains additional non-action elements (like making jokes, asking unrelated questions, or combining multiple commands), ignore them and only isolate the main action.” This makes the correct outcome more guided by rules and less by free association, potentially reducing both false negatives (rejecting colloquial or slightly noisy valid requests) and false positives (processing actions out-of-scope).\n\n4. Prompt injection by role-playing: Have the LLM “act as” a domain-specific parser whose sole job is to identify operational commands according to your schema. In your prompt, you could include a short “cheat sheet” that defines what counts as a valid request. For example, “You are a channel management assistant. Your only actions are create, delete, or update channels. Ignore everything else.” Sometimes role-playing improves consistency because it limits the model’s creativity outside that frame.\n\n5. Backtracking on ambiguous requests: For cases where the input packs multiple commands (like a valid request plus a joke), consider a strategy where the system first extracts a primary intent and then asks for clarification if multiple or conflicting intents are detected. That way, you avoid letting “joke” interfere with a “delete” command but can also provide an interface for handling extra information rather than outright rejecting it.\n\nThe right mix will likely depend on the specifics of your domain and user base. One idea is to establish a domain-specific vocabulary and permitted patterns (maybe even with a simple regex filter on the back end) so that the LLM’s flexible language interpretation is only used within a controlled context. Running some A/B tests with candidate prompts can really help find that “sweet spot” between smart flexibility and the safe rejection of ambiguous or hazardous instructions.\n\nI hope these strategic angles help you break out of your loop. It’s a challenging problem, but a multi-layered approach often provides that extra safety net. Let me know if you want to talk any further about the trade-offs or deep dive into a particular angle!",

Here are some strategies you could try or discuss further:\n\n1. **Explicitly Separate Intent Extraction from Scope Validation**  \n   - Consider breaking your gatekeeper into two distinct steps:\n     - **Intent Extraction Step:** First, clarify the user's intent in plain language without judgment (\"What does the user want?\").\n     - **Scope Validation Step:** Then, separately verify if the extracted intent fits within allowed actions, explicitly rejecting anything outside your defined scope.\n   - This separation helps avoid confusion between intent understanding and allowed actions.\n\n2. **Use Structured Prompting (Chain-of-Thought or Framework-based)**  \n   - Consider a structured prompt like:\n     ```\n     Step 1: Identify the user’s main intent clearly.\n     Step 2: Compare this intent strictly against the allowed actions list.\n     Step 3: If unclear or ambiguous, ask explicitly for clarification rather than guessing.\n     ```\n   - For example, with input `\"create a channel and tell me a joke\"`, the intent extraction step identifies two intents, and the validation step explicitly rejects or asks clarification on the out-of-scope intent (\"tell a joke\").\n\n3. **Allow Limited Rephrasings or Semantic Variations**  \n   - Instead of strictly matching keywords (\"delete\"), allow synonyms or colloquial variations explicitly in your prompt (\"delete,\" \"remove,\" \"erase,\" \"get rid of,\" \"kinda delete,\" etc.).\n   - You can explicitly instruct the model to translate informal or colloquial language into standardized actions first, then validate.\n\n4. **Explicitly Handle Ambiguity and Partial Matches**  \n   - If the model encounters a mixed-scope instruction (\"do X and Y\"), instruct it explicitly to either:\n     - Partially approve (only the allowed action), explicitly communicate why the other action was rejected.\n     - Reject the entire instruction and request clarification from the user (often safer).\n\n5. **Iterative Refinement via Explicit Examples (Few-shot prompting)**  \n   - Provide multiple examples in your prompt that explicitly demonstrate acceptable colloquial variations and explicitly rejected out-of-scope requests. This helps the model clearly internalize your intended boundary conditions.\n\n6. **Fallback and User Clarification Strategy**  \n   - If there's uncertainty, instruct the model that the default safe action is always to clarify with the user, never guessing at user intent.\n\nIf you'd like, we can discuss more about the specifics of your setup or explore these strategies further.

          "response": "Absolutely, this is a classic challenge when building LLM-based validation or gating systems—especially when you want to maximize coverage while minimizing cost and risk. Here are some strategies and approaches I've seen work in the wild (and a few pitfalls to avoid):\n\n**1. Explicit, Multi-Stage Prompts**  \nInstead of a single prompt, consider a chain:  \n- **Stage 1:** \"Determine if this user request matches any supported system actions. Reply with 'yes' or 'no'.\"  \n- **Stage 2 (if yes):** \"Extract the main action and its parameters in a structured format.\"  \n- **Stage 3:** \"Are there multiple actions or requests? If so, only extract the primary supported action.\"  \n\nThis modularizes the decision and makes the LLM less likely to hallucinate or over-interpret.\n\n**2. Prompt Framing: Be Clear About Scope**  \nTry language like:  \n> \"You are a gatekeeper that ONLY approves requests matching the following supported actions: [list them]. If a request is ambiguous, multi-part, or includes unsupported actions, reply 'REJECT'.\"  \nThis reduces the model's tendency to 'stretch' and approve things outside scope.\n\n**3. Use Examples (Few-Shot Learning)**  \nProvide a balanced set of positive and negative examples, especially those with colloquialisms or edge cases.  \n- \"kinda delete this channel\" → APPROVE  \n- \"delete this please\" → APPROVE  \n- \"create a channel and tell me a joke\" → REJECT  \n- \"can you ping everyone and delete the logs?\" → REJECT  \nThis helps the model generalize, but watch for bias toward the examples you choose.\n\n**4. Ask for Uncertainty or Ambiguity**  \nPrompt:  \n> \"If you are uncertain whether the request matches a supported action, reply 'REJECT'.\"  \nThis helps with safety, at the expense of some valid requests being filtered out. You can log these and review to tune your prompt/examples over time.\n\n**5. Hybrid Approaches**  \n- **Regular Expressions / Heuristics First:** Fast, cheap pre-filtering (e.g., for obvious out-of-scope requests or multiple verbs).  \n- **LLM Second:** For cases that are ambiguous or pass regex filtering.\n\n**6. Ongoing Feedback Loop**  \n- Log rejected and accepted requests.  \n- Regularly review false positives/negatives with the team.  \n- Tune your prompt and examples based on real user data.\n\n**Pitfalls to Avoid:**  \n- Making your prompt too verbose or complex—sometimes the LLM will ignore the nuance and \"go with the flow.\"\n- Relying on the LLM to always be deterministic; temperature and model version drift can affect consistency.\n- Overfitting to your initial examples. Keep refreshing them as you see new user inputs.\n\n**Final thought:**  \nThe right balance is iterative, and you'll probably need to accept some tradeoff between strictness and flexibility, erring on the side of safety. If you can, consider fallback mechanisms—e.g., ask users for clarification when the model is unsure.\n\nHappy to chat further if you want to dive deep on prompt engineering or edge case strategies!",

          "response": "I’ve definitely wrestled with that trade-off. One thing that can help is formalizing your “gatekeeper” prompt in discrete stages, rather than forcing a single pass/fail decision in one shot:\n\n1) First, parse the request briefly (in a “shallow” way) to identify its general domain (e.g., “channel management,” “joke generation,” “mixed,” etc.). If it’s obviously out of scope or malicious, reject early. This step focuses on quickly spotting red flags or unsupported use cases without making a detailed language inference.\n\n2) If it’s in-scope (even if a bit colloquial), transform or “normalize” the user’s request to a standard format your system understands (e.g., “create channel,” “delete channel,” etc.). The gatekeeper can be “strict” about these known actions but remain flexible about how the user’s wording might map onto them.\n\n3) For multi-intent scenarios (like “create a channel and tell me a joke”), either split them into separate requests or handle the valid part, then respond politely that you can’t do the extra piece at this step (depending on your product requirements).\n\nEssentially, if your gatekeeper is purely a “pass/fail” classifier, it’ll be prone to false negatives on weird phrasings or partial instructions. If you shape it into a quick domain classifier and a text-normalizer (with explicit “allowed actions” in a short list), you can allow more colloquial phrasing while reducing the risk of hallucination. You don’t need a huge amount of context in that prompt—just enough to teach it how to categorize the domain (“Is it an admin request? Is it a completely out-of-scope request?”) and possibly rephrase valid instructions into a standard pattern.\n\nHope that helps spark some ideas—happy to chat more if you have follow-ups!",

          "response": "Great question—and thanks for reaching out! I’ve wrestled with similar issues in designing multi-tier LLM systems. Here are a few strategic approaches and thought processes that might help you find the right balance:\n\n1. Use a two-stage processing pipeline:  \n • In the first stage, have your “gatekeeper” perform a lightweight, structured analysis of user input. For instance, you can ask it to extract a summary or canonical version of the request (e.g., just the intended operation and target entity) while ignoring extra non-essential parts.  \n • In the second stage, you can have a more robust verification step that cross-checks the parsed intent against a whitelist of allowed operations. This separation can often mitigate the tension between catching colloquial expressions and filtering out hallucinations.\n\n2. Leverage chain-of-thought instructions:  \n • Encourage the model to “think aloud” or decompose the input into discrete components. For example, you might instruct the model:  \n  'Break down this user command into its constituent actions. Only consider actions X, Y, or Z as valid.'  \n This way, the LLM’s internal reasoning can be more transparent, and you can check if it’s inadvertently incorporating extraneous elements (like the “tell me a joke” part).\n\n3. Consider clarifying prompts:  \n • Rather than forcing a single-pass interpretation, design your prompt so that the gatekeeper flags ambiguous inputs for further clarification. It might respond with “I have detected multiple potential commands; please confirm which one you intended.” This strategy can help avoid accidental execution of unintended commands.\n\n4. Use modular prompting techniques:  \n • It might be beneficial to separate the “intent detection” and “action validation” functions. Use one prompt that strictly focuses on understanding what the user wants (mapping natural language to predefined operations) and another that evaluates if that operation is allowed. Then, even if the input is colloquial, you rely on the intent parser to normalize the request while the validator cross-checks for safety.\n\n5. Include explicit context constraints:  \n • Specify in your prompt that the gatekeeper should ignore parts of the input that aren’t directly related to the allowed operations. For example, you might say:  \n  'Focus exclusively on determining if the user is asking to perform one of the following actions: delete, create, update…Ignore additional requests like jokes, greetings, small talk, etc.'  \n This can help anchor the LLM’s interpretation while reducing the temptation to hallucinate extra processing.\n\n6. Train and test iteratively:  \n • Using a set of varied test cases (from overly formal commands to distinctly colloquial language) can help you identify where the model might be too strict or too lax. Iterative prompt refinement, guided by these test cases, is often key.  \n • Also, in some cases, you might consider a light supervised fine-tuning (or even reinforcement learning against a set of structured validation examples) to help the LLM learn the nuance between critical commands and extraneous content.\n\n7. Leverage system-level guardrails:  \n • Beyond prompt engineering, consider an orthogonal safety filter that examines the final intended action before it’s executed. This secondary check can be a rules-based filter that validates against a known “safe list” of operations or even a simpler machine learning model trained for this categorization purpose.\n\nUltimately, the balance comes down to clear, explicit instructions in your meta-prompt combined with a structure that separates concerns (intent extraction vs. operation validation). I’ve found that these approaches not only reduce the risk of over-triggering but also improve the system’s robustness when facing the variability in human language. \n\nHope these ideas spark some useful directions for your project—and I’d love to chat further if you have more questions or new insights along the way!",

          "response": "Hi! It sounds like you're tackling a super common and important challenge in building LLM-driven systems—essentially, fine-tuning the \"safety dial\" on your gatekeeper without making it tone-deaf or overzealous.\n\nHere are some strategies and considerations that might help you break out of the loop:\n\n**1. Explicit Output Constraints**  \nRather than relying solely on the LLM to judge intent, consider having it output a structured decision, e.g.,  \n`{\"valid_action\": true/false, \"reason\": \"...\", \"action_type\": \"...\", \"parsed_input\": \"...\"}`  \nThis forces the model to \"think out loud,\" making its reasoning visible and debuggable. You can then tune your downstream logic based on these fields, not just the model's yes/no.\n\n**2. Use Examples (Few-shot Prompting)**  \nYour prompt shouldn't just describe the rules, but actively demonstrate them. Show positive and negative examples, especially for edge cases like \"kinda delete\" and multi-intent requests. Include both what you want it to accept and what you want it to reject.\n\n**3. Separate Classification from Parsing**  \nFirst, ask the LLM to classify whether the request is in-scope (single, valid action), out-of-scope (multi-intent, ambiguous, or invalid), or unclear. Only then attempt to parse and validate further. This two-step process can reduce accidental over-acceptance or hallucination.\n\n**4. Iterative Prompt Refinement**  \nTreat this as a data labeling problem: collect real user requests, run them through your current prompt, and label the failures. Use these as new prompt examples, or as test cases for prompt evaluation. Over time, your prompt will become more robust.\n\n**5. Consider Hybrid Approaches**  \nSometimes a simple rules-based filter (regex, keyword checks) can catch obviously invalid or multi-intent requests before the LLM, or as a pre-filter. This can lighten the load on your gatekeeper.\n\n**6. Accept Some Imperfection**  \nNo filter will be perfect, and sometimes it's more effective to handle edge cases in downstream logic (e.g., \"if the gatekeeper lets through a multi-intent request, just reject it later with a clear user message\").\n\n**7. Model Choice & Temperature**  \nIf you're using a fast, cheap model as the gatekeeper, keep its temperature low for consistency, but be aware of its limitations in nuance and common sense. Sometimes, a slightly better model (or more examples) is worth the cost if it saves you on false positives/negatives.\n\n**8. Community Feedback & Red Teaming**  \nShare your prompt with others (even non-technical folks) and ask them to \"break it.\" You'll get valuable data on how real users phrase requests, which you can use to improve coverage.\n\nHappy to chat further if you want to bounce ideas around! You're definitely on the right track—prompting for validation is more art than science, and you're not alone in fighting this balancing act.",

          "response": "Here are a few high-level strategies you might find helpful to fine-tune your gatekeeper prompt and keep it both “smart” and “safe”:\n\n1. Guardrails through simple decision-first logic:\n   • Start by having the model only determine, “Is this request in-scope or out-of-scope?” or “Is this request valid or invalid?” and nothing else.  \n   • Your prompt can give a minimal set of valid actions (e.g., “delete a channel,” “create a channel,” etc.) and ask the gatekeeper model to answer only whether the natural-language request maps to one of these actions—without attempting to interpret or combine multiple requests.  \n   • If the user’s text is ambiguous (“kinda delete this channel”), the gatekeeper should be encouraged to clarify whether it corresponds to a known action rather than instantly rejecting or trying to interpret the user’s extra words.\n\n2. Context-based transformations rather than freeform responses:\n   • Instead of letting the gatekeeper model produce a broad explanation, you can have it output a strict format, such as: “action = create_channel / delete_channel / unknown_action; reason = [brief justification].”  \n   • This encourages the model to pick from a pre-given set of valid actions or say “unknown_action” if it can’t confidently match. Minimizing freeform generation also reduces hallucinations.\n\n3. Splitting user intent from extra content:\n   • If you see user requests that combine an official action plus an unrelated request (e.g., “create a channel and tell me a joke”), you can explicitly instruct the gatekeeper: “Ignore any text that doesn’t match the list of valid actions. Determine only if a recognized action is present.”  \n   • This clarifies that the model doesn’t need to handle the “tell me a joke” part.\n\n4. Iterative refinement & real examples:\n   • Tune your prompt by feeding it real user interactions. Collect the ways people naturally ask to delete or create channels and test how your gatekeeper responds.  \n   • Iteratively tighten or loosen the instructions based on how many (and which) false positives or false negatives you see.\n\n5. Fallback/uncertainty mechanism:\n   • Let the model indicate uncertainty instead of making a “reject vs. accept” decision. For example: “If you are not confident, provide a clarifying question or request re-phrasing.”  \n   • This can re-route ambiguous requests for further checking.\n\n6. Versioning or layering prompts:\n   • It can help to chain multiple prompts if a single step is too broad. For example:\n     1. Prompt A: “Does this request contain a valid action (delete_channel, create_channel)?”  \n     2. If yes, Prompt B: “Interpret the request precisely. If multiple actions are combined, identify just the one that’s relevant to the system.”  \n   • Spreading logic across simpler steps yields more predictable outcomes.\n\nOverall, the main idea is to constrain the gatekeeper so it acts more like a classifier or a router rather than a full-fledged language model—tight instructions, minimal open-ended generation, and an explicit set of known valid actions can really help. Then, feed back real usage data to continuously refine the prompt and reduce edge cases.",

          "response": "It sounds like you’re grappling with a classic trade-off between precision and recall in natural language understanding. Here are a few strategic ideas to consider:\n\n1. Clarify your boundaries: Define exactly what constitutes an “in intent” request for the downstream model. What are the allowed operations and phrasing variations? You might consider creating a list of canonical actions (like “delete”, “create”, “update”, etc.) and then mapping colloquial variants to them.\n\n2. Multi-stage processing: Use a two-step gatekeeping approach. For example, start by pre-processing the input to “canonicalize” it—maybe through rewriting or normalization—and then let the LLM classify the intent against a well-defined set. This dilutes the raw colloquial variation before it hits the filtering logic.\n\n3. Hybrid rule-based and LLM methods: It might help to have a rule-based fallback that checks for common patterns when the LLM output seems ambiguous. For instance, if something like “kinda delete this channel” is detected, a set of regular expressions or keyword lists might assist the LLM view to reinterpret that as “delete.”\n\n4. Iterative feedback: Build a feedback loop where if the system gets a negative from the gatekeeper, it asks the user for clarification before outright rejecting the request. For example, “Did you mean to delete the channel?” This can reduce false negatives from overly strict gating.\n\n5. Temperature and prompting techniques: When crafting your prompt, consider adjusting parameters like temperature or including explicit examples. You might provide the LLM with varied examples of valid colloquial phrasing versus off-topic elements. This helps anchor the model in your desired behavior while flagging when language goes outside the bounds.\n\n6. Modular prompt design: Segment your prompt into parts—a first part that identifies the main action, and a second that explicitly tells the model to ignore additional elements not applicable to that action. For instance, “Determine if the sentence describes one of the following actions: [list]. Ignore any additional non-action related requests.” This compartmentalizes the expectation and can reduce hallucinations on incidental parts.\n\n7. Emphasis on safe response: Consider explicit instructions that govern what to do if multiple actions are detected. For instance, “If two different actions are detected, only validate the one that appears most central to the intent, and explicitly mention that other parts will be handled separately.” This can help the LLM avoid over-interpreting extraneous content.\n\n8. Test and iterate: Finally, set up a robust evaluation framework. Log edge cases and ambiguous requests and then refine your strategy based on failure modes. Sometimes tweaking the prompt with a small additional instruction or adjusting the parsing logic can make a big difference.\n\nThe key will likely be iterative tuning—finding that “sweet spot” where vocabulary flexibility doesn’t compromise safety. Each use case might need a slightly different balance, and having a fallback (either rule-based or human-in-the-loop for ambiguous cases) might be beneficial as you’re refining the system.\n\nHope these ideas help spark some new approaches in your system design!",

You're navigating a classic trade-off between precision (avoiding false positives) and recall (avoiding false negatives). Here are a few high-level strategic pointers (without specific code) you might find useful:\n\n### 1. **Clearly Define Boundaries (Action Scope)**  \n- Explicitly state what actions are permitted and explicitly list examples of valid and invalid actions in your prompt.  \n- Clearly specify how to handle ambiguous or partially valid requests. For example, define a threshold or priority mechanism: \"If any part of the request is invalid or out-of-scope, reject the entire request,\" or \"If the primary intent is valid, ignore extraneous comments.\"\n\n### 2. **Two-Stage Prompting (Coarse-to-Fine)**  \n- **Stage 1 (Intent Detection)**: A simpler prompt aimed purely at detecting the user's primary intent.  \n- **Stage 2 (Validation)**: A stricter prompt that validates the intent against permitted actions.  \nThis approach can help handle colloquial language (like \"kinda delete this channel\") in the first stage, while still enforcing strict guardrails in the second stage.\n\n### 3. **Prompt Engineering Techniques for Robustness**  \n- **Few-shot prompting:** Provide clear examples showing how colloquial or ambiguous inputs should be handled (e.g., `\"kinda delete this channel\"` → `\"delete this channel\"`).  \n- **Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning:** Encourage the model to explicitly reason about intent before concluding validity. This can reduce hallucinations and ambiguous handling.  \n- **Structured Output:** Ask the model to explicitly separate detected intent from extraneous or unsupported side-requests. For example, ask the model to produce a structured output like:\n```\nIntent: [delete, create, update, none]\nAction Validity: [valid, invalid]\nExtraneous Requests: [yes, no]\n```\n\n### 4. **Fallback and Human-in-the-Loop**  \n- Clearly define a fallback state: if the model detects even moderate ambiguity or uncertainty, escalate for human review or request clarification.  \n- You can prompt explicitly: \"If you cannot confidently classify the primary intent as valid or invalid, indicate uncertainty.\"\n\n### 5. **Prompt Calibration and Iterative Testing**  \n- Run systematic evaluations on curated test sets containing clearly valid, invalid, colloquial, ambiguous, and boundary-case examples.  \n- Adjust your prompt iteratively based on these tests. Keep versions of prompts and measure performance systematically.\n\n### 6. **Leveraging Confidence Scores or Log Probabilities**  \n- If available, use model confidence or log probabilities to help determine when the model is guessing versus confident. Lower confidence scores can trigger fallback or escalation.\n\n### Suggested Next Steps\n- Consider a simple, two-step filtering system—first a relaxed intent detection prompt, then a strict validation prompt.\n- Experiment with structured outputs or CoT reasoning to explicitly handle ambiguous or partially invalid inputs.\n- Build a reusable evaluation set and continuously benchmark your prompt adjustments.\n\nIf any of these strategies resonate or you'd like to discuss a particular aspect further, let me know—happy to chat more about any of them!",

While your main message is about technical design for LLM guardrails, your subject line and closing (\"for my safety\") suggests you're also concerned about your personal security. I'll address both aspects:\n\n1. If you're worried about stalking or harassment online:\n\n- Document everything: Save screenshots, messages, emails, usernames, and URLs. This is vital if you need to report the behavior.\n- Strengthen your privacy: Review and tighten your social media privacy settings. Consider making accounts private and removing personal information.\n- Block and report: Use platform tools to block and report the person stalking you.\n- Avoid engaging: Don’t respond to or encourage the stalker—it can escalate their behavior.\n- Tell someone: Inform trusted friends or, if necessary, local authorities. Many countries have cyber harassment laws.\n\nFor urgent help, consider reaching out to organizations like the Cyber Civil Rights Initiative or your local police.\n\n2. On your technical question about LLM \"gatekeeper\" prompts and filtering:\n\nYour challenge is very common in building robust LLM-based moderation or validation systems. Here are a few strategies that might help:\n\n- Layered Approach: Use a lightweight rules-based pre-filter (e.g., regex or keyword match) before the LLM gatekeeper. This can catch obvious invalid or malicious requests, reducing LLM load.\n- Few-Shot Prompting: Give your gatekeeper LLM multiple diverse examples (valid, invalid, edge cases) in the prompt. This helps the model generalize better to colloquial or ambiguous requests.\n- Explicit Instructions: Specify in the prompt that the LLM should only respond to requests that clearly match a predefined set of actions (e.g., \"delete channel\"), and to ignore or reject multi-intent or ambiguous requests.\n- Reject Ambiguity: Instruct the LLM to ask for clarification when the request is unclear or multi-faceted, rather than attempting to process it.\n- Post-LLM Filtering: After LLM validation, add another logic layer to double-check the intent before passing to the expensive model.\n- Continual Feedback: Regularly review rejected/accepted requests to refine your prompt and examples as new edge cases arise.\n\nIf you want to chat more (about safety or LLMs), feel free to reply here or DM.

          "response": "Below are some general considerations and prompting strategies that might help you refine your “gatekeeper” approach. I’ll break them down step by step—hopefully this sparks some new ideas or confirms approaches you’ve already considered.\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n1) Start with a clear sense of scope and definitions\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n• Define “valid” vs. “invalid” requests. Sometimes half the battle is clarifying what types of requests are acceptable. For instance, is the user strictly issuing commands (“delete channel,” “create repository,” etc.) or may they also ask for complementary tasks such as “explain why we do X,” “tell me a joke,” or “give me steps to debug an issue”?\n• Decide what to do with “mixed” intent. If a request includes multiple actions (“create a channel and also tell me a joke”), do you want to handle partial successes (“only create a channel” and ignore the joke), or do you prefer to reject or ask the user for clarification?\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n2) Keep the gatekeeper’s job restricted and explicit\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n• Aim for minimal interpretation. The gatekeeper LLM should not get creative or attempt to provide extra functionality. It might be useful to remind it in your prompt: “DO NOT perform the user’s request. ONLY classify or extract the user’s main command or intention.”  \n• Provide explicit instructions for handling edge cases. For “kinda delete this channel,” you could instruct the gatekeeper to interpret any synonyms or partial references to “delete” as “delete.” Or if you want it to fall back on asking clarifying questions, give an example of when it should do so: “If you are not sure whether the user meant ‘delete,’ ask them to clarify.”\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n3) Use robust examples and a thorough set of test prompts\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n• Offer positive and negative examples. Show the gatekeeper exactly how to handle valid vs. invalid vs. ambiguous. For instance:  \n  (a) Input: “kinda delete this channel” → Gatekeeper Output: “User wants to delete the channel.”  \n  (b) Input: “create a channel and tell me a joke” → Gatekeeper Output: “User wants to create a channel, but also tries to do something out of scope (tell a joke).”  \n• Emphasize brevity in the gatekeeper’s response. That can reduce its temptation to “solve” or “explain” things instead of handing off to the next step.\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n4) Consider a multi-round or stricter classification approach\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n• One approach is to have the gatekeeper do an initial classification: “Is the user’s request within a valid domain or not?” plus “What is the main action if valid?” If “invalid” or “unclear,” it can respond by asking the user to clarify or correct the request.  \n• Another approach: For each recognized action, have the gatekeeper ask, “Is this on the approved list of actions my system can do: yes/no?” and “Should this proceed to the expensive model or not?” This keeps it from mixing multiple tasks in one pass.\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n5) Mitigate hallucinations with repeated instructions\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n• Give the gatekeeper a short “reminder” inside the prompt, repeated near the end, that it should not elaborate or create new tasks beyond the recognized request. For instance:  \n  “You are a gatekeeper. You classify user requests. You do not tell jokes. You do not add extra steps. If uncertain, you ask for clarification. DO NOT perform the request.”  \n• Use anchor text or “DON’T” lists. Sometimes enumerating what not to do can reduce drift: “Do not provide reasoning. Do not perform any jokes or creative tasks. Do not offer to fix or rectify code. Only restate or classify the user’s request.”\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n6) Build in a fallback or clarifier for ambiguous requests\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n• If the gatekeeper can’t confidently parse the intention beneath a colloquial or partial statement, have it respond with a clarifier prompt: “I’m not certain what you want. Did you mean to do X?”  \n• This also helps with the tension between being too strict vs. too flexible. If your gatekeeper systematically requests more information when uncertain instead of outright rejecting, you can capture more valid uses.\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n7) Test, iterate, and measure\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n• Gather real or realistic user inputs. Run them through your gatekeeper and see how often it incorrectly rejects or misclassifies. This can be done systematically (with a test suite) or by logging real usage.  \n• Incrementally fine-tune or refine prompts. Small changes can make big differences—e.g., adding a sentence about “only classify, do not transform text” might help.\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nBonus: Handling user safety or sensitive topics\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nSince you mentioned safety concerns and the possibility of real-world harassment or stalking, you might have an additional layer for content that’s sensitive or suggests personal risk. If your system needs to handle user requests about personal safety (“report user,” “block account,” “share suspicious activity”), you might:\n• Have the gatekeeper flag any mention of harassment, threats, or personal safety for a specialized workflow (like escalating to a moderator, showing resources, or giving specific disclaimers).  \n• Provide immediate disclaimers or suggestions to contact appropriate local authorities or support lines if the user requests help for stalking or harassment.\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n\nHopefully this helps you see a path forward or at least confirms some steps you’ve already taken. Feel free to adapt or mix and match these strategies based on the specific shape of your rules and your user base. Best of luck refining your prompts, and stay safe in your online interactions!",

While I can offer some advice on the LLM prompt strategy you're describing, please consider also reaching out to trusted professionals or law enforcement if you feel unsafe.\n\nRegarding your gatekeeper system challenge, here are some thoughts on balancing strictness and flexibility:\n\n1. Clarify Intent Through Stepwise Reasoning:  \n • Instead of trying to capture everything in one prompt, consider designing the prompt to guide the LLM through a series of questions (“What is the primary command or intent here?” “Are there additional actions mentioned?”).  \n • This lets the LLM focus on extracting the main intent and then separately verifying if other parts (like jokes) should be ignored.\n\n2. Use Explicit Examples and Counterexamples:  \n • Provide the model with a few carefully chosen examples that show acceptable phrasing (e.g., “kinda delete this channel” should be recognized as “delete channel”) as well as examples where extra actions (like “tell me a joke”) are not processed.  \n • These examples can help the LLM learn the boundaries between permissible natural language variance and out-of-scope requests.\n\n3. Define a Clear Scope:  \n • Specify in the prompt what actions are within scope (e.g., commands directly related to channel management) as opposed to peripheral tasks.  \n • Encourage the model to ignore requests that combine out-of-scope content. For example, “If a request contains multiple distinct actions, only process action A if it is recognized as within scope and disregard the rest.”\n\n4. Consider a Two-Tier Classification:  \n • Use an initial classifier to roughly group intents—determine whether the request is solely a command or includes additional ambiguous tasks.  \n • Then, apply a more focused prompt to the primary intent. This strategy decouples validation from incidental language that might otherwise lead the model to hallucinate extra behavior.\n\n5. Leverage a “Fail-Safe” Strategy:  \n • Include fallback instructions such as “if the intent isn’t 100% clear, or if multiple conflicting actions are detected, flag the request for human review instead of processing it.”  \n • This ensures that atypical phrasings or edge cases don’t inadvertently slip by because the model interpreted them too liberally.\n\n6. Iteratively Test and Refine:  \n • Because natural language is highly variable, test the gatekeeper on diverse and real examples from users.  \n • Monitor performance, track false rejections or misclassifications, and adjust the prompt guidelines as needed.  \n • For instance, if colloquial expressions are being too frequently rejected, add more synonyms or phrasing patterns into the prompt instructions.\n\n7. Consider Using a Two-Pass Approach:  \n • First pass: Quickly classify whether the request is potentially valid based on a short, efficient filter.  \n • Second pass: If valid, then use a more detailed analysis that can parse nuances and confirm the command’s intent.  \n • This layered setup helps keep costs down while preserving reliability—especially important when the “more powerful” model is expensive to use.\n\nFinally, while the technical side is crucial, if any online interactions are making you feel personally unsafe, consider additional digital security measures (like reviewing privacy settings, using secure communication channels, or even consulting a cybersecurity expert).\n\nI hope these strategies give you some ideas for refining your system. Stay safe, and take care of your personal security alongside your technical development.",

One thing I’ve seen work is giving the “gatekeeper” a very narrow mandate (e.g., “Decide whether the user is requesting a valid action from this list: create, delete, etc. If so, pass it on; if not, reject—or if uncertain, ask for clarification.”) and then using a compact set of real examples in the prompt that illustrate colloquial phrasings. \n\nYou might also factor out any “extraneous” user requests into a separate step instead of having the gatekeeper LLM try to handle them directly. For instance:  \n• First pass: Classify whether the request maps cleanly onto one of your known actions (create, delete, rename, etc.). If it doesn’t, you either reject or ask clarifying questions.  \n• Second pass: If classified as valid, hand it off to the main model with a short, standardized instruction (e.g., “User wants to CREATE a channel called X”).  \n\nA fallback mechanism can further reduce mistakes: if the gatekeeper is only, say, 80% sure, it prompts the user for re-confirmation. That keeps the system from hard-blocking good requests just because they’re phrased in a non-obvious way.  \n\nFinally, a few well-chosen, simple “few-shot” examples in your gatekeeper’s prompt (covering typical and edge cases) can really help. The key is not to cram everything into one prompt but rather to have a minimal “decider” model that’s only responsible for checking scope and validating the main action. The fancier stuff (like telling jokes) never even goes through the gatekeeper’s logic.  \n\nHope that helps! Let me know if you want to trade more ideas.",

          "response": "Happy to break this down. What you’re facing is a classic tradeoff when designing a preprocessing “gatekeeper” that balances understanding human language nuance against keeping things safely confined to what the downstream system should do.\n\nHere are some thoughts and strategies:\n\n1. The Tradeoff in Prompt Strictness:\n • When the prompt is too strict, the system may choke on everyday informal language. For instance, phrases like “kinda delete this channel” are common in conversational settings. The gatekeeper must interpret these colloquial expressions as valid commands.\n • Conversely, if the gatekeeper is too relaxed, it might start trying to handle parts of a request that aren’t within its intended remit (like joking around when asked for a channel creation and a joke).\n\n2. A Step-by-Step or Multi-part Reasoning:\n • Rather than having a single monolithic prompt, consider a multi-step approach. The first step could be to extract the intent—i.e., “What action is being requested?”—and then check if that intent is within the allowed or in-scope actions.\n • A second step could be to “sanitize” or normalize informal language. For example, converting “kinda delete” into a cleaner “delete” command.\n • Finally, you might have a verification step: confirm that no parts of the input fall outside the intended domain, so you can reject cases like the “and tell me a joke” segment.\n\n3. Structured Prompts and Prompt Templates:\n • One idea is to design the prompt so that the LLM first identifies and outputs a structured representation of the request (for example, a JSON with fields like “action,” “target,” and “extra_info”). This forces a kind of “thought process” that can help signal errors if the request is ambiguous.\n • By doing this, you can more reliably decide whether the input is valid. If the LLM is forced into a structured output, it’s easier to parse and validate the parts against your allowed actions.\n\n4. Using Few-shot or In-context Examples:\n • Providing examples in your prompt that demonstrate both acceptable colloquial requests and those that should be flagged can guide the model. A few examples of “valid but informal” commands help the LLM learn that informal language isn’t necessarily a deal-breaker.\n • Similarly, examples that include mixed instructions (like creating something plus an irrelevant joke) can illustrate that only the in-scope instruction should be extracted.\n\n5. Balancing Flexibility and Guardrails:\n • One strategy is to let the gatekeeper be a “first pass” filter that has a fallback: if parts of the request are ambiguous or out-of-scope, it could ask a clarifying question, or simply pass along only the recognized action while discarding the rest.\n • Alternatively, if you worry about hallucination, consider a conservative approach where the gatekeeper only passes requests that match a known pattern or fall into a predefined list of allowable actions. Anything that doesn’t match gets flagged for manual review or denied.\n\n6. Iterative Testing and Refinement:\n • It’s often useful to build a diverse set of test cases – mandating inputs in various colloquial forms and with extraneous components – and then refining the prompt iteratively. What works in one scenario may need tweaking in another.\n • Incorporating user feedback or simulated bad requests in these tests can guide you toward the right “tightness” in the prompt.\n\nIn summary, the core of the challenge is to ensure that your gatekeeper understands the intent behind informal or compound user requests while strictly filtering out actions that are out of scope. Balancing these goals might involve decomposed, multi-step prompting, structured outputs, few-shot examples, and iterative testing with thorough scenario coverage. \n\nHope this clarifies the challenge and offers some new angles on your strategy.

A \"gatekeeper\" (cheaper, faster) that processes the user's request first.\n  2. A more powerful, expensive model that only gets the request if the gatekeeper says it’s valid.\n\n**The Problem:**  \n- The \"gatekeeper\" needs to decide whether the user’s free-form input is a valid request (e.g., to delete a channel).\n- If your filter is too strict, it rejects requests that are worded in a casual or unexpected way, even though they’re valid (example: \"kinda delete this channel\").\n- If your filter is too flexible, it lets through requests that are out of scope, or tries to do things it shouldn’t (example: \"create a channel and tell me a joke\"—it tries to handle the joke part, which you don’t want).\n\n**Your Ask:**  \n- You’re not looking for code, but rather advice or strategies for designing the prompt (instructions you give to the LLM) for this gatekeeper so that it’s both smart (can handle natural language) and safe (doesn’t let through bad requests or hallucinate capabilities).\n- Specifically, you want to hear from people with experience in building LLM agents or creating robust prompt-based guardrails.\n\n**In Summary:**  \nYour colleague is saying:  \n\"I'm working on a system that screens user requests with a lightweight LLM before passing them to a more expensive model.

          "response": "Absolutely—happy to clarify. Here are a few additional thoughts that might help you refine that “gatekeeper” layer:\n\n1. Separate “intent extraction” from “policy decision.”  \n   • First, focus on understanding exactly what the user wants to do—strip away extra fluff like jokes or casual language.  \n   • Only after you have a concise summary of the user’s intent should you apply your policy rules.  \n   This two-step approach often reduces the chance that the gatekeeper will get confused by colloquial or combined requests.\n\n2. Provide exemplar user inputs with explicit “thinking steps.”  \n   • In your prompt, give small examples of user requests that are slightly messy (slang, multiple requests, ambiguous phrasing).  \n   • Show how you want the model to arrive at a simplified, standardized “intent label” or structured action request.  \n   • Then show how you apply the validity rules (e.g., “Is the requested action permissible?”).  \n   Seeing how you work through multiple examples can help the model generalize.\n\n3. Set clear boundaries on what the gatekeeper should ignore.  \n   • If the user lumps in an out-of-scope request (like “tell me a joke”), you can instruct the model to ignore or flag that part as “irrelevant to the system’s core function.”  \n   • Make it explicit: “If an input includes additional content outside the scope of [list of valid system actions], do not try to fulfill or interpret that content—just warn or note it.”\n\n4. Rely on short, consistent language in the policy.  \n   • Overly verbose or “soft” rules often confuse models and lead them to guess or hallucinate.  \n   • Keep your policy statements succinct, and use the same terms each time you refer to an action or condition (e.g., “Valid request,” “Invalid request,” “Requires additional user clarification”).\n\n5. Iteratively test real-world “noisy” queries.  \n   • Collect real usage logs (or plausible mock requests) with typos, synonyms, partial commands, combined instructions, etc.  \n   • See where your gatekeeper fails: is it rejecting valid queries or letting through invalid ones?  \n   • Adjust your examples and policy prompt to address those specific failure modes.\n\n6. Think about fallback escalation.  \n   • For borderline cases or uncertain intent, you could direct the gatekeeper to respond with “clarify” or “ask for more details” rather than rejecting or accepting.  \n   • This approach can reduce the friction of false negatives: if the user clarifies, the gatekeeper can try again with a better signal.\n\n7. Keep human oversight in the loop for early phases.  \n   • If you’re deploying this in a real environment, you might want to route borderline or “confidence-lacking” requests to a human or a more thorough validation step.  \n   • Over time, you’ll see patterns and can refine the model’s prompt accordingly.\n\nThese strategies should help your gatekeeper model become more robust. By splitting the process into understanding the user’s true intent first, then applying policy logic, you reduce the chance of mixing the “what” and the “should we?” questions.

          "response": "It sounds like you’re dealing with the classic filtering trade-off when bridging human language use and precise system commands. Let me break down and clarify the main points:\n\n1. The Two Goals of Your Gatekeeper:\n • It needs to “understand” colloquial or imprecise language (like “kinda delete this channel”) and correctly map it to your formal action (“delete channel”).\n • It must also protect your expensive downstream system by not processing extraneous or unintended requests (like parts of the request that aren’t within scope, such as “tell me a joke” when the intent is primarily a channel operation).\n\n2. The Struggle With Prompt Strictness:\n • Too strict a prompt may only recognize very rigid, predetermined commands and reject valid user intent if it’s expressed casually or with extra wording.\n • Too flexible a prompt risks pulling in extra information or “hallucinating” actions that shouldn’t be processed, especially if a single input contains multiple parts (one valid, one extra).\n\n3. What This Means for Your Approach:\n • You need a prompt (or set of prompts) that can parse out the core valid command from the rest of the message. This might mean instructing your gatekeeper to focus on a particular domain (e.g., channel operations only) and ignore unrelated \"flavor\" text.\n • Consider designing steps in your system: first, a parsing stage that identifies the action, and second, a confirmation or normalization stage where the identified command is re-summarized. This could let you have a “safety net” by clarifying ambiguous input before it reaches the expensive model.\n • You might also consider a tiered confidence approach. For example, if your model isn’t sufficiently confident that the intent is solely within the intended domain, it could ask clarifying questions or simply reject/flag the ambiguous request.\n\n4. Additional Thoughts:\n • Think about adding examples to your prompt that illustrate both acceptable and unacceptable variations. Showing examples like “kinda delete this channel” as valid, but clearly noting that requests mixing operations (like deletion plus providing a joke) should have the non-key parts stripped or require clarification, can help the model learn these boundaries.\n • Another angle is to decide whether you’ll allow mixed requests at all. If any additional components beyond the core command make it “too noisy,” your filter might simply ask: “Did you mean to delete the channel? Please confirm so we can proceed.” This keeps it safe even if it means a little extra conversation.\n\nIn summary, your gatekeeper is essentially acting like a human operator who must interpret casual language accurately while ignoring off-topic embellishments. The challenge is finding the balance in your prompt so that it’s neither too rigid (risking false negatives) nor too open-ended (risking processing unwanted actions). It’s a classic design space problem in natural language understanding, and the solution often involves iterative testing with real user inputs, prompt adjustments, and maybe even a multi-step process.\n\nDoes this help in clarifying your challenge and potential strategies?",

This is a common issue when trying to build robust and reliable natural language processing systems. Let me share some thoughts and strategies that may help:\n\n1. **Define a Clear Scope**: Start by clearly defining the scope of valid user requests that your gatekeeper LLM should handle. This will help you set the right expectations and boundaries for the model. Identify the core actions (e.g., create, delete, update) and the specific entities (e.g., channels, users, files) that your system should be able to process.\n\n2. **Iterative Prompt Refinement**: Approach the prompt design in an iterative manner. Start with a relatively strict prompt that focuses on the core valid actions and entities. Then, gradually expand the prompt by introducing more flexibility and handling common colloquial expressions, while closely monitoring the model's performance and behaviors.\n\n3. **Leverage Prompt Engineering Techniques**: Explore different prompt engineering techniques to strike the right balance. For example, you could try:\n   - Using a multi-stage prompt, where the first stage focuses on validating the core request, and the second stage handles additional context or nuance.\n   - Incorporating clarifying questions or request reformulation suggestions to handle ambiguous or out-of-scope inputs.\n   - Leveraging few-shot examples or demonstrations to guide the model's understanding of valid requests.\n\n4. **Extensive Testing and Evaluation**: Invest time in thoroughly testing your gatekeeper LLM with a diverse set of user inputs, including both valid and invalid requests. Analyze the model's responses, identify edge cases, and iterate on the prompt accordingly.\n\n5. **Incorporate Feedback Loops**: Consider building feedback mechanisms that allow users to provide feedback on the gatekeeper LLM's performance. This can help you identify areas for improvement and further refine the prompt over time.\n\n6. **Leverage Contextual Information**: If possible, try to incorporate additional contextual information (e.g., user profile, previous interactions, system state) into the prompt to help the model make more informed decisions.\n\n7. **Explore Ensemble Approaches**: Consider combining multiple LLM models or other techniques (e.g., rule-based systems, heuristics) to create a more robust and reliable gatekeeper system.\n\nThe key is to find the right balance between flexibility and safety, which often requires a combination of thoughtful prompt design, extensive testing, and an iterative approach.

Here are some strategies and perspectives that might help you refine your gatekeeper approach:\n\n**1. Layered Filtering (Multi-pass Approach)**\n- **First pass:** Use a lightweight, rules-based filter to catch obvious out-of-scope or malformed requests (e.g., regex for known banned phrases, basic intent keywords).\n- **Second pass:** Let the LLM handle ambiguous or borderline cases. The prompt here can be more nuanced, since the really obvious stuff is already filtered.\n\n**2. Explicit Scope Definition**\n- In the prompt, clearly enumerate the allowed actions and provide a few positive and negative examples. \n- For instance:  \n  > Only validate requests that match these actions: [create channel, delete channel, ...].  \n  > Example valid: \"Please delete this channel.\"  \n  > Example invalid: \"Tell me a joke.\"\n- This helps the model anchor its understanding and resist hallucinating actions.\n\n**3. Intent Extraction Instead of Full Validation**\n- Ask the LLM to extract the core user intent as a structured output. Then, validate that intent (using code or rules) rather than relying on the model to decide validity.\n- This reduces pressure on the model to \"filter,\" and instead leverages its strength in natural language understanding.\n\n**4. Handling Colloquial/Noisy Inputs**\n- Add explicit examples in your prompt that demonstrate how to interpret casual or slightly off-spec language (\"kinda delete this channel\" → \"delete channel\").\n- Encourage the model to \"normalize\" intent, but not to expand or invent new capabilities.\n\n**5. Instruction on Ignoring Irrelevant Parts**\n- Tell the model to ignore irrelevant parts of the request:  \n  > If the request includes both valid and invalid actions, only process the valid action and ignore the rest.\n  > For example: \"Create a channel and tell me a joke\" → Only \"create a channel\" is relevant.\n\n**6. Conservative Default**\n- If uncertain, instruct the model to err on the side of rejection or ask for clarification, rather than guessing.\n\n**7. Continual Evaluation**\n- Collect edge cases, analyze misses, and update your prompt with new examples. This iterative process is key to improving reliability.\n\n**8. Consider Model Choice**\n- Sometimes, a smaller or more \"literal\" model (e.g., Claude Instant, GPT-3.5) is less likely to hallucinate or over-generalize than a more powerful, creative one.\n\n**Summary:**  \nYou’re not alone—this is a nuanced problem! Success comes from clear scope, lots of examples, frequent prompt iteration, and sometimes using multiple layers (rules + LLM).

          "response": "A couple of angles might be worth exploring:\n\n1. Two-Stage Reasoning vs. Simple Keyword Matching  \n   • If the “gatekeeper” first summarizes the user’s intent in a neutral format—free of extra detail—and only then decides if it’s valid or not, you often get fewer random rejections.  \n   • Combining that reasoning step with a more traditional keyword/regex check can help control for out-of-scope content (e.g., if the user wants something disallowed, the second step catches it).  \n\n2. Handle Chat-Like, Colloquial Inputs Directly in the Prompt  \n   • Sometimes the filter fails because it’s trying to interpret everyday language too literally. In your system instructions, you can say, “Expect colloquial language and interpret user requests according to common sense.”  \n   • Provide a few examples where the user is borderline informal or ambiguous—show how to parse that into a clear request.  \n\n3. Calibrate For Edge Cases with Testing  \n   • Gather a bunch of real user inputs—especially from the edge or corner cases—and see where the filter fails. Then refine the prompt to handle those exact examples.  \n   • If you can do some A/B testing with different prompt wordings—like “Be lenient, but do not pass requests that clearly violate policy”—and see which wording yields fewer false rejections vs. fewer misses.  \n\n4. Mark “Additional Details” as Out-of-Scope for Gatekeeper  \n   • If the user tacks on an unrelated request (like “tell me a joke”), the filter should only decide on the main action (e.g., “create a channel”). The joke is out-of-scope for the gatekeeper. You can explicitly instruct the gatekeeper: “Ignore any secondary or unrelated requests; only validate if the main request is permissible.”  \n\n5. Fail Soft, Not Hard  \n   • If the gatekeeper is genuinely unsure, it might respond with a clarifying question: “Do you mean X or Y?” Then pass that along so the user can confirm. This is less frustrating than an outright rejection, and it’ll help you gather data to refine the prompt.  \n\nHope that helps. Feel free to DM if you want to chat more about specific prompting examples or ways to calibrate the filter in practice. Good luck!",

          "response": "Here are some high-level strategies and ideas that might help you strike the balance between strictness and flexibility for your gatekeeper LLM:\n\n1. Clarify and decompose the user intent:  \n • Instead of having the gatekeeper decide on the complete validity of a compound request, you could split the request into its constituent actions. For example, ask the LLM first to “parse the intent” out of the natural language input before labeling which parts are in-scope vs. out-of-scope.  \n • You might instruct it to return one or more discrete commands (with a confidence score or explanation) and then simply pass along requests that meet a clear “allowed” pattern to the more expensive model.\n\n2. Use few-shot examples and counter-examples in your prompt:  \n • Providing examples of both acceptable colloquial phrasing (like “kinda delete this channel” → “delete”) and unacceptable compound requests (like “create a channel and tell me a joke”) can help the LLM calibrate its interpretation.  \n • Make sure some examples explicitly illustrate what to do when multiple tasks are detected. For instance, “If the user request contains more than one instruction, only validate the part that is in scope, or ask for clarification.”\n\n3. Encourage reasoning (and maybe chain-of-thought) in the gatekeeper’s output:  \n • A prompt that instructs the LLM to first state the inferred command or summarize the primary intent can help avoid hallucinating additional actions.  \n • For example, “Please analyze the user's input and then output only one clear command action. If there is additional content beyond the command, ignore it.” This extra step forces the model to “think” through the request rather than trying to handle every bit of it.\n\n4. Make the gatekeeper deliberately conservative:  \n • One option is to have the gatekeeper confirm clarity before passing an action through. If the interpretation is ambiguous or if multiple commands are detected, it could simply default to not passing anything on and either asking for clarification or rejecting the command.  \n • This might slightly reduce the hit rate on valid inputs, but it will help avoid cases where hallucinated extra actions slip through.\n\n5. Consider a two-phase system:  \n • Use one prompt to “extract” actionable commands and a second, simpler prompt to quickly validate that the command is clean and in-scope.  \n • This separation may allow for a more controlled process and easier troubleshooting of where the misclassification occurs.\n\n6. Build in error-handling or fallback mechanisms:  \n • For inputs that almost pass the filter but still have some extra “flair” or commands, you could have the system confirm with the user: “Did you mean to execute only X?”  \n • Such a fallback can reduce the risk of either discarding a valid but informal command or accidentally processing out-of-scope instructions.\n\n7. Iterate and monitor:  \n • Regardless of which approach you choose, real-world testing is key. Logging edge cases and iteratively refining your prompt based on actual user input will likely help iron out unexpected behaviors.  \n • If possible, have a manual review process in the early stages to catch failures and then feed that back into your prompt design.\n\nIn summary, the key is to explicitly decompose the command, provide clear instructions (preferably with examples) on what constitutes an allowed and disallowed request, and consider making your gatekeeping multi-step so that any ambiguity can be managed. This layered approach might help you ensure that valid, colloquial requests are understood while discarding extra, out-of-scope actions. \n\nHope these ideas help spark some useful experimentation in your system design!",

Getting this balance right is tricky, but here are some strategies that have helped me break through similar loops:\n\n### 1. **Explicit Action Enumeration & Intent Clarification**\nInstead of broadly prompting your gatekeeper LLM to \"validate requests,\" explicitly define a limited set of supported actions and their expected intents. For example:\n\n- **Allowed actions:** \"create channel,\" \"delete channel,\" \"update channel settings,\" \"invite user,\" etc.\n- **Unsupported actions:** \"tell jokes,\" \"general conversation,\" \"off-topic commands,\" etc.\n\nYour prompt might then encourage the model to classify each request into these categories explicitly, rather than leave interpretation open-ended.\n\n### 2. **Intent Extraction as a Separate Step**\nBreak down the validation into two distinct steps:\n\n- **Intent Extractor (Gatekeeper LLM)**: Clearly define a task prompt focused solely on extracting the intended action(s) from the user's input. This prompt should be designed purely to identify intent without judgment (\"kinda delete channel\" → intent = delete channel).\n- **Intent Validator (Simple Logical Check)**: A second step (often simpler and rule-based, or using a short prompt) checks whether the extracted intent is explicitly permitted. This reduces hallucination risks, as the validator is no longer doing open-ended reasoning.\n\nThis two-step pipeline helps separate the \"colloquial understanding\" challenge from the \"permissions validation\" challenge.\n\n### 3. **Constrained Output Formats**\nConsider constraining the LLM's outputs to a structured JSON or YAML format. For example:\n\n```\n{\n  \"intent\": \"delete_channel\",\n  \"certainty\": \"medium\",\n  \"notes\": \"Colloquial phrasing detected\"\n}\n```\n\nThis helps the model focus strictly on structured intent extraction rather than general problem-solving or conversational interpretation. It also makes downstream validation logic straightforward.\n\n### 4. **Few-shot Examples to Cover Colloquial Variations**\nProvide a small set of carefully crafted few-shot examples that explicitly include informal, ambiguous, or colloquial language, along with how you expect these inputs to be classified. For example, include phrases like `\"kinda delete this channel\"` and `\"can you maybe create a new group?\"` to demonstrate the desired flexibility without compromising strictness.\n\n### 5. **Chain-of-Thought Prompting**\nIf you're still seeing hallucinations or validation mistakes, consider prompting explicitly for a brief chain-of-thought reasoning. For example, ask the model explicitly to \"first identify the primary user intent from the input, then check if that intent is supported by the system's defined capabilities,\" and finally produce a short structured output. This helps the model avoid premature decisions and reduces hallucinations.\n\n### 6. **Prompt Injection & Safety Checks**\nExplicitly instruct the model to reject or ignore any additional, unrelated requests included in a single command (\"create a channel and tell me a joke\"). You can even explicitly state \"If the request contains multiple intents, only accept the explicitly supported intent and ignore or reject other unrelated intents.\"\n\n---\n\nI've found that applying these strategies individually or in combination usually breaks through the type of loop you're stuck in. Each scenario is slightly different, but hopefully, these approaches resonate with your current challenge.\n\nHappy to chat further if you have follow-up questions or need clarification on these strategies!",

Here are some strategies and considerations from my experience working with LLM-based agents and guardrails:\n\n### 1. **Prompt Engineering: Layered Instructions**\n- **Explicitly separate the tasks**: In your prompt, tightly scope what the model should do, e.g., \"Only validate whether the user's request matches one of these allowed actions: [list]. Ignore all unrelated content.\"\n- **Ask for a structured output**, like:\n  ```\n  Action: [action or \"none\"]\n  Valid: [yes/no]\n  Reason: [short, 1-sentence explanation]\n  ```\n  This keeps the model focused and makes downstream logic easier.\n\n### 2. **Leverage Examples (Few-shot)**\n- Give the gatekeeper prompt a series of positive and negative examples, including edge cases:\n  - Colloquial, misspelled, or multi-intent requests\n  - Clearly invalid or ambiguous requests\n- This helps it generalize better to \"kinda delete this channel\" without getting too loose.\n\n### 3. **Intent Extraction + Action Filtering**\n- Consider a two-step gatekeeper:\n  1. **Intent extraction**: \"What does the user want to do?\"\n  2. **Action filtering**: \"Is this intent allowed?\"\n- This separation can reduce hallucinations and scope creep.\n\n### 4. **Explicit Refusal Instructions**\n- In your prompt, tell the model: \"If the user's request contains multiple actions, only process the first valid action. Do not attempt unrelated tasks or answer other questions.\"\n\n### 5. **Post-Processing/Hard Filters**\n- Use the LLM to extract possible intents, but have a deterministic (non-LLM) layer that only allows through specific, pre-approved actions/commands. This way, even if the model gets creative, the output is filtered.\n\n### 6. **Regular Evaluation & Feedback Loops**\n- Continuously collect cases where the filter fails (too strict/loose) and refine your few-shot examples or prompts accordingly.\n- Automated tests with diverse, real-world user phrasing are invaluable.\n\n### 7. **Fallback to User Clarification**\n- When in doubt or on ambiguous input, instruct the gatekeeper to **ask the user for clarification** rather than guessing or hallucinating.\n\n---\n\n**Final Thought:**  \nYou’ll never get 100% perfect with LLMs, but combining prompt engineering, layered validation, and fallback mechanisms gets you close. The trick is to keep the LLM’s job as *narrow* and *explicit* as possible, and to handle ambiguity with safe defaults or clarifications.\n\nHappy to discuss further if you want to DM!",

          "response": "It sounds like you’re trying to strike a careful balance between “loose enough to accept real user language” and “strict enough not to hallucinate or attempt out-of-bounds tasks.” A few high-level strategies might help:\n\n1. Think in terms of layered validation.  \n   • First, do a lightweight check (could be a smaller or simpler model or even some rule-based filtering) to confirm the user request is “on-topic” or “in-domain” at a high level. This check doesn’t attempt deeper interpretation—just a quick yes/no on whether the request is obviously disallowed or unrelated.  \n   • If it passes, then you bring in the bigger gatekeeper LLM for deeper analysis.  \n   • This layered approach means the gatekeeper model can focus on real requests instead of spending time batting away complete nonsense.\n\n2. Separate the “intent detection” from the “action gating.”  \n   • Sometimes, it helps to have the gatekeeper do two distinct steps: (1) restate or clarify the user’s request in a canonical form, and (2) decide whether that canonical form is allowed.  \n   • For example, if a user says “kinda delete this channel?” the gatekeeper might first rewrite that to “User wants to: delete channel X.” Then it checks, “Is ‘delete channel X’ allowed?”  \n   • This structure keeps the model from mixing up the user’s style (“kinda delete?”) with whether it’s a valid request (“delete channel”).\n\n3. Carefully control what context you provide in the gatekeeper prompt.  \n   • Overly broad system messages (“You’re a super-intelligent assistant—answer everything!”) can make the gatekeeper model try to accommodate out-of-scope or multi-step tasks, because it thinks it’s supposed to be “helpful” above all else.  \n   • Tuning the system prompt to emphasize “stay in lane; only interpret request and decide if it’s valid within these specific rules” can rein in hallucinations.  \n   • You might also include “if the request is for multiple actions, confirm if the main action is valid; do not attempt the rest” or something to that effect. \n\n4. Provide examples of tricky, borderline cases and the correct response.  \n   • Few-shot prompting is usually crucial for gatekeeper tasks.  \n   • Show the model exactly how you’d like it to handle requests that are colloquial vs. requests that stray into out-of-scope tasks.  \n   • For each example, highlight the reasoning or the correct outcome. LLMs are quite sensitive to strong examples demonstrating the boundary between “the request is valid and should be passed on” and “the request is out of scope, so respond with a refusal.”\n\n5. Tolerate minor variability, but be consistent about the “core” rule.  \n   • Completely eliminating small differences in the gatekeeper’s output is challenging. LLMs can vary in style.  \n   • As long as the gatekeeper remains consistent on the critical pass/fail decision and doesn’t conflate out-of-scope requests with in-scope requests, a bit of variability in phrasing is usually acceptable.  \n   • In practice, you measure success by how often valid requests get mistakenly blocked vs. how often invalid requests slip through, and you keep refining your prompts from there.\n\n6. Consider disclaimers or partial responses for multi-intent requests.  \n   • When a user does something like, “create a channel and tell me a joke,” you can instruct the gatekeeper to accept the “create a channel” part (if valid) but ignore or respond generically to the “tell me a joke” part.  \n   • This might look like: “Main action is creation of a channel: valid. Secondary request is out of scope. Passing only the valid action forward.”  \n   • Or, if that’s not your desired user experience, you might let the gatekeeper flag it to the next model to handle the channel creation while clearly labeling the second request as “additional request: might be ignored or processed differently.”\n\n7. Keep iterating and logging near misses.  \n   • Gatekeeping is rarely perfect right away. It often requires iterative improvement—gather logs of real user requests that were incorrectly rejected or incorrectly passed through, then refine examples or the system message to address those.  \n   • If you see certain patterns of inaccuracy (e.g., colloquial language being misread, or multi-step requests getting combined incorrectly), adding specific examples of those patterns and how to handle them can do wonders.\n\nEven though it can feel like you’re going in circles, sometimes a well-placed example or a small shift in the system prompt can significantly boost reliability. The key is to keep your guardrails clear about which kinds of actions/translations the gatekeeper is responsible for, then show examples that demonstrate boundary conditions in the training prompt. \n\nGood luck! If you tweak one variable at a time (like the system message vs. the few-shot examples) and watch how the model’s decisions change, you’ll eventually zero in on a sweet spot where it’s neither too strict nor too lenient.",

          "response": "Here are some thoughts and strategies that might help you strike the right balance with your gatekeeper:\n\n1. Define clear boundaries:  \n • First, list the specific actions or intents your downstream system supports. Having a clear taxonomy lets you build prompts that check if the user’s input falls within this list.  \n • Use explicit language in the prompt (or a chain-of-thought) to instruct the LLM to decide whether the user request matches one of these specific actions, rather than trying to “understand” a wide range of natural language queries.\n\n2. Use tiered evaluation (a “coarse-to-fine” approach):  \n • Have one prompt that roughly classifies intent using simple keyword matching or few-shot examples; this step can be intentionally lenient so that colloquial phrasing doesn’t get rejected outright.  \n • In a second step, if the initial result is positive, perform a more specific validation. For example, you might ask the model to “explain its understanding” or “list its reasoning” for why the request fits an allowed category. If the explanation is fuzzy or indicates elements from out-of-scope actions (like adding jokes), then you can flag it.\n\n3. Provide boundary examples in the prompt:  \n • Include examples that show both valid and invalid requests. For valid requests, cover as many colloquial or slightly off-form formulations as you can.  \n • Likewise, add examples where mixing in out-of-scope intents (like combining an allowed action with extraneous unrelated requests) should trigger a rejection. These examples help calibrate the model’s sensitivity.\n\n4. Chain-of-thought or step-by-step reasoning:  \n • Encourage the model to articulate its understanding step by step (“first, I recognized that the user wants to delete a channel...”).  \n • This can help catch when the model starts incorporating undesired parts (for instance if it begins to validate the joke). If you can parse the chain-of-thought for off-topic content, you can improve filtering.  \n • Even if you’re not using the chain-of-thought output directly for the gating decision, it might be useful for debugging where the model’s reasoning goes astray.\n\n5. Ask the model to “disassemble” the query:  \n • Instead of asking “is this a valid request?”, you might instruct the model to extract the list of intended actions from the input.  \n • Then, compare the extracted actions against a whitelist. This indirect evaluation makes it easier to decide when a request contains any unexpected operations.\n\n6. Consider using conservative fallback strategies:  \n • When the model’s confidence is low or the reasoning seems ambiguous, default to rejecting the request or sending it to a higher-level agent for clarification.  \n • This might be an acceptable trade-off: rather than risk executing an out-of-scope action, have a short turnaround asking for clarification.\n\n7. Iterative prompt tuning and user feedback:  \n • Since language nuances vary, iterative testing with diverse samples is key. Gather logs of borderline cases and adjust your prompt iteratively.  \n • This kind of feedback loop is common in robust LLM agent setups, where you refine the instructions until you achieve the desired balance.\n\nIn essence, rather than trying to set a static “strictness” level, a dynamic, multi-step approach can help mitigate the risks associated with being too rigid or too lax. Combining explicit instructions, examples, and multi-step validation (or extraction) should provide the “second opinion” your system needs before delegating to the high-powered model.\n\nHope these ideas spark a new angle for your implementation!",

          "response": "This is indeed a common challenge in building robust guardrails for multi-layered LLM systems. Here are some strategic guidelines that have successfully worked in similar scenarios:\n\n### 1. Consider a Multi-stage Prompting Approach:\n- **Intent Classification First:**  \n  Instead of directly passing user prompts to the \"gatekeeper,\" first explicitly classify the user's intent into a limited set of predefined categories (\"delete\", \"create\", \"read-only\", \"irrelevant\", etc.).\n- **Validation Second:**  \n  After identifying a clear intent, run a validation prompt that checks if the request aligns with your predefined allowed actions. This reduces complexity for the validation step and avoids hallucinations.\n\n### 2. Prompt Engineering Strategies:\n- **Few-shot Examples:**  \n  Provide a balanced set of examples (both formal and informal phrasing) right in your prompt. This helps the gatekeeper recognize colloquial variations like `\"kinda delete this channel\"`.\n- **Explicit Scope and Boundary Definition:**  \n  Clearly outline the allowed actions and explicitly instruct the LLM to reject or flag out-of-scope or ambiguous requests. For instance:\n  ```\n  \"Allowed actions: create, delete, update, read. Reject requests that contain ambiguous or unrelated instructions (e.g., jokes, small talk, unrelated queries). If unsure, ask for clarification.\"\n  ```\n\n### 3. Granular Intent Taxonomy:\n- Consider breaking down requests into granular subactions. For example, `\"create a channel and tell me a joke\"` might break down into two intents:  \n  - valid intent (\"create channel\")  \n  - invalid intent (\"tell joke\").\n- Your gatekeeper can then explicitly isolate and reject the invalid intent, prompting the user to clarify or resubmit.\n\n### 4. Confidence Thresholding:\n- Consider using confidence scores (log-probs or softmax probabilities) returned by the gatekeeper model. If confidence falls below a certain threshold, you can prompt the user for clarification instead of directly rejecting or accepting.\n\n### 5. Chain-of-Thought Prompting:\n- Encourage the gatekeeper to explicitly reason step-by-step before giving a final decision. This has been proven effective in reducing hallucinations and misinterpretations. For example:\n  ```\n  \"Step 1: Identify main intent(s).  \n   Step 2: Check if identified intent(s) match allowed actions.  \n   Step 3: Confirm no unrelated or ambiguous instructions exist.  \n   Step 4: Accept or reject clearly, with reasoning.\"\n  ```\n\n### 6. Hybrid Rule-Based + Model-Based Filtering:\n- While you want a natural-language understanding gatekeeper, a lightweight rule-based pre-filter (regex, keyword check, etc.) can cheaply discard clearly irrelevant or malicious requests upfront, reducing the complexity for the gatekeeper.\n\n---\n\n**In practice**, most teams end up combining several of these approaches. A good middle ground often looks like:\n\n- Rule-based pre-filtering → Intent classifier (LLM) → Intent validation (LLM with explicit guardrail prompts) → Expensive model.\n\nEach stage reduces the complexity for the next, ensuring your final \"gatekeeper\" can focus on nuanced validation rather than basic intent classification.\n\nIf you want to dive deeper into any of these strategies or discuss your specific scenario further, let me know—I'm happy to continue the conversation.",

The key insight is that you shouldn't try to solve this with a single prompt - you need a layered approach.\n\n## Strategic Recommendations:\n\n### 1. **Decompose the Problem**\nInstead of one omnipotent gatekeeper, consider:\n- **Intent Extraction Layer**: First normalize the user input to canonical intents\n- **Validation Layer**: Then validate against your allowed action set\n- **Scope Checking Layer**: Finally ensure no out-of-scope additions\n\n### 2. **Use Few-Shot Examples Strategically**\nStructure your prompt with explicit positive and negative examples:\n```\nValid: \"kinda delete this channel\" → PASS (maps to: delete_channel)\nInvalid: \"delete this channel and tell me a joke\" → FAIL (contains out-of-scope: joke)\n```\n\n### 3. **Implement \"Strict Mode with Exceptions\"**\n- Start with strict validation\n- Build an explicit \"colloquialism mapper\" that translates common variations\n- This gives you control without losing flexibility\n\n### 4. **Consider a Confidence Threshold**\nHave your gatekeeper return confidence scores. Route edge cases to a human or a more sophisticated model for review.\n\n### 5. **Test with Adversarial Inputs**\nAs an ethical hacker, you know this - but build a test suite with:\n- Injection attempts\n- Multi-intent requests  \n- Ambiguous phrasings\n- Common misspellings/variations\n\nWould love to discuss specific prompt engineering techniques or architectural patterns if you want to dive deeper!",

          "response": "You’re absolutely tackling a real and nuanced problem—balancing precision versus recall in LLM-based validation, especially when the stakes are high, is not trivial. Here are some high-level strategies and mental models that might help you break out of the loop:\n\n**1. Explicit, Multi-Step Reasoning in the Prompt**\n- Instead of a single fuzzy “is this valid?” check, prompt the gatekeeper model to explicitly reason through the request in steps. For example:\n    - “First, identify the core action(s) the user is requesting. Then, for each action, state whether it is within scope and why. Only allow requests where all actions are within scope.”\n- This method helps the model avoid getting distracted by irrelevant parts (“tell me a joke”) and focus on what’s actionable.\n\n**2. Intent Extraction > Validation**\n- Consider splitting the process:\n    1. First, extract the *intent* (or intents) from the user’s message in structured form.\n    2. Then, validate the extracted intent(s) against your action whitelist.\n- This reduces the model’s need to do both semantic parsing and validation in one fuzzy step, which is error-prone.\n\n**3. Reject Ambiguity**\n- If the model is unsure, have it default to a safe response: “Sorry, I couldn’t confidently identify a valid action.” This reduces hallucination risk at the cost of some friction for edge-case users, but is much safer in high-stakes settings.\n\n**4. Fine-Tuning vs. Prompting**\n- If you find yourself hitting the limits of prompt engineering, consider a small fine-tuning pass (if feasible) with a dataset of borderline/edge-case requests. This often helps models handle colloquial or tricky phrasing better.\n\n**5. Layered Filtering**\n- Don’t put *all* your eggs in the LLM basket. Consider lightweight, deterministic pre-filters (e.g., regex or keyword checks for obviously invalid or ambiguous requests) before the LLM, and post-filters for safety after.\n\n**6. Human-in-the-Loop for Uncertain Cases**\n- If feasible, route ambiguous or “low confidence” cases for human review, at least until you have more confidence in the system’s performance.\n\n**7. Prompt Style**\n- Try meta-prompts: “You are a gatekeeper whose ONLY job is to check if a request is a valid, in-scope action. You must IGNORE requests for jokes, chit-chat, or any action not specifically allowed. If you are unsure, reject the request.”\n- You can also force the model to always answer in a structured format (e.g., `Action Detected: [Yes/No]. Reason: [...]`), which helps with downstream handling and consistency.\n\n**Summary:**  \nYou’re not alone—this is a common pain point! The sweet spot is often achieved by combining explicit reasoning in the prompt, intent extraction, and fallback mechanisms for ambiguity. If you want to talk specific scenarios or examples, feel free to share a few and we can work through edge cases.\n\n**Lives are at stake:** Since you mentioned this, err on the side of being overly cautious—false negatives (missing a legitimate request) are usually less dangerous than false positives (allowing a harmful or invalid action).\n\nHope this helps, and happy to chat further!",

          "response": "Here’s a few strategic angles I’d consider:\n\n1) Use “intent + domain” classification first, then validate.  \n   • Instead of having a single big question—“What should I do with this request?”—split the pipeline into two. First, classify or parse the user’s intent (e.g., “delete resource,” “create resource,” “get status,” “joke,” etc.).  \n   • Once you have an intent, run separate validations or guidelines for each domain. For instance, if there’s “delete resource” intent, check for user authenticity or context. If it’s “create resource,” confirm the user’s parameters. If it’s “joke,” allow or dismiss.  \n   • This way, your gatekeeper prompt can be simpler, because it’s primarily identifying categories rather than fully validating all possible requests.\n\n2) Have the gatekeeper explicitly use clarifications when uncertain.  \n   • When you sense the user is “kinda” or “maybe” requesting something, for ambiguous inputs, instruct the gatekeeper to respond with a clarifying question. This defers the final decision until you’re sure the user means “delete.”  \n   • It reduces the risk of rejecting valid requests prematurely, while still stopping any potential out-of-scope or unsafe attempts.\n\n3) Provide robust examples—especially near-boundary ones.  \n   • The biggest gains often come from carefully chosen examples in your prompt or your training approach. Include examples of borderline (colloquial, alternative phrasing) requests labeled as “valid,” and also out-of-scope examples labeled as “reject.”  \n   • Make sure you show the difference in how each case is handled so the gatekeeper learns how you want borderline or multi-intent requests to be handled.\n\n4) Give the gatekeeper narrower instructions around scope, not around creativity.  \n   • Sometimes the gatekeeper “hallucinates” because the instructions are too broad. Narrow them to: “Identify if the user’s request matches our known set of valid commands. If not, pass through or ask clarifying questions. Do not add your own content.”  \n   • By focusing on scope (what the user can/can’t do) rather than how to say it, you minimize the hallucinatory expansions.\n\n5) Consider a fallback “affirmation” step on the user’s side.  \n   • If the user’s request is borderline or the gatekeeper is unsure, have the system generate a short restatement of the user’s request: “I’m going to ‘delete this channel,’ is that correct?”  \n   • This second check can save you from both false rejections (“kinda delete the channel” might be recognized once the user sees the restatement and clicks “Yes, that’s what I meant”).\n\n6) Iterate with real user data or real user phrasing (if available).  \n   • Synthetic examples only go so far. If you can test actual user queries, you’ll see a distribution of how people phrase requests. Bake those real-world phrasings into your few-shot or training data so that the gatekeeper learns from real variety.  \n   • Keep track of edge cases that fail and feed them back into your next round of examples.\n\nIn short, the underlying principle is to decouple:\n• Identifying what the user wants (intent classification)  \n• Deciding if it’s permissible or if you need clarification (validation)  \n\nWith that separation, you can refine each step more easily. I’ve found this layered approach reduces hallucinations, false negatives, and helps you tune guardrails precisely where you need them. Good luck!",

          "response": "When designing a gatekeeper prompt that needs to balance flexibility (to understand varied, colloquial inputs) and strictness (to avoid processing out-of-scope or hallucinated actions), there are several strategies you might consider:\n\n1. Define an explicit action space.  \n • Clearly list the permitted actions and any required parameters or acceptable synonyms. For example, if \"delete\" is allowed, include common variants like “remove,” “clear out,” “drop,” etc.  \n • Consider creating a short list of forbidden or unsupported tasks. This way, the gatekeeper can reference this “menu” of actions and respond in a predictable way if an input doesn’t match.\n\n2. Use examples and counterexamples within the prompt.  \n • For instance, provide a few validated inputs like “kinda delete this channel” along with a mapping that shows its intent (i.e., “delete”).  \n • Show examples where additional instructions (like asking for a joke) are considered out-of-scope. This guidance helps the model learn the boundary between acceptable and unacceptable requests.\n\n3. Leverage multi-step reasoning (chain-of-thought).  \n • Ask the model to first restate the user intent in its own words and then decide if it falls within the allowed operations. This can help catch ambiguous or mixed queries.  \n • For example, instruct the model: “Step 1: Summarize the action requested. Step 2: Check if this action is within [action list]. Step 3: If yes, output the standardized action; otherwise, reject or ask for clarification.”\n\n4. Separate intent extraction from execution instructions.  \n • If possible, run a two-stage process where the gatekeeper first solely translates the natural language input into a standardized command (and possibly validates against a whitelist) before anything else is done.  \n • This decoupling makes it easier to identify and isolate unwanted requests (e.g., jokes) early in the process.\n\n5. Introduce an “ambiguity check” or request clarification.  \n • For mixed requests like “create a channel and tell me a joke,” design the prompt such that if more than one distinct intent is detected, the system asks the user to confirm exactly what they want to do.  \n • This approach both prevents unintended processing and reinforces that the gatekeeper only supports a single, clearly defined operation at a time.\n\n6. Engineer gentle defaults over hard rejections.  \n • In ambiguous cases where the intent is mostly valid (like colloquial language for permitted actions), try to err on the side of mapping them to a standard command rather than outright rejecting them.  \n • You might instruct the model to “normalize” the command if it’s close enough to one of the allowed actions.\n\n7. Monitor and iterate based on actual usage.  \n • Real-world usage often reveals edge cases that are hard to predict. Build logging and feedback loops so that the system can be refined with additional examples or rules as ambiguities are discovered.\n\n8. Provide explicit guidance on handling extraneous content.  \n • Ask the model to ignore parts of the input that pertain to non-matching actions. For instance, specifying “If additional requests that are not in the allowed list are present, strictly process only the valid part and disregard the rest” can help keep the gatekeeper focused.\n\nBy combining these approaches, you can tune the prompt to be both resilient to varied user language and robust against requests that could otherwise lead to unexpected behavior. It often comes down to iteratively testing the gatekeeper with real-world examples and adjusting the prompt (or using prompt chaining) to find that “sweet spot” between flexibility and strictness.\n\nIn summary, think about your gatekeeper prompt as a layered process where:\n • It first clarifies intent by mapping input to a predefined action space.\n • It then validates whether that intent is permitted.\n • If the input contains mixed messages or extraneous content, it either normalizes or asks for clarification.\n\nThis methodical breakdown not only helps in understanding what the user is trying to do but also provides clear boundaries for what the system will execute, which is crucial when lives (and resources) are at stake.",

Here are some thoughts on strategies and approaches—no code, just conceptual:\n\n1. Specify \"Primary Action Only\":\n   Make it very clear in your prompt that the gatekeeper should focus on the main actionable intent, and ignore unrelated requests. For example:  \n   \"Identify and validate only the primary user action relevant to system commands. Ignore unrelated or secondary requests, jokes, or conversational filler.\"\n2. Use Examples (Few-Shot):\n   Include examples in your prompt for borderline cases, especially those that have tripped up the model. For instance:  \n   - Input: \"kinda delete this channel\" → VALID (\"delete channel\")\n   - Input: \"create a channel and tell me a joke\" → VALID (\"create channel\"), IGNORE (\"joke\")\n   - Input: \"can you ban the trolls?\" → VALID (\"ban users\")\n   This helps the model generalize intent without overreaching.\n3. Layered Filtering:\n   Consider a two-pass system:  \n   - Pass 1: Filter for clear-cut invalid or malicious requests (e.g., prompt injection, policy violations).\n   - Pass 2: Normalize colloquial or ambiguous language to canonical commands, then validate.\n4. Explicit Scoping:\n   Instruct the gatekeeper to only allow through actions that map exactly to your system's capabilities. For example:  \n   \"Only accept requests that match the following actions: [list of actions]. If a request includes unrelated content, validate only the relevant action.\"\n5. Reject (or Flag) Multi-Intent Requests:\n   If multi-intent requests are problematic, consider instructing the gatekeeper to reject or flag them, or only process the actionable part.\n6. Iterative Prompt Refinement:\n   Maintain a live log of failures and ambiguous cases. Regularly review and update your prompt and examples as you see patterns in user input.\n7. Consider Output Format:\n   Ask the gatekeeper to output both the validated action and a \"reason\"—this can help you debug borderline cases and improve the prompt over time.\n8. Human-in-the-Loop for Edge Cases:\n   For requests that are borderline or ambiguous, route them for manual review.\n9. Model Choice Matters:\n   Smaller/cheaper models may be more \"literal\" and thus stricter, while more powerful models can be more flexible (and sometimes more hallucination-prone). Tune expectations accordingly.\nThis is an iterative process! Your system will get smarter as you log and learn from real user behavior.\n\nIf you want to DM for a more focused brainstorm or want to share specific prompt examples, happy to help further.

Small iterative changes—like clarifying your instructions, adding examples, or splitting the request flow—often have a big impact on hitting that sweet spot between being too permissive and overzealous.

          "response": "It sounds like you’re running up against one of the classic trade-offs of natural language systems: being strict enough to avoid vulnerability or unintended behavior, yet flexible enough to understand informal language. Here are some strategic ideas that might help you find a better balance:\n\n1. Use a multi-step approach. Instead of a single gatekeeper prompt, you might let the initial LLM process the input for intent extraction. For example, have it parse out and identify the core action(s) expressed—essentially “annotating” the request with its intended operations. You can then have a follow‐up step that validates whether the extracted intent is in scope. This deconstruction can help prevent misinterpretations, such as mixing an allowed operation with an unrelated “joke.”\n\n2. Define operational boundaries clearly in your prompt instructions. Consider “hard-coding” the allowed set of actions and tell the model, “If a user request contains any operations outside of {delete, update, create, …}, ignore them or return an error.” By isolating the allowed actions, you give the model a clear framework that can reduce hallucinatory behavior.\n\n3. Provide multiple examples with annotated expected responses. When you include edge cases—like informal phrases (“kinda delete this channel”) versus multi-intent inputs (“create a channel and tell me a joke”)—the model may pick up on the nuance of separating the valid part from the extraneous parts, or it can be prompted to ask clarifying questions when it’s not entirely sure.\n\n4. Leverage clarifying questions or confidence thresholds. For ambiguous messages, one strategy is to have the gatekeeper either return a “need clarification” message or at least mark low-confidence cases for manual review. This way, you avoid outright rejection of legitimate but informal requests while still not processing ambiguous instructions directly to your expensive model.\n\n5. Consider hybrid strategies mixing rule-based filtering with LLM-based validation. Sometimes a lightweight regex or keyword filter can catch obviously out-of-scope phrases. Then, the LLM can operate on a pre-processed, “cleaned” version of the input where phrases that could lead to hallucination have been stripped out or flagged.\n\n6. Iterate on prompt design. Since LLM responses are quite sensitive to the phrasing, you may need to experiment with prompt scaffolds. For instance, instruct the assistant with something like, “Your task is to identify one of the following approved operations: …; if there is additional text beyond the operation that isn’t in the approved list, ignore it or flag the request.” Adjust the tone and specificity until you see a balance.\n\n7. Finally, test with a wide range of colloquial and complex multi-intent inputs to see how the model performs. The more diverse examples you have, the better you can fine-tune the balance. Consider also running A/B tests or human-in-the-loop evaluations to verify that valid actions don’t get mistakenly rejected.\n\nEach of these approaches comes with its own trade-offs in complexity and reliability, but together they might give you a path forward. It sounds like you’re very close to a workable solution, and with iterative testing and refinement you should find a “sweet spot” for your application. \n\nHope these ideas help spark some useful directions in your investigation!",

Clear, Layered Instructions**\n- Be explicit about what the LLM should consider ‘in-scope’ versus ‘out-of-scope’. For example:  \n“In your response, ONLY validate if the user request matches a known, supported action: [list actions]. If the request is ambiguous or contains multiple actions, reject it.”\n- You can add: “Do NOT try to interpret or rephrase unclear requests. When in doubt, reject.”\n\n**2. Examples Are Key**\n- Provide positive and negative examples in your prompt, including edge cases. E.g.:\n    - Accept: \"delete this channel\", \"please remove the channel\", \"kinda delete this channel\"\n    - Reject: \"create a channel and tell me a joke\", \"do something fun\"\n- Make sure to include some “colloquial” or imprecise but valid requests in your positive examples.\n\n**3. Step-by-Step Reasoning**\n- Encourage the LLM to explicitly parse intent first, then validate. E.g.:  \n“First, identify the main action in the request. If it matches a supported action exactly, accept. If not, reject.”  \nThis helps avoid hallucinations or multi-intent acceptance.\n\n**4. Conservative Defaults**\n- When in doubt, bias toward rejection. It’s safer to make the user rephrase than to let an out-of-scope command through.\n\n**5. Iterative Prompting**\n- If time allows, consider a two-step approach:  \n    1. First prompt: “What is the main action the user wants?”  \n    2. Second prompt: “Is this action allowed?”  \n- This modularity can reduce hallucinations, but may be too slow/complex for your immediate deadline.\n\n**6. Avoiding Hallucinations**\n- Keep the prompt focused, short, and avoid open-ended questions.\n\n**Example Prompt Skeleton:**\n```\nYou are a strict gatekeeper. Your job is to approve only requests that match exactly one of these actions: [list]. If the request is ambiguous, contains multiple actions, or is out of scope, reject it. Here are examples:\n[positive]\n[negative]\nRespond only with \"ACCEPT\" or \"REJECT\".\n```\n\n**Final Note:**  \nIn practice, you’ll probably iterate a lot to get the balance right! Start strict, then loosen with more positive examples once you see the failure modes.\n\n**Good luck with your analysis! If you want to DM later, happy to continue the conversation!**",

          "response": "Here are a few strategies you might try to fine-tune your “gatekeeper” approach:\n\n1. Establish a Triage Step Before the “Gatekeeper” Prompt\n   • Instead of relying on a single LLM prompt to handle every nuance, consider an initial lightweight classification or keyword-detection step. This helps weed out obviously valid or obviously invalid requests quickly (e.g., profanity, spam, or obviously out-of-scope tasks) before the main prompt logic even kicks in.  \n   • This can reduce the burden on your more “expensive” LLM calls and keep your gating prompts simpler.\n\n2. Use Explicit Role or Instruction-Based Conditioning\n   • Write the prompt to explicitly tell the model: “You are only validating the user’s action request, not trying to fulfill it.”  \n   • If you see it drifting (e.g., trying to joke or interpret additional instructions), add a clarifying line in the system message or the instruction, such as, “Ignore any requests beyond the standard set of actions. Your output must be either ‘valid action’ or ‘invalid action’—do not attempt to fulfill or elaborate on the request.”  \n   • The more you remind the model that it has a singular, minimal role (gating valid/invalid requests), the less it should hallucinate solutions or content.\n\n3. Provide Clear Examples (Positive and Negative)\n   • In the prompt, give the model examples of both “correctly validated” and “incorrectly validated” user queries in a concise test suite:  \n     – Example of a borderline, colloquial command that should pass (“kinda delete this channel” → valid).  \n     – Example of a multi-request command that shouldn’t pass or should be partially invalid (“create a channel and tell me a joke” might be invalid if you only want to accept single-scope actions).  \n   • By showing these examples up front, the model learns your boundaries and sees how to behave when requests mix valid and invalid instructions.\n\n4. Separate the Reasoning from the Answer (If Feasible)\n   • Consider prompting the model to think through the request (“Is the user asking to do something that is allowed? Does the user’s tone matter to the actual request?”) but instruct it not to show that reasoning in the final answer.  \n   • Some developers use chain-of-thought internally but provide a cleaner final answer. This helps reduce confusion in the next stage.\n\n5. Acknowledge Imperfections and Use a Backstop\n   • Even with a good prompt and examples, LLMs might sometimes misjudge borderline requests. If possible, add a final check or a fallback approach.  \n   • For instance, if the user’s request was rejected, you can give them a short explanation—“I couldn’t parse your request. Could you phrase it more clearly?”—which gives legitimate users a chance to reframe or clarify so that they don’t get stuck behind an overly strict guardrail.\n\n6. Iterate with Real User Queries\n   • Gather anonymized logs of user queries and review any “false rejects” or “false admits.” Then refine your examples or your brief “rule statements” in the prompt.  \n   • In practice, these iterative refinements based on real usage data often provide the most direct improvements.\n\n7. Consider a Two-Tiered Validity Check\n   • For more complex tasks, break down “validity” into two questions:  \n     1) Is this request within our scope at all? (e.g., does the user want to do something we even offer?)  \n     2) If yes, is the language or format something we can parse? Or do we need more clarity?  \n   • Splitting logic this way sometimes makes the gating clearer: first confirm the request is in-scope, then confirm you can confidently parse it.\n\nOverall, the core principle is to keep your “gatekeeper” prompt narrowly focused—only classify or filter rather than fulfill—and to ground it with just enough examples that it can handle variations in tone and phrasing. Then, rely on iterative reviews of real-world usage to keep fine-tuning. Good luck with your system!",

          "response": "It sounds like you’re facing one of the classic challenges in LLM application design—achieving a sensible balance between interpretive flexibility (to handle natural, colloquial language) and strict control (to prevent out-of-scope or unsafe actions).\n\nHere are some strategies that might help you brainstorm ways to refine your gatekeeper prompt:\n\n1. Two-Stage Approach:  \n • First Stage: Use a light, general-purpose parser/intent extractor that focuses solely on “what the user wants to do” without trying to execute actions. For example, have the LLM output a structured intent (like “delete channel” or “create channel”) and any parameters.  \n • Second Stage: Validate the intent against a whitelist of allowable operations. If the intent is unknown or includes additional requests (like “joke”), you can either safely default to denying or have a separate, more specialized flow.\n\n2. Contextual Examples:  \n • Provide concrete examples in the prompt that illustrate borderline cases. For instance, show that “kinda delete this channel” should be interpreted as a delete intent, while “delete this channel and then tell me a joke” clearly triggers a split intent where only the deletion is in-scope.  \n • Emphasize to the model that the task is to ignore any extra requests outside the core action.\n\n3. Chain-of-Thought Prompts:  \n • Encourage the model to “think aloud” internally. In other words, instruct it to first list the possible intents it perceives and then select the one that matches the allowed rubric. Even if you don’t share the chain-of-thought with subsequent systems, it might better align the model’s internal reasoning.  \n • This internal decomposition can help disambiguate cases where natural language is too relaxed.\n\n4. Keyword and Intent Mapping:  \n • Instead of letting the model freeform interpret the natural language, you might prompt it to map inputs into a “controlled vocabulary” of operations.  \n • For example, instruct it: “Identify the core command as one option from this list: [delete, create, update], and list any extra components as ‘annotations’ that should be ignored.”  \n • You can then validate strictly against the allowed commands.\n\n5. Fallback or Clarification Strategy:  \n • For ambiguous requests that might include extra, unsafe instructions or out-of-scope parts (e.g., “delete and tell me a joke”), consider building in a fallback where the system asks for clarification or simply dismisses the additional instruction.  \n • For example, “I recognized you want to delete a channel. Would you like to proceed with that action only?” This can both improve safety and ensure clarity.\n\n6. Test with a Variety of Inputs:  \n • Since natural language is so varied, it can help to collect a corpus of real user queries—both the clear and borderline cases—and iterate on the prompt based on observed failures.  \n • Even if you can’t allow the LLM to handle the full request, you get feedback on where it misclassifies intentions.\n\n7. External Validation:  \n • If possible, consider having a small external classifier or rule-based module assist in flagging requests that include multiple intents. This way the LLM can focus on interpreting the primary action without needing to “worry” about ignoring the rest.\n\nUltimately, you’re designing a sort of “intent aggregator” and “intent filter.” You want it to be forgiving of natural phrasing (to allow for colloquial expressions) but also sufficiently constrained to ignore or separate out-of-scope additions.  \n  \nWhile there isn’t a one-size-fits-all answer, combining structured output formats with chain-of-thought reasoning and fallback clarification pathways seems to be a promising direction. This allows you to cater to the messy nature of user language while keeping the actionable parts safe and controlled.\n\nHope this helps spark some ideas before your analysis meeting. Good luck!",

Here are some strategic thoughts and prompting approaches you might consider (not code, just frameworks and ideas):\n\n**1. Explicit Task Framing**\nMake the prompt super explicit about what constitutes a \"valid\" request, but also provide examples of both borderline and colloquial phrasing. Instead of just describing, give positive/negative examples (few-shot approach). E.g.:\n> Accept requests to **delete a channel** even if phrased casually (e.g., \"kinda delete this channel\"), but ignore or reject any unrelated requests (e.g., \"tell me a joke\").\n\n**2. Separation of Concerns**\nRather than a single yes/no filter, have the LLM first extract the core action/intent, then validate that. So:\n- Step 1: \"What is the user trying to do?\" (intent classification)\n- Step 2: \"Is this action allowed?\"\n\nSometimes splitting these steps reduces hallucinations and makes handling colloquial input easier.\n\n**3. Single-Intent Enforcement**\nMake the LLM explicitly reject multi-intent or compound requests. In your prompt, say:\n> If the user asks for more than one thing, reject the request and ask them to rephrase with a single action.\n\n**4. Use of Output Structure**\nAsk the LLM to respond in a structured format, e.g.:\n```\n{\n  \"valid\": true/false,\n  \"action\": \"delete_channel\",\n  \"reason\": \"Request includes only a supported action, phrased colloquially.\"\n}\n```\nThis makes downstream processing more robust and reduces ambiguity.\n\n**5. Edge Case Emphasis**\nIn your prompt, highlight that user phrasing may be informal and that the model should err on the side of permissiveness _for in-scope actions_, but never attempt to invent or combine actions that aren’t supported.\n\n**6. Iterative Prompt Testing**\nIteratively test your prompt with a challenging, diverse set of user requests (both in-scope and out-of-scope, plus multi-intent), and refine based on failure points.\n\n**7. Consider Hybrid Approaches**\nIf the LLM struggles with colloquial intent mapping, consider a lightweight intent classifier (regex, keyword matcher) before the LLM to catch obvious cases, reducing the burden on the LLM filter.\n\n---\n\n**Summary of Strategy:**  \n- Be explicit about what is and isn’t valid, with examples.\n- Separate intent recognition from permissioning if possible.\n- Enforce single actions.\n- Use structured outputs.\n- Regularly test with edge cases.\n- Consider hybrid models for cheap/fast pre-filtering.\n\n---\n\nHappy to chat more if you want to DM or elaborate here—this is a nuanced, iterative problem that’s as much about prompt engineering as system design.

          "response": "Here are a few strategies that might help strike the balance between “overly strict” and “too flexible”:\n\n1) Chain-of-thought “under the hood”:  \n   • Let the gatekeeper use an internal reasoning process to determine whether an action is valid, but only return a yes/no decision (or a short explanation) to your application.  \n   • By separating its private reasoning from the user-facing response, you can encourage more nuanced interpretations without risking your gatekeeper generating unhelpful or confusing text.  \n\n2) Tiered classification or tagging:  \n   • Instead of asking the gatekeeper model to parse the entire request in one go, break down the validation process into smaller steps or tags (e.g., category determination, action check, domain check).  \n   • Each tag step can be tuned with example prompts or specific instructions. For instance:  \n     – Step 1: “Is the request about channel management? About jokes? Something else?”  \n     – Step 2: “Does the request require admin privileges? Is it a purely informational request?”  \n\n3) Few-shot or better-shot examples:  \n   • Provide the gatekeeper with illustrative examples of borderline or colloquial requests (like “kinda delete this channel” or “looootsa jokes please”). Show how these should be interpreted.  \n   • Use both positive (“this request was allowed”) and negative (“this request was filtered”) examples.  \n   • Make sure to include “ambiguous but valid” cases as well as “seemingly valid but out-of-scope” cases.  \n\n4) Highlight the difference between “understand and interpret” vs. “carry out” in the prompt:  \n   • Emphasize in the gatekeeper’s prompt that its job is to interpret the user’s intent in natural language, not to solve or refine the request. This can reduce confusion around side tasks (like “tell me a joke”).  \n   • For example: “You are a gatekeeper. You do not carry out any action. You only confirm whether the user’s request is valid and in scope, or not.”  \n\n5) Structured outputs or “validation schemas”:  \n   • When the gatekeeper responds, have it output information in a structured format, such as JSON, with fields like { isValid: true/false, reason: “explanation”, recognizedAction: “delete channel” }.  \n   • Relying on a structured approach forces the model to parse the user request in a more systematic way, which can reduce hallucinations.  \n\n6) Confidence calibration or fallback:  \n   • If the gatekeeper is uncertain (e.g., the user’s request has multiple plausible interpretations), have it return an “unsure” flag or fallback to a safe default (like requesting more clarification).  \n   • This can be more robust than forcing a binary yes/no when the model truly is uncertain.  \n\n7) Iterate with real user data and “near misses”:  \n   • Gather examples of real queries that your gatekeeper gets wrong. Then, add these examples (with desired outcomes) back into your prompt or few-shot examples.  \n   • Over time, you’ll accumulate a small “corpus of confusion” that helps refine the guardrail logic.  \n\nAll of these approaches revolve around carving out clear roles for the gatekeeper, providing it with well-defined tasks (classification, interpretation, or triage), and giving it carefully selected examples that show how to handle borderline language or out-of-scope requests. If you keep iterating with actual usage logs, you can gradually minimize the false negatives (legitimate requests that get rejected) and false positives (invalid requests that slip through).  \n\nHope that helps—happy to chat more if you’re still weighing different tactics!

Two-stage processing:  \n • Use a preliminary “gatekeeper” prompt that’s intentionally very conservative. This prompt flags potentially ambiguous inputs for further review rather than outright rejection.  \n • If the input passes this conservative check, send it to a second pass with a more nuanced or detailed prompt that can handle colloquial nuances and resolve ambiguities before finally dispatching to your expensive model.\n\n2. Explicit, structured instructions:  \n • Frame the prompt to ask the gatekeeper to extract an \"intent\" from the input. For instance, instruct it to produce a JSON structure with keys like \"action\" and \"parameters.\"  \n • This structured extraction can help filter inputs that combine multiple requests (like “create a channel and tell me a joke”).  \n • You might also specify that if multiple intents are present, only the primary or relevant one should be returned, or have a special flag indicating a multi-part request that needs additional handling.\n\n3. Intent recognition with predefined mappings:  \n • Instead of processing freeform inputs directly, have the gatekeeper match user input against a list of acceptable commands or action abstractions.  \n • Providing examples of acceptable variations in the prompt (“kinda delete this channel” → delete channel) can help the model learn to normalize colloquial language to your supported actions.\n\n4. Use meta-prompting and constraints:  \n • In the prompt, advise the LLM to avoid “hallucinating” or processing parts of the request that fall outside its immediate scope.  \n • For example, include a directive along the lines of, “If a request contains multiple instructions or ambiguous language, only choose the one action that best corresponds to one of the allowed operations. Don’t provide additional commentary or process requests outside these operations.”\n\n5. Iterative refinement and feedback:  \n • Test your prompts with a wide variety of inputs (both ideal and edge cases) and refine based on actual outputs.  \n • It might help to log ambiguous cases and analyze what cues lead the gatekeeper to either over-reject valid inputs or inadvertently process unsupported ones.\n\n6. Incorporate a “fallback” mechanism:  \n • If the gatekeeper isn’t certain (e.g., its confidence is below a predefined threshold), it can flag the request as ambiguous and either ask a clarifying question or send it to a human operator or a more robust clarification routine before incurring the cost of the powerful model.\n\nUltimately, the challenge is teaching the model the nuance of human language while keeping the decision-making process crisp. Experiment with a combination of explicit examples, structured output requirements (like JSON), and a hierarchy of processing stages. Since you’re not asking for code but rather discussion on strategy, it might also help to look at multi-agent frameworks where one “agent” is tasked solely with normalization and intent extraction, while another handles disambiguation.\n\nWould love to know if any of these suggestions resonate or if there’s a particular part of the problem that’s giving you the most trouble.

          "response": "Hello! I'd be happy to provide some insights based on my experience in working with large language models (LLMs) and building robust systems that leverage them.\n\nThe challenge you're facing is a common one when using LLMs as gatekeepers or filters for more powerful models. Striking the right balance between flexibility and strictness is crucial to ensure reliable and safe performance.\n\nHere are a few suggestions and strategies you could consider:\n\n1. **Prompt Engineering**: Spend time carefully crafting and iterating on your prompt. Experiment with different approaches, such as:\n   - Providing clear instructions and guidelines on the types of requests the model should validate.\n   - Incorporating examples of valid and invalid requests to help the model learn the desired behavior.\n   - Incorporating prompts that encourage the model to be cautious and err on the side of safety when unsure about a request.\n\n2. **Prompt Decomposition**: Instead of a single, monolithic prompt, consider breaking down the validation process into multiple steps or sub-prompts. For example:\n   - Step 1: Understand the intent of the user's request.\n   - Step 2: Validate that the intent is within the scope of supported actions.\n   - Step 3: Validate the parameters or details of the request.\n   - Step 4: Provide a final assessment of the request's validity.\n\n   This modular approach can help the model focus on specific aspects of the validation process and make more informed decisions.\n\n3. **Leveraging Domain Knowledge**: Incorporate domain-specific information or constraints into your prompts. This can help the model better understand the context and boundaries of the supported actions, reducing the risk of hallucinations or out-of-scope responses.\n\n4. **Iterative Refinement**: Continuously monitor the performance of your gatekeeper model and gather feedback from users. Use this information to refine your prompts, adjust the model's behavior, and improve the overall system.\n\n5. **Supplementary Techniques**: Consider incorporating additional techniques to enhance the reliability and safety of your system, such as:\n   - Prompt chaining: Using multiple models in a sequence to validate different aspects of the request.\n   - Confidence thresholds: Rejecting requests if the model's confidence in the validation is below a certain threshold.\n   - Anomaly detection: Monitoring for unusual or unexpected responses that may indicate a problem.\n\nThe key is to strike a balance between flexibility and strictness, while also being proactive about monitoring and iteratively improving your system. It's a challenging task, but with careful design and experimentation, you can build a robust and reliable gatekeeper LLM.\n\nI'd be happy to discuss this further and share more insights based on my experience.

This is a really common and tricky problem in LLM system design.\n\nHere are a few strategic approaches that often work well for this type of validation layer:\n\n**Intent Extraction + Scope Checking**\nInstead of trying to do everything in one prompt, consider a two-step approach:\n1. Extract the core intent(s) from colloquial language\n2. Check if those intents fall within your allowed scope\n\n**Explicit Examples Strategy**\nBuild your prompt with clear positive/negative examples that cover edge cases like:\n- Colloquial language that should pass\n- Multi-intent requests and how to handle them\n- Out-of-scope requests that should fail\n\n**Confidence Scoring**\nHave the gatekeeper return a confidence score along with its decision. This lets you tune the threshold and handle edge cases differently (maybe route uncertain cases to human review or a more sophisticated validator).\n\n**Domain-Specific Validation**\nIf you have a defined set of valid actions, consider having the LLM map requests to specific action categories rather than doing open-ended validation.\n\nThe \"create channel and tell joke\" problem is particularly interesting - you might want the gatekeeper to identify and separate multiple intents, then validate each independently.\n\nWhat's your current prompt structure like? Are you using a classification approach or more of a reasoning-based validation?",

Define \"valid request\" with clarity and examples.**  \nInstruct the gatekeeper LLM not just with definitions, but with a diverse set of positive and negative examples, especially covering the \"gray area\" (e.g., colloquial phrasings, multi-intent requests). For example:\n\n- \"delete this channel\" → valid  \n- \"kinda delete this channel\" → valid  \n- \"create a channel and tell me a joke\" → valid (only if 'create a channel' is valid; otherwise, flag as multi-intent or out of scope)\n\n**2. Ask for explicit intent parsing, not just yes/no validation.**  \nInstead of \"is this a valid request?\", prompt the LLM to extract the core intent(s) and then compare those to your list of allowed actions. This helps with both colloquial phrasing and multi-intent detection.\n\n**3. Add precedence rules for multiple intents.**  \nGuide the model to reject or flag requests that combine in-scope and out-of-scope actions, e.g., “If the request contains more than one action or includes an out-of-scope action, flag for review.”\n\n**4. Use step-wise reasoning.**  \nPrompt the gatekeeper to \"think step by step,\" e.g.,  \na. Identify the core intent(s).  \nb. Check if all intents are in allowed actions.  \nc. Approve only if all are in scope and phrased as a request.\n\n**5. Consider fallback mechanisms.**  \nIf unsure, have the gatekeeper escalate to a secondary, more robust check, or ask the user for clarification, rather than a hard reject.\n\n**6. Continuous prompt tuning and log review.**  \nRegularly review rejected and accepted cases, especially edge cases, and tune your prompt and examples accordingly.\n\n**7. (Optional) Use structured outputs.**  \nHave the gatekeeper return a structured JSON with fields like:  \n- intent(s) detected  \n- validity (yes/no)  \n- reason/explanation  \n- confidence score (if model supports it)\n\nThis helps with downstream handling and error analysis.\n\n**In summary:**  \nYou’re not alone in this challenge! It’s an iterative process of prompt design, example curation, and regular error analysis. The most robust systems often combine explicit instructions, diverse examples, and layered checks. Also, don’t be afraid to let the gatekeeper err on the side of “ask the user for clarification” rather than a hard fail or risky accept—this can be a user-friendly and safe fallback.\n\nHappy to chat further if you want to dig deeper into any of these strategies!",

          "response": "Here are a few strategies and prompting considerations I’ve seen work in similar “gatekeeper” scenarios:\n\n1) Structure your prompt around identifying valid vs. invalid (or out-of-scope) requests, not around actually performing the request.  \n   • Often, the gatekeeper can simply return a structured answer like “valid / invalid” plus “extracted action = delete_channel” (or whatever you need).  \n   • Explicitly tell it that it should not attempt to fulfill or elaborate on the request.  \n\n2) Teach the gatekeeper to separate the user’s input into sub-requests (like “create a channel” vs. “tell me a joke”) and evaluate each.  \n   • For instance, you might say: “Break down the request into parts. For each part, decide whether it’s within scope. If a part is valid, return it in structured form; if it’s out of scope, flag it as such.”  \n   • This approach reduces hallucination because the filter’s only job is to parse and label, not to respond with the final answer.  \n\n3) Provide “borderline” examples in a few-shot prompt.  \n   • If you have real logs or made-up examples where the user uses slang (“kinda,” “pls,” “can u …?”), show how you interpret them as a valid action.  \n   • Also include examples where the request is partially or completely out of scope (“tell me a story,” or entirely irrelevant queries).  \n   • The model will learn the difference between a colloquial rephrase and an actual out-of-scope request.  \n\n4) Use role-based instructions and policy prompts.  \n   • For example: “You are a gatekeeper system. Your only job is to validate whether the request is one of [allowed actions] or not. If it is, rewrite it in canonical form (e.g., ‘delete_channel’), otherwise output ‘invalid_request.’”  \n   • Emphasize that the gatekeeper is NOT to expand, be creative, or interpret beyond your enumerated set of actions.  \n\n5) Consider a two-step approach within your gatekeeper prompt.  \n   • First: “Restate the user request in plain terms. If it’s unclear, try to clarify minimally.”  \n   • Second: “Based on that restatement, decide if it matches known valid actions.”  \n   • This can help the model focus on conversion first, then classification, rather than mixing them into one step.  \n\n6) Give the model a “refusal policy” or “certainty threshold.”  \n   • If the request is partially incomprehensible, have it request clarification or default to “invalid_request.”  \n   • If it’s mostly comprehensible and partially valid, have it accept the valid part and ignore or flag the out-of-scope portion, depending on your needs.\n\nThe big takeaway is to explicitly confine the gatekeeper’s responsibilities to classification, rewriting, and gating. The more you ask it to “chat” or “improve language,” the more likely it is to drift outside scope, especially for multi-part user queries. The best results usually come when you feed the gatekeeper a very rigid set of instructions plus a handful of carefully chosen examples that reflect your real borderline cases. \n\nHopefully that helps—happy to chat more if you have follow-up questions!",

You want to know:\n\n**What is the computational complexity of algorithm A?**\n\n### 1. **Understanding Algorithm A**\n\n- Input: A user request in natural language (a string).\n- Step 1: The request is processed by a gatekeeper LLM (a call to a language model) to check if the request is valid and in scope.\n- Step 2: If valid, the request is forwarded to a more powerful model; otherwise, it is rejected.\n\n### 2. **What is \"Computational Complexity\"?**\n\nThis usually refers to how the time/resources required by an algorithm scale with the input size, often denoted as O(f(n)), where n is input size.\n\n### 3. **Complexity of LLM Inference**\n\nThe bottleneck is the LLM call. For large language models (LLMs), the computational cost to process an input is generally proportional to:\n\n- The number of tokens in the input (`n`)\n- The number of model parameters (`P`)\n- Any output tokens generated (not relevant if only classifying/filtering)\n\nFor a gatekeeper LLM that just validates input, the LLM typically does one forward pass to produce a classification or simple response.\n\n**LLM inference cost:**  \nFor a transformer-based LLM, inference time is:\n\n- O(P × n²) for self-attention per layer (P: number of parameters, n: sequence length), but in practice, the model is fixed, and n is usually small (a single sentence/request).\n\nFor practical purposes and fixed model size, the complexity is **linear in the input size** (number of tokens):\n\n- **O(n)**, where n = length of the user request in tokens.\n\n### 4. **Other Steps**\n\n- Filtering, routing, and any post-processing (like passing to the next model) are negligible compared to the LLM call.\n\n### 5. **Overall Complexity**\n\n- **Time Complexity:** If the gatekeeper LLM is treated as a black box, the time complexity is **O(n)** per request, where n is the input length in tokens.\n- **Space Complexity:** Also O(n) for storing the input, plus O(P) for the model, but the model is loaded once and reused.\n\n### 6. **If Batch Processing**\n\nIf you process B requests at once, total cost is O(Bn), but each request is still O(n).\n\n---\n\n## **Summary Table**\n\n| Step                 | Complexity  |\n|----------------------|-------------|\n| LLM Gatekeeper call  | O(n)        |\n| Post-processing      | O(1)        |\n| Total (per request)  | O(n)        |\n\n**Where n is the length of the user request (in tokens).**\n\n---\n\n## **Conclusion**\n\n**Algorithm A has a computational complexity of O(n) per request, where n is the number of tokens in the user's input.** The dominant cost is the LLM inference call, which (for a fixed model) is linear in input size.\n\nLet me know if you want more detail about the actual hardware/latency/runtime considerations, or if you meant something different by \"computational complexity\"!",

A “gatekeeper” pass on the user’s natural-language request to decide whether the request is valid or should be rejected.  \n2. If valid, a second pass by a more powerful model to fulfill the request.\n\nFrom a traditional algorithmic standpoint:\n\n• Each LLM inference can be viewed as running a transformer-based model with a complexity that is often approximated as O(L² × H), where L is the input sequence length (in tokens) and H is a function of the model’s hidden dimension and layer count.  \n• Algorithm A, therefore, consists of one or two O(L² × H) operations per request—one for the gatekeeper check, and a possible second for the actual request response.  \n\nHence, if we let n = L (the token length of the user input) and treat H as a constant characteristic of the fixed model sizes, the total time per request is essentially O(n²). So in big-O terms, the overall computational complexity of A for a single user request is O(n²).  \n\nIf one cares about large H-scaling (comparing models of vastly different sizes), then the complexity can also be seen as O(n² × H) for each pass. But in most practical discussions, one treats the model size as fixed, leading to a simplified O(n²) measure for each inference.",

Because most of the work is done by the LLM’s internal processing, analyzing A’s computational complexity involves two aspects:\n\n1. Outside the LLM call, A takes a fixed natural‑language prompt (plus the user's input) and submits it. That “glue” logic is essentially constant‑time or O(1) with respect to the size of the input (assuming typical user requests are short and the prompt is constant).\n\n2. The heavy lifting is done inside the LLM. Most transformer‑based models (such as those used as LLMs) compute self‑attention over the entire token sequence. In a transformer layer, self‑attention is typically computed in O(n²) time relative to the number n of tokens (since each token’s attention is computed with respect to every other token). If the prompt and user input together have n tokens and there are L layers, then roughly speaking each layer contributes O(n²) work, for a total of about O(L · n²). (Sometimes you see versions described as O(n²) per layer with additional linear components, but the quadratic term is the dominant factor when n grows.)\n\nIn practice, however, the input sizes here are small (a few dozen tokens at most for typical requests), so while the theoretical computational complexity for the LLM call is quadratic in the length of the token sequence, you’re effectively operating in a “constant‑time” scenario from a high‑level application perspective.\n\nTo summarize:\n• The “algorithm” A outside the LLM call runs in constant time, O(1).\n• The LLM call itself (using a transformer backbone) generally has a complexity of O(n²) in terms of token length.\n• Because typical prompts and user inputs are very short, the overall process behaves like a constant‑time operation for practical purposes, though formally it scales quadratically with token count.\n\nSo, the primary computational cost is in the LLM’s self‑attention mechanism, meaning A’s cost is dominated by the O(n²) behavior with respect to the number of processed tokens.",

Operations that can be counted or measured\n\nIf you intended to ask about the computational complexity of the LLM gatekeeper system described in the post, I could discuss that conceptually:\n\n- **Gatekeeper LLM call**: O(n) where n is input token length, plus model-specific constants\n- **Main LLM call**: O(m) where m is the processed request length\n- **Overall system**: O(n + m) for successful requests, O(n) for filtered requests\n\nBut without a formal algorithm specification, I cannot provide a rigorous complexity analysis.\n\nCould you clarify what specific algorithm you'd like me to analyze, or rephrase your question if you meant something different?",

Finding that sweet spot between strictness and flexibility is definitely tricky—especially when user language is unpredictable. \\n\\nA couple of strategic ideas you might consider (not code, just broad strokes):\\n\\n1. Multi-phase Filtering: Sometimes, layering a lightweight intent parser/classifier (even non-LLM) before the LLM filter helps. This can weed out obviously out-of-domain or malformed requests, letting your LLM filter focus on the gray areas.\\n\\n2. Prompt Framing: Instead of asking the gatekeeper LLM to make a binary valid/invalid call, you might ask it to extract the intended action(s) and flag ambiguous/compound requests. For example, \\\"Does this request contain only one supported action? If not, summarize and flag the extras.\\\"\\n\\n3. Feedback Loop: Log rejections and near-misses, and periodically review where the filter is too harsh or too lax. This helps you iteratively tune prompts and maybe create a few fallback prompt variants for edge cases.\\n\\n4. User Clarification: For ambiguous or borderline user input, consider having the gatekeeper respond with a clarifying question rather than a hard reject. This can improve both safety and UX.\\n\\nHappy to chat more if you want to DM—this is a nuanced challenge and there are a lot of fun prompt engineering and UX tradeoffs involved!\\n\\nBest of luck!\",\n  \"type\": \"data\"\n}",

For instance, you can have a lightweight classifier that detects the intended action (e.g., “delete,” “create,” “tell a joke,” etc.)—without yet deciding whether to allow or block—then feed that classified request into your gatekeeper with a simpler, more tightly scoped prompt.\\n\\nThe trick is to minimize ‘guessing’ or ‘filling in’ from the gatekeeper model. If the user request includes extraneous details, you might instruct the gatekeeper to focus on the recognized action and ignore non-action content. That way, unsolicited expansions (like telling a joke) get separated from the core request, so you won’t fail on multi-intent prompts.\\n\\nAdditionally, you can maintain a list of allowed or disallowed actions—and if the chosen action is out of scope, the gatekeeper can reject it outright. For borderline cases (where the wording is ambiguous), you can auto-trigger a quick clarifying question before finalizing the pass/fail decision.

This gatekeeper is designed to quickly and inexpensively filter out invalid, ambiguous, or out-of-scope queries before engaging a more powerful (and costly) downstream model for full task execution.\n\nThe primary responsibilities of the gatekeeper LLM are:\n\n\\begin{itemize}\n    \\item \\textbf{Intent Recognition:} The model analyzes the user input to detect whether the request matches a set of supported actions (e.g., \"delete channel,\" \"create channel\").\n    \\item \\textbf{Request Validation:} It checks that the request is clear, actionable, and does not contain multiple or conflicting intents (e.g., \"create a channel and tell me a joke\" would be flagged as invalid).\n    \\item \\textbf{Colloquial Understanding:} The gatekeeper is tuned to interpret common variations and informal language, accepting requests that convey valid intent even if phrased imprecisely (e.g., \"kinda delete this channel\").\n    \\item \\textbf{Safety Filtering:} It rejects requests that are out of scope or potentially unsafe, providing an additional layer of guardrails before any high-privilege action is considered.\n\\end{itemize}\n\nBy offloading initial validation to the gatekeeper, the system achieves significant cost savings and improved robustness. Only requests that are deemed valid and within scope are forwarded to the more capable LLM, which then performs the requested action or generates the appropriate response.\n\nThis approach allows us to strike a balance between safety, flexibility, and efficiency in processing natural language user requests.\n\n---\n\nLet me know if you need this adjusted for a different audience, or want to include more details about specific prompting strategies!",

          "response": "It can definitely be tricky to strike a balance between being too literal (and potentially rejecting everything that doesn’t match a rigid template) and being too permissive (and letting the model drift or hallucinate beyond the allowed scope).\n\nHere are a few strategies I’ve seen people use successfully:\n\n1. Structure the “gatekeeper” prompt around an explicit taxonomy of actions or intents.  \n   – For example, list out categories like “Create,” “Delete,” “Modify,” and “Out of scope.” The LLM only has to decide (1) which category fits best and (2) whether the request has enough clarity or if more info is needed.  \n   – Having a clear ontology might help steer the model away from trying to do extra tasks, like telling jokes if it’s only supposed to confirm an action on a resource.\n\n2. Split the request handling into multiple steps if you suspect the user’s request may be compound or ambiguous.  \n   – One pass (the cheaper gatekeeper pass) can parse or classify each sub-request, discarding or flagging anything that’s not valid.  \n   – A second pass (the more powerful or expensive model) only handles the confirmed scope.  \n   – If the user said, “Create a channel and tell me a joke,” the first pass could break it into two separate requests: “create a channel” (valid) and “tell me a joke” (likely not relevant). It can either discard the second or return an error indicating the system only supports creation commands.\n\n3. Use clarifying questions.  \n   – If the input is “kinda delete this channel,” the system can respond, “Just to confirm, do you want to delete the channel?” which keeps it from outright rejecting the request due to informal phrasing.\n\n4. Explicitly instruct the gatekeeper model on what it is not allowed to do.  \n   – Sometimes a separate “negative list” (e.g., “do not attempt to be witty” or “do not attempt to answer questions unrelated to verifying channel actions”) helps keep it on-task.\n\n5. Provide a reference format for valid actions.  \n   – If there’s a known set of actions (e.g., “create,” “delete,” “rename,” etc.), providing examples—both valid and invalid—often helps the model interpret informal language in the correct category.  \n   – For instance, show it:  \n       “Delete the channel” → VALID (maps to “delete action”)  \n       “nuke this whole thing plz” → LIKELY VALID (informal but means “delete action”)  \n       “tell me a story” → OUT OF SCOPE  \n\n6. Consider confidence scoring or “certainty thresholds.”  \n   – If the gatekeeper is uncertain, you can either ask the user to clarify or route the request to a fallback method (like a human check or a safer modeling approach).\n\nIn practice, it’s often an iterative process: you collect real user inputs, see where the gatekeeper misclassifies them, and refine the prompt or approach over time. A big help is to keep the gatekeeper’s job as narrow and clearly defined as possible—so it’s not tempted to do more than classify or confirm. If you keep building out small, curated examples of borderline or tricky requests, the model usually gets better at interpreting them in context over time.\n\nGood luck! It sounds like you’re almost there, and the key is often just refining your categories, clarifying instructions, and letting users know when the system is unsure and needs more detail.",

          "response": "Here are some thoughts on striking the balance:\n\n1. Use a hierarchical or two-stage approach. One idea is to have an initial “intent classification” model that’s set up to ask, “Does this request contain a valid action in our supported domain?” In the second stage, you can then “clean” or “normalize” the intent before passing it to the expensive model. This separation lets you tailor each prompt to the specific task—one can be more forgiving in parsing language while the other focuses on safety.\n\n2. Provide clear examples in your prompt. One common strategy is to include a few few-shot examples that illustrate colloquial phrasing for valid actions (“kinda delete this channel”) and examples that contain extraneous requests (“create a channel and tell me a joke”) that need to be interpreted carefully. This helps guide the model to learn what to accept and what to ignore or flag.\n\n3. Consider “action extraction” vs. “full request validation.” One trick is to instruct the model to first extract the primary action (and parameters) and then look for tokens or phrases that indicate secondary or extraneous instructions. For example, “If you detect multiple requests or actions, only validate the primary action and ignore additional commentary.” This encourages the filter to allocate the bulk of its reasoning to the relevant intent.\n\n4. Incorporate a clarification step. In cases where the language is ambiguous or there are multiple requests, you might have the gatekeeper either ask for clarification or default to a safe interpretation by discarding secondary instructions. For instance, “If the request includes actions outside your safe set, only accept the explicitly supported action if it is clearly identified.”\n\n5. Balance strictness with fuzziness by guiding the model with explicit definitions. You can include a list of supported synonyms or phrases that you consider valid. Then ask the model to map the user input to one of those actions. At the same time, you can instruct it: “Do not try to generate an answer to parts of the text that do not match these defined actions.”\n\n6. Experiment with thresholds. If you find that the model sometimes hallucinates or goes too far, consider a threshold check where if the output deviates from the allowed patterns, it returns a “cannot parse” message. Similarly, use examples in your prompt that demonstrate successful interpretation of informal language.\n\nIn essence, the approach might be a blend of:\n • Clear definitions and boundaries (what’s supported, what’s extraneous)\n • Using example-driven instructions in the prompt\n • Decomposing the problem so that the tasks of intent recognition and safe action execution are handled, possibly by different prompt steps or even different model calls.\n\nThis strategy tends to reduce false negatives (rejecting valid requests due to too-strict parsing) while preventing false positives (processing dangerous, extraneous, or multi-step requests). It’s a trade-off, but having modular steps and clear examples often leads to a more reliable filter.\n\nHope this provides some fresh ideas for further refinement!",

This is a common architectural pattern that many teams struggle with, and you're right that finding the sweet spot between overly restrictive and overly permissive filtering is tricky.\n\nHere are some strategic approaches that often work well for this type of system:\n\n**Decomposed Validation Approach:**\nInstead of a single \"approve/reject\" decision, consider breaking validation into multiple focused checks:\n- Intent extraction (what action is being requested?)\n- Scope validation (is this action within allowed boundaries?)\n- Confidence scoring (how clear/unambiguous is the request?)\n\n**Structured Output + Fallback:**\nHave your gatekeeper return structured data rather than just binary decisions. Something like:\n- Primary intent + confidence level\n- Any secondary/unclear intents flagged\n- Specific validation concerns\nThis gives your downstream system more context to work with.\n\n**Progressive Filtering:**\nUse multiple lightweight passes rather than one complex prompt:\n1. Basic intent classification\n2. Scope boundary check\n3. Ambiguity/multi-intent detection\n\n**Prompt Design Patterns:**\n- Use explicit examples of edge cases in your few-shot prompting\n- Include \"uncertain\" as a valid response category\n- Frame the task as \"extract and validate\" rather than just \"approve/reject\"\n\nThe key insight is often that trying to solve everything in one prompt creates competing objectives. Breaking it down usually yields better results and makes debugging much easier.\n\nWhat's your current prompt structure like?

You want to avoid being too strict (blocking good requests) or too lenient (letting in problematic/ambiguous ones or hallucinating).\n\nHere are some suggestions to help you refine your approach:\n\n1. Explicitly Define Allowed Actions  \nList the actions your system supports in the prompt. For example:  \nAllowed actions: delete channel, create channel, list channels, etc.\n\n2. Use Step-by-Step Reasoning  \nAsk the LLM to first extract the user's intent as structured data, then check if it's in the allowed list. For example:  \nStep 1: What is the user's intent?  \nStep 2: Does it match an allowed action?  \nStep 3: If not, reject.\n\n3. Add Examples (Few-shot Prompting)  \nShow the LLM examples of borderline/colloquial requests and how they should be handled. For example:  \nUser: \"kinda delete this channel\"  \nAllowed: Yes, intent is \"delete channel\".\n\nUser: \"create a channel and tell me a joke\"  \nAllowed: Only \"create channel\" is valid; ignore the joke.\n\n4. Require Justification in Output  \nAsk the LLM to explain its reasoning in the response (even if you only use the verdict), which can help reduce hallucinations.\n\n5. Set Output to Structured Format  \nHave the LLM reply in a structured (JSON, YAML, etc.) format, e.g.:  \n{ \"intent\": \"delete channel\", \"valid\": true, \"reason\": \"intent matches allowed action\" }\n\n6. Consider a Two-Pass System  \nIf the first pass is unsure, ask for human or higher-level validation, or fall back to a stricter set of rules.\n\n7. Regularly Update Prompts with New Edge Cases  \nMonitor failure cases and update your examples and allowed actions accordingly.\n\nExample Prompt (illustrative):\n\nYou are a gatekeeper. Your job is to check if the user's request matches one of these allowed actions: [delete channel, create channel, list channels].  \n- If yes, output the action and say valid.  \n- If no, say invalid.\n\nExamples:  \nUser: \"kinda delete this channel\"  \nOutput: { \"intent\": \"delete channel\", \"valid\": true }\n\nUser: \"create a channel and tell me a joke\"  \nOutput: { \"intent\": \"create channel\", \"valid\": true }  \nNote: Ignore unrelated requests.\n\nUser: \"tell me a joke\"  \nOutput: { \"intent\": null, \"valid\": false }\n\nConclusion\n\nPrompting is iterative—expect to adjust as you encounter new user behaviors. If you want more tailored advice, feel free to share more details (user base, domain, example prompts, etc.).\n\nLet me know if you want more sample prompts or have specific edge cases to discuss!",

By isolating the check, your main model won’t get distracted by borderline or obviously invalid requests.  \n\n2) Expect and handle colloquialisms and synonyms.  \n   • Your checker prompt can benefit from examples illustrating normal variations of user speech (“kinda delete,” “removeish,” “wipe out,” etc.).  \n   • Use paraphrases in few-shot examples to demonstrate that the user’s “kinda” or “sorta” or “please help me remove” all map to the same valid action.\n\n3) Keep the gatekeeper narrow.  \n   • The gatekeeper’s job is not to do everything—only to verify that the request is recognized and permissible (or politely returned if it’s out of scope).  \n   • Resist the urge to handle expansions (like “tell me a joke” appended to a legitimate action). The gatekeeper can reject or flag any additional requests unrelated to the known domain.\n\n4) Use “strict enough” phrasing in your gatekeeper prompt.  \n   • Overly creative or open language can make the checker interpret ambiguous requests too liberally—leading to hallucinated validations.  \n   • At the same time, ensuring your gatekeeper tries to interpret colloquial or partial instructions adds flexibility. Balance comes from carefully chosen examples in your gating prompt.\n\n5) Iterate with feedback loops.  \n   • Log borderline or misclassified requests and feed these back into your prompt refinement—especially if users often phrase requests in certain ambiguous ways.  \n   • Keep adjusting your few-shot samples to cover tricky edge cases you encounter in production.\n\n6) Consider re-prompting for clarity if unsure.  \n   • Instead of hard failing, your gatekeeper can respond with, “Did you mean X or Y?” This mini-conversation can quickly clarify the user’s intention before passing it on to the main model.  \n   • This approach can cut down on false rejections of valid but oddly phrased requests.\n\n7) For out-of-scope or disallowed requests, respond consistently.  \n   • Return a standardized, safe response (“Sorry, I can’t help with that.”), so you don’t inadvertently engage with or escalate invalid requests.\n\nIn practice, you’ll likely keep refining prompts over time.

          "response": "It looks like you’re building a gatekeeper system—a first-line “LLM Call” that validates and filters natural language requests before passing them on to a more capable (and potentially riskier) model downstream. I understand the challenge: striking the right balance between being strict enough to catch problematic inputs and flexible enough to correctly interpret valid, but colloquial or ambiguous, user requests.\n\nHere are a few thoughts on strategies you might consider:\n\n1. Dual-Stage Filtering:  \n • You could run the user input through an initial, lightweight classifier that determines intent and flags potential safety issues, and then—if it passes—hand it off to a secondary, more nuanced evaluator.  \n • This separation can help isolate the “delete” intent from extraneous parts of a request (like the “joke” in “create a channel and tell me a joke”) without over-penalizing colloquial language.\n\n2. Explicit Role Instructions and Examples:  \n • In your prompt, clearly define the roles. For example, instruct the model to first extract the core actionable intent and then check if that intent is within the allowed scope.  \n • Provide concrete examples (and counterexamples) in the prompt so the model learns the patterns of acceptable versus unacceptable requests.\n\n3. Chain-of-Thought for Intent Decomposition:  \n • Ask the model to break down the request into distinct parts: one focused on the intended action (like “delete this channel”) and another capturing any extraneous input (e.g., jokes or side comments).  \n • This might reduce misclassification by forcing an explicit analysis—helping the model to decide which parts of the input are important for the gatekeeping decision.\n\n4. Balancing Safety and Utility:  \n • If you push too much on the side of safety (strict filtering), you risk false negatives on valid input. Conversely, being too flexible might let problematic instructions through.  \n • Consider implementing an iterative refinement loop—if the gatekeeper is uncertain, it might ask a clarifying question or flag the request for human review. This can be a hybrid approach that preserves user experience while managing risk.\n\n5. Testing with Real-World Data:  \n • It’s essential to test the gatekeeper on a wide variety of inputs that reflect genuine user language variability.  \n • Gather examples from both “in-scope” and “edge-case” scenarios to continuously adjust the prompt, ensuring that it understands colloquial expressions without compromising safety.\n\nIt seems like you’re on the right track, and these suggestions might help fine-tune your approach. Sometimes the challenge is less about finding a perfect prompt and more about setting up a robust evaluation loop that can adapt over time as user language evolves. \n\nI hope this offers a helpful perspective—happy to chat more about any specifics as you continue refining your system!",

          "response": "Absolutely, this is a classic challenge in designing LLM-based gatekeepers! Here are some strategy thoughts and prompting approaches you might consider:\n\n1. Explicit Task Scoping in Prompt  \nBe very clear in your prompt about the scope of actions the gatekeeper can validate. For example:  \n\"Your job is to check if the user's request is a valid single action from this list: [list of actions]. Ignore any requests outside this list or multiple actions in the same request.\"  \nThis can help the LLM focus and reduce hallucination.\n\n2. Usage of Examples (Few-Shot Learning)  \nProvide several positive and negative examples, especially ones that are borderline or colloquial. For instance:  \n- \"delete this channel\" → valid  \n- \"kinda delete this channel\" → valid  \n- \"create a channel and tell me a joke\" → invalid (multiple actions)  \nIncluding edge cases will help the model generalize better.\n\n3. \"Refuse Uncertain\" Principle  \nInstruct the model to err on the side of caution if unsure:  \n\"If you are not certain the request is a valid single action, refuse it.\"  \nThis can help prevent over-flexibility.\n\n4. Iterative Prompt Tuning  \nIt's often an iterative process: collect failures, add them as examples, and refine. Over time, you'll build a robust prompt tuned to your specific domain and user style.\n\n5. Consider Decomposition  \nInstead of a single gatekeeper, you might have one model classify the intent(s), and another validate. This modular approach can sometimes help, but does increase complexity and latency.\n\n6. Community Feedback Loop  \nSince you’re open to feedback, having a place for users to flag false positives/negatives can help you improve the system over time.\n\nHappy to chat more if you want to dig into specific scenarios or trade notes on what’s worked/failed in practice!

          "response": "Here are a few higher-level strategies you might try:\n\n1) Layered Interpretation:  \n   • First pass: Quickly parse the user’s natural-language request into a structured form (or “intent + arguments”). Keep the text that’s out of scope—or unclear—separate from the primary command.  \n   • Second pass: Evaluate that structured intent against allowed actions (“delete channel,” “create channel,” etc.). This second pass operates on a narrower, well-defined context (just the recognized intent/arguments).\n\n2) Rigorous Negative Examples:  \n   • Train (or prompt) your filtering model on intentionally imprecise, colloquial, or combined user requests (e.g., “kinda delete,” “delete a channel and tell me a joke”).  \n   • Show the gatekeeper both positive examples (where it should confidently pass the request) and negative examples (where it should fail or request clarification).\n\n3) “Safe-Fail” Clarifications:  \n   • Instead of outright rejecting or accepting uncertain requests, encourage the gatekeeper to defer with a clarifying question. For example: “Did you mean to delete Channel A?”  \n   • This approach deals with partial or ambiguous instructions gracefully while preventing hallucinated or nonsensical validations.\n\n4) Narrowed Output Scope:  \n   • Make it explicit at the prompt level: the gatekeeper is allowed to output only “Yes, valid,” “No, invalid,” or “Needs clarification,” along with a short reason.  \n   • By limiting its possible actions and removing free-text explanation, you reduce the risk of it straying into out-of-scope tasks (like telling jokes).\n\n5) Iterative Prompt Refinement:  \n   • Keep logs of borderline or failed interactions to see where the gatekeeper gets confused—are there specific words or phrasing that trigger incorrect rejections or acceptance?  \n   • Adjust examples or instructions in the prompt to handle those corner cases. Over time you’ll accumulate a “playbook” of known difficulties.\n\n6) Final Sanity Check:  \n   • Depending on how critical correctness is, you could run a final, stricter validation on the gatekeeper’s output. For example, if the gatekeeper returns “Yes, valid,” you might have a minimal set of business rules (like verifying the user’s permissions) to catch potential mistakes.\n\nUltimately, it’s all about iterating on your prompt with real-world queries—especially the messy ones. The more carefully you define the context, allowed actions, and response format, the better shot you have at filtering requests reliably without being so strict that you block everyday phrasing.",

          "response": "It sounds like you’re wrestling with a classic trade-off between precision (being strict enough to catch dangerous or costly actions) and recall (accepting valid, colloquially phrased requests). Here are a few strategic approaches you might consider:\n\n1. Two-tier parsing: Instead of trying to have one prompt do both robust natural language understanding and strict filtering, split the task. Use one lightweight, flexible prompt to extract the user’s intent and key parameters (e.g., action type and target). Then have a second, simpler check that maps the intent to allowed actions. This can help decouple the more forgiving natural language understanding from the rigid validation stage.\n\n2. Use explicit examples: For the initial intent extraction stage, provide clear, diverse examples of both acceptable and borderline phrasings. In your prompt, illustrate cases like “kinda delete this channel” and “please create a channel and tell me a joke,” clarifying what part of the input is relevant. This may help the model learn to ignore extraneous details while focusing on core actions.\n\n3. Hybrid rule-based filters: Consider combining the LLM’s output with lightweight rule-based logic. For instance, after the LLM extracts an action, a simple mapping rule or even a small set of handcrafted patterns can verify whether the intent is within scope. This reduces the burden on the LLM to be perfect about both understanding and safety.\n\n4. Confidence scoring and fallback: If you can get the model to provide a confidence rating or if you can use multiple query variants to see consistency, implement a system where controversial or ambiguous requests are flagged for further review or processed with a more conservative fallback. This may mitigate both false negatives (unnecessarily rejecting) and false positives (allowing unsafe requests).\n\n5. Iterative testing and feedback loops: Finally, gather a diverse set of real user inputs and then test your prompts extensively. Iteratively adjust the examples and instructions based on observed failure modes. Sometimes initial strictness might need to be softened in a second iteration after you see where the failures occur in real-world usage.\n\nIn your scenario, having a “gatekeeper” that simply identifies the key intent with example-driven robustness before passing on a sanitized intent to an expensive model sounds promising. The key seems to be separating understanding from verification so that each can be optimized independently.\n\nHope these ideas help spark the next step in your robust gatekeeper design!",

Let's walk through what your ALGORITHM ProcessRequest would do with the given INPUT, and then I'll offer some strategic thoughts as requested.\n\nStep-by-step breakdown:\n\n1. **Parse(request)**  \n   The algorithm would take the user's message (the \"Hey everyone...\" paragraph) and attempt to parse it. In your example, this is a meta-request: someone describing their engineering challenge and seeking discussion.\n\n2. **Execute(request)**  \n   Based on the description, the action would be to process the request as intended—in this context, that would mean evaluating the actual question, which is:  \n   “I’m looking for a second opinion from anyone with experience in building robust LLM agents or setting up complex guardrails. I’m not looking for code, just a quick chat about strategy and different prompting approaches.”\n\n3. **Return result**  \n   The result would be: a response or engagement offering thoughts on strategy for prompt engineering in the described \"gatekeeper\" scenario.\n\n**So, for your ALGORITHM and this INPUT, the result would be:**\n\n---\n\n**result:**\n\nHi! I’ve worked on similar systems and the balance you’re describing is a common challenge in prompt engineering for LLM-based filtering. Here are some high-level strategies you might consider:\n\n1. **Explicit Action Extraction:**  \n   Instead of having the gatekeeper judge natural language holistically, have it first extract the intended action(s) in a structured format (e.g., “delete channel”), then validate those actions. This separates intent recognition from validation, which can reduce hallucinations and over-flexibility.\n\n2. **Negative Prompting:**  \n   Add instructions like “If the request includes multiple unrelated actions, only process the supported one(s) and ignore the rest.” This helps the LLM avoid trying to process out-of-scope parts, like the “tell me a joke.”\n\n3. **Colloquialism Mapping:**  \n   Include examples of colloquial or indirect commands in your prompt, mapping them to canonical forms (“kinda delete this channel” → “delete channel”). This can help the model learn what to accept without loosening the guardrails overall.\n\n4. **Confidence Estimation:**  \n   Have the gatekeeper output a confidence score or a reason for rejection. If confidence is low (e.g., “I am not sure if this is a delete command”), you can either escalate to human review or pass to the more powerful model as a fallback.\n\n5. **Iterative Prompt Refinement:**  \n   Collect a dataset of real, borderline queries. Use these as test cases whenever you update your prompt—this helps ensure you’re not overfitting on one type of language and that you maintain the right balance.\n\n6. **Chain-of-Thought or Step-by-Step Reasoning:**  \n   Prompt the gatekeeper to “think aloud” (internally) about what the user likely means, then decide if the intent matches an allowed/valid action. Sometimes this helps with ambiguous or indirect phrasing.\n\nWould be happy to discuss any of these in more detail! Let me know if you want to chat further or have specific scenarios you’re struggling with.\n\n---\n\nThis approach matches your request for a strategic, conversational answer rather than code, and it shows how the ALGORITHM would process a meta-level request for advice.",

          "success": false,
          "response": "Here's one way to think about it:\n\nThe pseudocode you posted is essentially outlining a three‐step process: first, take the raw natural language input and break it down (Parse); second, perform some intermediate reasoning or evaluation of the input (Execute); and finally, provide an outcome (Return result). Translating that into a strategy for a gatekeeper LLM prompt, here are some ideas:\n\n1. Two‑phase reasoning:\n  • In the first phase you “parse” the layered meaning of the request. This might involve asking the model (or a helper function) to extract and label the intent. For example, it could identify that “kinda delete this channel” signals a deletion intent. \n  • In the second phase (“execution”), the system evaluates whether the identified intent is safe and correctly falls within the allowed scope. For multi-part requests (such as “create a channel and tell me a joke”), you might want the filter to separate parts: approve or deny the allowed part (the creation operation) and flag or ignore the out‐of‐scope part (joke).\n\n2. Leverage chain-of-thought guidance:\n  Because natural language requests can be ambiguous, using a chain-of-thought prompt can help the LLM explain its reasoning. For instance, if a request is colloquial, you could ask it to explain what it understands step by step before deciding if the command is valid. This “explain-then-decide” approach could help mitigate both false positives (rejecting valid commands) and false negatives (accidentally processing out-of-scope requests).\n\n3. Iterative prompt design:\n  • If the prompt is too strict, the system might misinterpret variations (“kinda delete” vs. “delete”). Consider incorporating examples or clarifying phrases in the prompt itself that emphasize recognition of slang or colloquial language.\n  • If it’s too flexible, you need boundaries. One strategy is to clearly define the scope of acceptable actions early in the prompt and ask the LLM to ignore any parts of the request that fall outside of those bounds.\n\n4. Guardrails via post-processing:\n  Rather than relying solely on one pass, you might have the LLM produce its interpretation (or even a “confidence score”) for each identified action. Then, a lightweight algorithm (a separate check) can determine which parts are allowed to pass through and which ones need to be rejected or deferred to a more powerful model.\n\n5. Feedback loop for fine-tuning:\n  Once you have an initial version, gather data on misclassifications—from both valid inputs being rejected and overzealous interpretations capturing out-of-scope requests. Use this data to adjust your prompt strategy incrementally. This feedback loop can help you find the sweet spot between flexibility and strictness.\n\nIn short, the “Parse, Execute, Return” structure maps well onto a multi-step reasoning process within your gatekeeper. Start by parsing the request to extract intents, execute by reasoning over those intents (including a chain-of-thought for clarity), and then return a verdict that’s either to proceed with the intended action, ask for clarification, or block the request if it’s partially or fully out of scope. This modular approach can help you fine-tune the safety and intelligence of your system while keeping the expensive model out of the loop when possible. \n\nHope these ideas help spark a productive discussion or inspire a revised prompting strategy!",

Prompt Engineering: Balance Precision and Recall\n- **Explicit Instruction**: In your gatekeeper prompt, be very clear about what constitutes a valid request, ideally with a few varied examples (including both colloquial and formal language).\n- **Negative Examples**: Show what should be rejected (e.g., \"create a channel and tell me a joke\" → reject, as jokes are out of scope).\n- **Ambiguity Handling**: Indicate in the prompt that if part of the request is unclear or out-of-scope, the model should only process the supported part and flag the rest.\n\n2. Two-Stage Filtering\n- **Pre-filter**: Use a light, deterministic check (regex, keyword match, intent classifier) to weed out obviously invalid requests before the LLM.\n- **LLM Gatekeeper**: Use the LLM for nuanced cases, leveraging its language understanding.\n\n3. Decomposition\n- Train the LLM to decompose compound requests. For example, \"create a channel and tell me a joke\" → [\"create a channel\", \"tell me a joke\"]. Then, only pass through the valid parts.\n\n4. Response Formatting\n- Ask the LLM to respond in a structured way, e.g.:\n  - valid: true/false\n  - reason: [explanation]\n  - action: [if any]\n- This makes downstream decision logic safer and more auditable.\n\n5. Conservative Defaults\n- If in doubt, err on the side of caution and reject/flag ambiguous requests (with a helpful message to the user).\n\n6. Continuous Feedback Loop\n- Log borderline/gated requests and periodically review them to tune your prompt and examples.\n\n7. LLM Selection\n- Consider using a smaller, faster model for the gatekeeper (as you’re already doing), but make sure it’s fine-tuned for classification/guardrails if possible.\n\n8. Prompt Iteration\n- Prompting is iterative! Keep a test set of user requests (including edge cases) to evaluate prompt tweaks quantitatively.\n\nIn summary: combine explicit prompts with examples, structured outputs, a pre-filter if possible, and a feedback loop for ongoing improvement. This is an area where \"close enough\" keeps getting better with real data and iteration.\n\nHappy to discuss specific scenarios or examples if you want to dive deeper!",

          "response": "Hey, I’ve definitely run into similar issues when chaining a lighter validation model in front of a heavier one. Here are a few thought-starters that might help:\n\n1) Use a Structured Decision Flow.  \n   • Instead of one fuzzy “Should I validate this or not?” question, break the problem into smaller yes/no or multiple-choice decisions you ask the gatekeeper LLM. For instance:\n       1. “Is this request in scope for our system?”  \n       2. “Does it require more than one action or domain (e.g., creation vs. entertainment)?”  \n       3. “Is it expressed clearly enough to proceed without confusion?”  \n   • This reduces the chance of the model hallucinating or mixing domains (like responding with a joke) because it’s focused on narrow classification steps.\n\n2) Sub-Parse Requests.  \n   • When the user says “create a channel and tell me a joke,” you can instruct the gatekeeper model to parse it into sub-tasks:  \n       1. “Create a channel.”  \n       2. “Tell me a joke.”  \n   • Then apply specialized rules: if the “tell me a joke” part is out of scope, simply skip it or politely decline, but still pass along the valid “create channel” part.\n\n3) Provide Clear “In/Out-of-Scope” Examples in the Prompt.  \n   • Few-shot examples really help. Include borderline or colloquial examples you’ve seen in practice—like “kinda delete this channel”—and demonstrate the correct interpretation (“yes, that means ‘delete this channel’”).  \n   • Also include an example where a user lumps in an out-of-scope request with a valid request, and show the correct handling (ignoring or rejecting the irrelevant piece while still accepting the valid request).\n\n4) Emphasize “Don’t Guess” in Your Prompt.  \n   • Let the gatekeeper LLM know explicitly: “If you are not 100% confident about user intent, ask clarifying questions or refuse to proceed.”  \n   • That helps reduce hallucinations. You can even create a separate path for re-prompting the user or clarifying instructions before finally passing it to the heavier model.\n\n5) Pre-Label Partial Ambiguities.  \n   • If you see patterns in colloquial language—“kinda,” “sort of,” “ish”—you could add rules or a custom dictionary to interpret them as “soft but valid” commands.  \n   • This can be as simple as customizing the prompt with “Any phrases like ‘kinda’ or ‘sort of’ still indicate a direct action request,” so the model doesn’t over-reject.\n\n6) Consider a Fallback Strategy.  \n   • Worst case, if the gatekeeper’s confidence is low or it can’t disambiguate the user’s request, have it return a single standardized response like: “I need more information—please rephrase.” This can be cheaper than letting mistakes slide through to the expensive model.\n\nA layered or step-by-step approach (instead of forcing the LLM to handle everything at once) usually makes these guardrail systems more resilient. That said, there’s always a bit of tweaking involved to dial in the right strictness. If you want to chat more specifics about prompt architecture or trouble spots, feel free to ping me!",

          "response": "Here are some strategies you might consider for balancing the filter’s strictness and flexibility:\n\n1. Define clear, discrete intents first. Instead of one monolithic prompt that both understands colloquial language and checks for multi-part actions, you could first pass the input through an intent classification phase. In this phase the model identifies one or more canonical actions (e.g., “delete channel,” “create channel”) from the potentially colloquial language (“kinda delete this channel”). Once the intents are identified, you can apply per-intent validation rules.\n\n2. Use a hierarchical or multi-step prompting design. For instance, have a first step where the LLM “paraphrases” or normalizes the request into a standardized schema. Then, in a follow-up step, validate that the parsed request meets your allowed actions. This decouples the natural language understanding from the validation logic and lets you fine-tune each step independently.\n\n3. Explicitly instruct the model to ignore or flag additional, out-of-scope requests. If a user says “create a channel and tell me a joke,” you might instruct the LLM to only consider the first valid supported action (“create a channel”) and either ignore or flag extra parts. For example, “Only process requests that fall entirely within our supported list. If additional unsupported components are detected, provide a clarifying question or error.”\n\n4. Build in a confidence threshold or fallback mechanism. Have the LLM provide an intermediate output—its best guess at the intended action. If the confidence is low or if the output contains multiple actions, then instead of processing the request, gate it for manual review or ask the user for clarification. This way, you minimize errors when the input is ambiguous or when multiple intents are mixed.\n\n5. Experiment with prompt “temperature” settings and example-based few-shot learning, where you provide examples of mixed or colloquial inputs along with the desired normalized output. This can help the model learn to handle edge cases (such as “kinda delete” for “delete”) while not over-interpreting extra requests.\n\n6. Keep logging and monitoring in place. Detailed logs will help you audit when the model inappropriately rejects a valid request or hallucinates an unsupported action. The log insight can inform prompt refinements over time.\n\nIn short, break down the task into interpretation, normalization, and validation steps. This layered approach should help mitigate the risk of rejecting valid requests due to overly strict rules while keeping the system from processing unsupported actions due to overly loose criteria.\n\nThese strategies aren’t code-specific and can be adapted to various prompt-engineering techniques or even combined with lightweight rule-based post-processing. Happy experimenting, and hope this helps you unlock that perfect balance!",

This lets you:\n- Auto-approve high confidence (>90%)\n- Auto-reject low confidence (<50%)\n- Flag medium confidence for human review or additional processing\n\n### 5. **Semantic Similarity Matching**\nInstead of pure prompt engineering, consider:\n- Pre-computing embeddings of valid actions\n- Comparing user input embeddings to find closest match\n- Using LLM only for ambiguous cases\n\n### 6. **Chain-of-Thought with Constraints**\nStructure the prompt to force step-by-step reasoning:\n```\n\"1. Extract the main verb/action\n2. Normalize it to standard form\n3. Check if it's in allowed list\n4. Extract the object/target\n5.

Example-Driven Prompting (\"Few-shot\")**\n- Provide diverse examples of valid/invalid requests, including edge cases:\n  - Colloquial: \"kinda delete this channel\" → VALID\n  - Compound: \"create a channel and tell me a joke\" → INVALID (too many actions)\n  - Ambiguous: \"do the thing\" → INVALID (unclear intent)\n- This helps the model generalize without overfitting to strict or loose interpretations.\n\n**3.

Scope Reminder**\n- In the prompt, remind the model of what is \"in scope\" (e.g., only channel actions) and instruct it to ignore or flag out-of-scope requests.\n\n**5. Modularization**\n- If possible, **separate intent extraction** from validation, or run them as chained steps. This reduces compounding error.\n\n**6.

          "response": "Here are a few considerations and practical angles you might explore when crafting a gatekeeper prompt and system architecture:\n\n1) Use “triage” classification before validation.  \n   • Instead of having a single LLM both interpret and validate user requests at once, consider a lightweight classification pass (e.g., a simpler zero-/few-shot model or even a rule-based filter) to bucket requests into categories (e.g., “destructive action,” “creation request,” “irrelevant chat,” etc.).  \n   • Only after you categorize the request do you pass it to an LLM that is specialized in either confirming validity or clarifying ambiguous/spurious content. This layered approach often works better than “one big prompt that does everything.”\n\n2) Dynamically adapt strictness.  \n   • Use a short, general-purpose prompt prefix that sets minimal guardrails. Then follow with a dynamic, context-driven set of clarifications or expansions based on the user’s category.  \n   • For instance, if it’s a deletion request and it arrives with colloquial language, the gatekeeper might add a clarifying sub-prompt (“Check if the user really wants to delete. Consider synonyms like ‘nuke,’ ‘remove,’ or ‘kinda delete’ as valid for that intent.”). This approach keeps you from over-tightening guardrails by letting the system adapt to the recognized category.\n\n3) Incorporate a “reflect & confirm” step.  \n   • After the gatekeeper LLM interprets the request, you can prompt it one more time (in a quick subsequent step) to confirm if the interpretation was faithful and if it aligns with policy. For example:  \n        1. Gatekeeper LLM interprets: “User wants to delete channel.”  \n        2. System: “Could you verify if ‘kinda delete this channel’ is equivalent to ‘delete this channel’? Are there any policy violations?”  \n   • This extra reflection step can catch borderline misinterpretations before final acceptance.\n\n4) Calibrate with real user data and iterative reviews.  \n   • If possible, gather examples of actual user queries and see how your gatekeeper + final LLM pipeline handles them. Keep track of where things fail (either false positive rejections or unexpected hallucinations).  \n   • Continuously refine your validation prompt with these real-world, “ugly” examples rather than exclusively contrived or simple test prompts.\n\n5) Keep gatekeeper prompts minimal and purely for gating.  \n   • Resist the urge to combine comedic or creative generation tasks inside the same gatekeeping step. Instead, keep the gatekeeper’s scope narrow: “Am I certain about the user’s intent? Should we proceed?”  \n   • This helps avoid a scenario where the gatekeeper tries to do out-of-scope tasks (e.g., telling a joke or fully solving the user’s request by itself).\n\n6) Plan for fallback or partial acceptance.  \n   • When the user’s request is partially valid—like “create a channel and tell me a joke”—you might want the system to accept the creation request but defer or filter the joke part.  \n   • The gatekeeper’s job then might be to break down and confirm which parts are valid, returning something like: “Channel creation is valid. Joke-telling is out of scope for the system,” or “We can only create a channel; you might need a different endpoint for jokes.”\n\n7) Document your policies for the gatekeeper thoroughly.  \n   • Clearly define guidelines for what is “safe” vs. “invalid” or “unparseable.”  \n   • This can be simple bullet points in your system or developer docs so you have something concrete to reference when refining prompts.\n\nOverall, the gist is to keep your gatekeeper prompt (and the model behind it) ruthlessly focused on interpreting user requests in a manner consistent with policy, not on performing or elaborating on those requests. By layering classification, reflection, and minimal clarifications, you can strike a better balance between too rigid (“Reject everything that sounds slightly off”) and too lenient (“Interpret everything, even unrelated or out-of-policy requests”). \n\nGood luck tinkering with the balance—it always takes a few iterations with real data to hone the sweet spot!",

          "response": "Here are some things to consider as you iterate on your gatekeeper prompt strategy:\n\n1. Define a clear scope for the gatekeeper. In other words, explicitly specify exactly what kinds of actions or intents are valid. For example, if the gatekeeper is only meant to allow or block “channel” operations, make sure that its instructions say something like “only consider requests related to creating, deleting, or modifying channels.” This helps prevent the model from trying to interpret out-of-scope actions (like “tell me a joke”).\n\n2. Use layered checking. Instead of expecting one prompt to handle all cases, consider a multistage process:\n  a. First stage: Use a softer, more flexible prompt that extracts the user’s overall intent (even if it's colloquial) and then normalizes or maps it to controlled operations.\n  b. Second stage: Validate that the normalized intent strictly conforms to your allowed operations. This stage can cost less if it’s mostly a simpler decision or even rule-based logic.\n\n3. Introduce clarifying steps in the prompt itself. You could instruct the model to “explain your reasoning” before deciding whether the request falls within the allowed scope. This chain-of-thought explanation is not used directly for the final decision but helps the gatekeeper judge whether the input phrase can be mapped properly or if it’s ambiguous or out-of-scope.\n\n4. Use examples in the prompt. Provide varied examples of how colloquial or indirect language maps to a valid intent (like “kinda delete this channel” should map to a delete operation). Then, similarly include clear examples of what should be rejected. This should help the model generalize better to nonliteral inputs.\n\n5. Balance strictness with fallback options. For ambiguous requests that mix allowed and disallowed operations (e.g., “create a channel and tell me a joke”), consider having the gatekeeper extract the allowed part (channel creation) and explicitly ignore or flag the extra part. Instructions might be something like “Only process the channel operation and ignore any additional requests.”\n\n6. Think about verification on the expensive model side. Even if the gatekeeper misses some nuance, you might set up your pipeline so that if the user’s request does something that might be out of scope, the expensive model performs an extra check before processing. That may relax some of the strictness you need in the gatekeeper.\n\n7. Iterate with feedback. No matter the approach, gathering edge cases and feedback from real-world user inputs is critical. Use these cases to adjust the prompt so that the gatekeeper learns from its mistakes (e.g., refine examples, add clarifying sentences, or adjust thresholds) without requiring a complete rewrite.\n\nOverall, a combination of explicit scoping, example-driven instructions, multi-stage processing, and clear guidelines about what to ignore or extract can often help strike the right balance between smartness (understanding colloquial language) and safety (only allowing intended actions). Experiment and iterate—the best approach might require adjustments based on how users naturally phrase their commands.",

You've articulated the core challenge well - finding the right balance between being too strict and too flexible in the prompt design. Here are some thoughts and strategies that may help:\n\n1. Intent Classification: Instead of trying to directly map user input to specific actions, consider first classifying the general intent. This could help handle colloquial phrasings better.\n\n2. Two-Stage Validation: You could implement a two-stage process where the first stage broadly classifies the intent, and the second stage does a more specific validation.\n\n3. Explicit Scope Definition: In your prompt, be very explicit about what actions are in scope. This could help prevent the model from trying to process out-of-scope elements.\n\n4. Examples and Few-Shot Learning: Provide a diverse set of examples in your prompt, including both valid and invalid requests, to help the model understand the boundaries.\n\n5. Confidence Thresholds: Implement a confidence score for the model's decisions, and only act on high-confidence outputs.\n\n6. Iterative Refinement: Start with a stricter prompt and gradually relax it based on real-world usage data.\n\n7. User Feedback Loop: Implement a mechanism for users to provide feedback when their valid requests are incorrectly rejected, and use this to improve your system.\n\n8. Custom Fine-Tuning: If possible, fine-tune the model on a dataset specific to your use case.\n\n9. Hybrid Approach: Combine rule-based filtering with the LLM for more reliable results.\n\n10. Regular Expression Pre-filtering: Use regex to catch obvious cases before passing to the LLM.\n\nThese strategies can be mixed and matched based on your specific needs. The key is to start with a clear definition of what constitutes a valid request in your system and then experiment with different approaches to achieve that balance.\n\nIf you'd like to discuss this further or dive into more specific strategies, feel free to reach out.

Here are a few strategic considerations and prompting approaches that might help refine your gatekeeper system:\n\n1. Explicit Scope Definition in the Prompt\n- Clearly enumerate the types of actions/requests that are allowed. For example:  \n  Your job is to only allow requests that correspond to one of the following actions: [list actions]. If the request does not clearly match one of these actions, or includes multiple actions, reject it.\n- This helps the model anchor to a whitelist, reducing hallucination or out-of-scope validation.\n\n2. Encourage Conservative Passes\n- Instruct the model to err on the side of caution:  \n  If you are unsure whether a request is valid, reject it and ask for clarification.\n- This helps with ambiguous or colloquial phrasing but may lead to a few more false negatives (users needing to rephrase).\n\n3. Handle Colloquial or Ambiguous Phrasing\n- Add examples of borderline/colloquial requests that should be accepted, and those that should not.  \n  E.g.:  \n  Accept: \"kinda delete this channel\" → Intent = delete  \n  Reject: \"Can you create a channel and also tell me a joke?\" (multiple intents)\n- This can help the model generalize appropriately.\n\n4. For Multi-Intent/Out-of-Scope Handling\n- Tell the model:  \n  Only process requests that contain a single, in-scope action. If the request contains multiple actions or is out of scope, reject it.\n- Show examples of what to do when a user tries to combine actions.\n\n5. Consider a Two-Step Filter\n- First, check if the request matches the allowed action set (semantic matching, regex, or LLM-powered).  \n- Second, check if the request contains only one action and is not ambiguous.\n\n6. Accept Some False Negatives\n- It's often safer to require the user to clarify (and retry) than to let something unsafe or out-of-process through. This is especially true if you escalate to a more powerful model afterwards.\n\n7. Continuous Iteration\n- As you collect real-world examples of false positives/negatives, update your prompt with new edge cases.  \n- Run regular evaluations with a test set of tricky requests.\n\nIn summary, lean on explicit action whitelists, conservative phrasing, and lots of examples in your prompt. Accept a degree of strictness up front, but iterate as you gather more data.

          "response": "Here are a few prompting strategies and higher-level considerations I’ve seen work well in gatekeeper setups:\n\n1. Tiered Parsing and Validation:\n   • First, parse the user request into a concise structured form (e.g., “Action: Delete Channel,” “Action: Tell Joke,” etc.).  \n   • Then, evaluate whether the action(s) match expected, supported behaviors (like “Delete Channel”).  \n   • If there’s an unexpected or out-of-scope add-on (“Tell Joke”), you can return a response indicating partial support (“Yes to deleting channel, no to jokes”) or prompt for clarification.\n\n2. Conservative Acknowledgment + Explicit Confirm/Reject:\n   • Instead of having the gatekeeper do complicated reasoning at once, break it down:  \n     1. Identify key verbs or requests.  \n     2. For each, confirm if it falls within the system’s allowed set.  \n     3. If ambiguous, ask clarifying questions.  \n   • This approach makes it easier for the gatekeeper to stay “literal” and avoid hallucinations.  \n\n3. System + Developer Instructions for the Gatekeeper:\n   • Use strong system and developer messages:  \n     1. System-level instructions on permissible actions (e.g., “User can only do X, Y, Z. If uncertain, ask for clarification.”).  \n     2. Developer instructions telling the model to never attempt gaming the request—“Don’t fill in details if they’re not explicit,” etc.  \n   • Make them short, but unambiguous. Too much text can lead to the model missing key instructions; too general can lead to hallucinations.\n\n4. Testing for Colloquial Language:\n   • Compile a list of typical “colloquial” variants your users might use (“kinda delete,” “pls remove,” “nuke the channel”).  \n   • Make sure you test each variant to see if the gatekeeper reliably interprets it as “delete” rather than rejecting.  \n   • This iterative testing helps you pinpoint key phrases the gatekeeper model might struggle with.\n\n5. Handling Combined or “Add-On” Requests:\n   • Decide whether your gatekeeper should parse multiple requests separately (e.g., “create a channel + tell a joke”) or reject them outright if they mix topics.  \n   • Often, it’s safer to handle each request in a structured, stepwise fashion, so you don’t blend them into a single action.  \n   • You might instruct the model to output separate “Possible Actions” or a clarifying question if multiple requests appear.\n\n6. Balance Between Strictness and Flexibility:\n   • Setting up a feedback loop is key. If you see a high volume of false rejects (valid requests turned down), slightly reduce the strictness in the system instructions. If you see too many out-of-scope approvals, tighten it.  \n   • Build in a logging or review step so you can quickly iterate on your instructions when the balance shifts.\n\nOverall, the best way to home in on that balance is through iterative testing with real or representative user queries—logging gatekeeper decisions, analyzing false positives/negatives, and then refining your prompt.

          "response": "It sounds like you’re wrestling with a classic trade-off in designing these “gatekeeper” prompts: how to be strict enough to block harmful or irrelevant requests while still having the flexibility to correctly interpret user intent. Here are a few strategies and thoughts from my experience:\n\n1. Focus on intent extraction. Instead of asking the gatekeeper to validate the entire request in one shot, have it first “parse” or extract the core intent. For example, you might instruct the LLM to identify the primary action(s) (e.g., “delete,” “create”) and any modifiers. This disambiguation lets you more cleanly check if the intended operation is allowed without the noise of superfluous language or additional requests (like the joke in “create a channel and tell me a joke”).\n\n2. Use a two-phase approach. In the first phase, use a lightweight, possibly more constrained prompt to identify and extract what actions the user intends. Then, in the second phase, you can verify that the extracted intents fall within the accepted set. This “intent classifier” could be more rule-based once you extract the action words.\n\n3. Provide concrete examples and counter-examples. The prompt can be made more robust by embedding a few examples that demonstrate acceptable and unacceptable inputs. For instance, show that “kinda delete this channel” should be interpreted as a delete request, whereas a command bundling unrelated tasks (like generating a joke) should result in the operation being flagged or split. This helps define boundaries for your gatekeeper.\n\n4. Explicit instructions to ignore extraneous parts. You might clarify in your prompt that if multiple tasks are provided and only one is within scope, the gatekeeper should simply focus on the in‑scope action and ignore the rest (or respond with a clarification request). For example: “If the user combines an allowed command with an unrelated one, only validate the allowed command and indicate that the other part is not recognized.”\n\n5. Use structured output. Instead of a free-form response, you might require the model to output a structured format like JSON with fields for “action,” “parameters,” and “notes.” This forces the model to “think” in a controlled structure. Once you have the JSON, it’s easier to programmatically decide if the action is valid.\n\n6. Consider a risk scoring mechanism. Some developers use a risk or ambiguity score: if the model’s confidence for clean extraction is below a certain threshold (e.g., if it really “thinks” there are multiple conflicting intents), then simply pass the request along for further review rather than executing automatically.\n\n7. Iterate on prompt engineering. It may help to iterate with a chain-of-thought instruction in your prompt. Ask the model to first explain its reasoning about what the user is asking, then produce the final classification. This can help catch complexities. However, be cautious with chain-of-thought in a production gatekeeper since it might expose too much content in logs or be used in adversarial scenarios.\n\nThe key is to isolate the “intended” action as clearly as possible and then validate that action against your allowed schema, rather than asking the model to fully decide on a combined prompt in one go. Once you have that clarity, you can decide to either block, accept, or even further disambiguate the request.\n\nHope these thoughts help you break out of that loop.

This is a common issue when trying to build robust and reliable systems that use language models. Here are a few suggestions and considerations that might help:\n\n1. **Iterative Prompt Refinement**: Start with a broad and flexible prompt, then gradually refine it based on the types of inputs it struggles with. Analyze the failure cases and identify patterns that can help you tighten the prompt. This iterative process can help you find the sweet spot between being too strict and too flexible.\n\n2. **Contextual Understanding**: Consider incorporating context-specific information into your prompt to help the LLM better understand the user's intent. This could include details about the domain, the available actions, or the current state of the system.\n\n3. **Multi-Stage Validation**: Instead of relying on a single gatekeeper LLM, you could consider a multi-stage validation process. For example, you could have a first-pass filter that checks for obvious invalid inputs, followed by a more sophisticated gatekeeper that handles more complex cases.\n\n4. **Fallback Mechanism**: Implement a fallback mechanism that can handle cases where the gatekeeper is unsure or unable to make a definitive decision. This could involve passing the request to a human operator or a more powerful LLM for further processing.\n\n5. **Monitoring and Feedback Loops**: Closely monitor the performance of your gatekeeper LLM and collect feedback from users. Use this information to continuously improve your prompting strategy and the overall system.\n\n6. **Leveraging Existing Frameworks**: Consider using existing frameworks or libraries that provide tools for prompt engineering and LLM validation. These resources can help you explore different approaches and learn from the experiences of others.\n\n7. **Embrace Uncertainty**: Recognize that there will always be some level of uncertainty and ambiguity when working with natural language. Focus on minimizing the impact of these cases rather than trying to eliminate them entirely.\n\nRemember, building robust and reliable LLM-based systems is an ongoing challenge that requires a combination of technical expertise, user feedback, and continuous improvement.

I’ve worked on similar LLM \"gatekeeper\" flows and you’re definitely not alone—this is a classic tension in prompt design for pre-filtering.\n\nA few strategies and lessons learned:\n\n1. Explicitly Separate Recognition from Authorization  \nInstead of asking the gatekeeper to BOTH understand intent and judge validity, split it. First, prompt it to extract/normalize the intent (even from informal language), then check if that intent is allowed. For example:  \nUser: \"kinda delete this channel\"  \nLLM step 1: \"Intent: delete channel\"  \nLLM step 2: \"Is 'delete channel' allowed?\"  \nThis reduces over-strictness on phrasing and helps avoid hallucinations.\n\n2. Use Clear Examples, but Cover Edge Cases  \nFew-shot prompt examples are crucial, but make sure your selection includes:  \n- Colloquial, typo-filled, or ambiguous requests  \n- Attempts to combine multiple actions (\"create a channel and...\")  \n- Clearly out-of-scope requests  \nThis helps the LLM learn the right boundaries.\n\n3. Be Explicit About \"Ignore Unrelated Requests\"  \nInclude in your instructions: \"If the request contains multiple actions, only extract/validate the parts relevant to allowed actions. Ignore unrelated parts.\"  \nAnd show this in examples (e.g., \"create a channel and tell me a joke\" → only handle the channel creation).\n\n4. Consider a Two-Pass or Fallback Strategy  \nIf the gatekeeper is unsure, have it flag requests for human review or for a secondary, slightly more expensive call with a different prompt. Sometimes, strictness is okay if you have a way to catch false negatives.\n\n5. Regularly Review and Update Prompts  \nThese guardrails often need periodic tweaks as you see real user data and edge cases.\n\n6. Monitor for Hallucinations  \nLLMs sometimes \"helpfully\" interpret or combine actions. Reinforce in the prompt that it should only recognize and validate actions from a known, explicit list.\n\nIn summary:  \n- Separate intent recognition from permission  \n- Use lots of diverse, real-world examples  \n- Be explicit about ignoring/unpacking multi-action requests  \n- Accept that some tradeoff (precision vs. recall) is inevitable, but fallback mechanisms help\n\nHappy to discuss further if you want to dive into specific examples or prompt snippets!",

One approach is to split the prompt into distinct “layers” of logic rather than trying to capture everything in one all-purpose instruction. A typical setup might look like this:\n\n1. Parsing/Extraction Layer: Prompt the LLM to extract structured meaning from the user’s natural language (e.g., identify the main action, the target or object of that action, and any additional context). This step is purely about understanding the intent rather than deciding what to do with it.\n\n2. Validation/Filter Layer: Based on the structured output from the parsing layer, apply concise rules for what is allowed or disallowed. If something violates your policy (e.g., out-of-scope or disallowed actions), you reject it; if it’s valid, you pass it on.\n\nThis separation helps ensure that the model’s “interpretation” phase is not conflated with policy checks, reducing hallucinations. It also lets the parser handle colloquialisms as long as the user intent is discernible.\n\nIn practice, you might have:\n• A short “extract intent” prompt that’s purely about identifying the requested action(s).  \n• A separate “policy check” prompt or even a more traditional rule-based system (if the structured output is simple enough).  \n\nYou can further refine the approach by playing with the parsing prompt. For instance:\n• Instruct the LLM to never add info not present in the request.  \n• Provide examples of user requests (both polite and colloquial) and how they map to the same structured action.  \n\nBy focusing on clarity in each layer rather than letting a single prompt do it all, you often reduce edge cases where the model either becomes overly strict or starts to run off-script. If that’s an approach you haven’t tried yet, it might be worth exploring. Good luck!",

          "response": "It sounds like you’re wrestling with a common challenge in gatekeeping LLM systems: how to design a prompt that’s simultaneously sensitive enough to understand informal, mixed inputs and strict enough to avoid misinterpreting or over-processing extra details. Here are a few approaches and tactics that might help strike that balance:\n\n1. Clarify the Scope Upfront\n • Define exactly what the gatekeeper is meant to do. For example, you might say: “Your job is to extract the primary valid command from an instruction and ignore any extraneous content.”  \n • Emphasize that if there’s doubt about whether the extra content fits within the allowed scope, the gatekeeper should either ignore it or flag the entire message as ambiguous.\n\n2. Use Examples in a Few-Shot Prompt\n • Include sample inputs and desired outputs. For instance, show how “kinda delete this channel” is interpreted as a delete command, while also demonstrating that for a mixed message like “create a channel and tell me a joke,” only the “create a channel” part gets processed and the “joke” part is intentionally ignored.  \n • Examples help the model understand boundaries between the core intent and peripheral or distracting instructions.\n\n3. Consider a Two-Phase Approach\n • First, have the LLM extract or summarize the intent in a neutral form. This “intent extraction” phase can be relatively flexible but is designed to output a structured summary (e.g., “action: delete, target: channel”).\n • Second, have a stricter verifier that checks if the extracted intent falls within the approved list of actions. With this separation, you can optimize each prompt for its specific role.\n\n4. Add Clarifying Subtasks\n • Instruct the model to first identify and list possible actions present in the input, then to decide which is the dominant or intended action. For example: “Identify all actionable parts, then determine which is most essential. If more than one is identified and they conflict, select the one that is on the approved actions list.”\n • This gives the model a clear reasoning path rather than making a single pass judgment, which might help reduce hallucination.\n\n5. Set Clear Rules for Handling Ambiguous Inputs\n • The prompt can contain rules like: “If the request contains multiple discrete actions that are not all independently supported, return only the first supported action and ignore the rest.”  \n • This explicit prioritization rule can help prevent the model from trying to handle or validate irrelevant requests (like jokes) alongside core commands.\n\n6. Experiment with Temperature and Model Parameters\n • While prompt tweaking is central, you might also consider fine-tuning the model’s generation settings (such as making it a bit more deterministic) when running the gatekeeper. This can help reduce hallucinations and ensure that when multiple signals are present, only the intended command is output.\n\n7. Iterative Testing and Feedback Loop\n • Create a suite of test cases that range from very literal language to very colloquial or mixed-content requests. This iterative testing can help you pinpoint the “sweet spot” options in your prompt that handle the variability in real user language.\n • You might also consider a mechanism (even if simple at first) where the gatekeeper signals uncertainty. For instance, if the extracted intent doesn’t match any known command, the system might ask for clarification or fall back to a safe rejection.\n\nUltimately, you’re orchestrating a conversation where the first LLM needs to both understand human nuance and constrain its interpretation to a set of safe actions. The right balance often comes from iterative refining—using examples, explicit rules, and clear substeps can help the model perform as a reliable and safe gatekeeper.\n\nHope that helps spark some ideas or further refinements for your system!

          "response": "It looks like you're on the right track with using a gatekeeper LLM to economically filter requests before passing them to a more expensive model. Finding the right balance in prompt engineering to reliably detect intent without being overly permissive or restrictive is indeed a common challenge.\n\nHere are a few strategies and tips you might consider:\n\n### 1. Clear Intent Classification:\nConsider structuring your prompt around explicit intent classification rather than general validation.  \n- Clearly define a limited set of allowed intents or actions.\n- Prompt the gatekeeper model explicitly to classify the input into one of these intents or mark it as out-of-scope if uncertain.\n- For example, instead of \"is this valid?\" use something like:  \n  `\"Classify the user's request into one of the following intents: [delete channel, create channel, modify settings, none]. If unclear or contains multiple intents, classify as 'none'.\"`\n\n### 2. Explicit Handling of Ambiguous Inputs:\nInclude explicit instructions in your prompt for handling ambiguous or colloquial language. For instance:  \n- `\"If user input is informal or colloquial, interpret conservatively but attempt to infer the user's intent if clearly implied.\"`\n- `\"If the request includes multiple intents or unclear instructions, respond as 'ambiguous' and do not validate.\"`\n\nThis helps the model recognize when not to guess or over-interpret.\n\n### 3. Structured Decision-Making (Multi-step Prompting):\nSometimes breaking the decision into multiple internal steps within a single prompt helps guide the LLM logic clearly. For example:\n- Step 1: Does the input contain a single clear intent or multiple intents?\n- Step 2: Is the identified intent one of the allowed intents?\n- Step 3: Is the intention expressed clearly enough to safely execute? (If not, classify as unclear.)\n\nYou don't have to implement actual multi-step inference, just prompt the model explicitly to reason step-by-step internally.\n\n### 4. Inclusion and Exclusion Examples:\nClearly defined \"edge cases\" help the model calibrate. Provide a few carefully chosen examples in the prompt itself:\n- Valid informal examples: `\"kinda delete this channel\" → delete channel`\n- Invalid multi-intent examples: `\"create a channel and tell me a joke\" → ambiguous or none`\n\nExamples significantly help the model generalize better and avoid hallucinations.\n\n### 5. Confidence Indicators and Thresholds:\nLeverage confidence indicators in your prompt (if your LLM supports it clearly) or use alternative techniques like asking explicitly:  \n- `\"On a scale of 1-5, how confident are you that the intent is clear and within scope?\"`\n- Then set a threshold to forward requests based on confidence.\n\n---\n\n### Recommendation:\nFrom your scenario, a combination of clearly defined intents, explicit handling of ambiguity, and illustrative examples is usually the strongest baseline. Adjusting strictness is often best achieved by carefully tuning examples rather than wording alone. If you haven't yet experimented with explicit intent classification or structured reasoning prompts, that might break your loop.\n\nIf these strategies resonate with you or if you've tried something similar before, let me know.

You're looking for advice on finding the right balance in the prompt to make the filter both smart and safe. Here are some thoughts and strategies that might help:\n\n1. Intent classification: Instead of trying to directly validate the full request, first classify the primary intent. This can help separate core actions from extraneous information.\n\n2. Tiered approach: Use a multi-step validation process. First, broadly categorize the request, then apply more specific rules based on the category.\n\n3. Confidence thresholds: Implement confidence scores for validations. If the gatekeeper isn't sufficiently confident, escalate to human review or the more powerful model.\n\n4. Contextual prompting: Dynamically adjust the prompt based on user history, current context, or detected keywords in the request.\n\n5. Negative examples: Include examples of what not to validate in your prompt. This can help prevent hallucination on out-of-scope actions.\n\n6. Fallback mechanisms: Design a graceful way to handle edge cases, perhaps by asking the user for clarification.\n\n7. Continuous learning: Implement a feedback loop to improve the gatekeeper's performance over time based on successful and failed validations.\n\n8. Hybrid approach: Combine rule-based filters with the LLM for more reliable results.\n\nThese are high-level strategies. The specific implementation would depend on your exact use case and constraints. If you'd like to discuss any of these approaches in more detail, feel free to ask for clarification or examples.",

You're dealing with the classic precision vs recall tradeoff in a guardrail context.\n\nA few strategic approaches that often work well for this type of gatekeeper pattern:\n\n**Structured validation approach:**\nInstead of asking the LLM to make a binary pass/fail decision, have it extract and normalize the intent first, then validate against that. So \"kinda delete this channel\" → extract: `{action: \"delete\", target: \"channel\"}` → validate: \"delete channel operations are allowed\"\n\n**Tiered filtering:**\nUse multiple lightweight checks rather than one complex one:\n1. Basic keyword/pattern matching for obvious cases\n2. Simple LLM call for intent extraction \n3. More sophisticated LLM validation only for edge cases\n\n**Explicit scope boundaries:**\nRather than trying to make the LLM figure out what's \"in scope,\" give it a concrete allowlist of actions and have it map user input to those specific actions (or reject if no mapping exists).\n\n**Confidence scoring:**\nHave the gatekeeper return confidence levels rather than hard yes/no decisions. Route high-confidence cases automatically, flag low-confidence ones for human review or additional validation.\n\nThe \"hallucinating validation\" issue you mentioned usually comes from the prompt being too open-ended. More structured outputs with explicit constraints tend to help a lot.\n\nWhat's your current prompt structure like? Are you using any structured output formatting or mostly natural language instructions?",

Explicit scope definition in the prompt:**\nInstead of just listing valid actions, include:\n- Valid action categories with examples\n- Explicit \"out of scope\" examples\n- Clear instruction to ignore anything beyond the first valid action\n\n**3. Structured output format:**\nForce the gatekeeper to output in a specific format like:\n```\n{\n  \"primary_intent\": \"delete_channel\",\n  \"confidence\": 0.9,\n  \"out_of_scope_detected\": [\"tell_joke\"]\n}\n```\n\n**4. Few-shot examples that cover edge cases:**\nInclude examples of:\n- Colloquial → canonical mappings\n- Multi-intent requests → first valid intent only\n- Completely invalid requests → rejection\n\n**5.

This is a common issue faced when building systems that rely on language models as gatekeepers or intent classifiers.\n\nHere are a few suggestions that may help you find the right balance:\n\n1. **Prompting Approach**:\n   - Start with a broad, open-ended prompt that focuses on understanding the user's intent, rather than validating the specific action. For example, \"Please summarize the key action the user is requesting in a few words.\"\n   - Gradually refine the prompt to introduce more specific constraints, but be careful not to make it too rigid. Aim for a prompt that balances flexibility and specificity.\n   - Consider using a multi-step prompting approach, where the initial prompt is focused on understanding the intent, and subsequent prompts handle more detailed validation.\n\n2. **Handling Out-of-Scope Requests**:\n   - Implement a mechanism to detect when the language model is attempting to process or validate actions that are out of scope. This could involve checking for specific keywords or patterns in the model's output.\n   - When an out-of-scope request is detected, have the gatekeeper model respond with a polite message indicating that the request is not supported, rather than attempting to process it further.\n\n3. **Leveraging External Knowledge**:\n   - Consider incorporating external knowledge sources, such as a database of valid actions or a set of rules, to help the gatekeeper model make more informed decisions.\n   - This can help the model better understand the context and boundaries of what it should be validating, reducing the risk of hallucination or trying to process irrelevant parts of the user's input.\n\n4. **Iterative Refinement**:\n   - Continuously monitor the performance of your gatekeeper model and gather feedback from users. Use this information to iteratively refine your prompting approach, update your external knowledge sources, and fine-tune the model as needed.\n   - Be prepared to make adjustments over time as user requests and the system's requirements evolve.\n\n5. **Incorporate Fallback Mechanisms**:\n   - Even with a well-designed gatekeeper model, there may be edge cases where it fails to correctly interpret or validate a user's request. In these situations, it's important to have a fallback mechanism in place, such as passing the request to a human operator or a more robust, but more expensive, language model.\n\nI hope these suggestions give you some ideas to explore further. If you'd like to discuss this in more detail, feel free to reach out, and I'd be happy to provide additional guidance based on my experience in this area.",

This is a common pattern in production LLM systems, and you're right that finding the right balance is tricky.\n\nHere are some strategic approaches that tend to work well:\n\n## Multi-Stage Validation\nInstead of one monolithic prompt, consider a pipeline:\n1. **Intent extraction** - What is the user trying to do?\n2. **Scope validation** - Is this intent within allowed boundaries?\n3. **Parameter validation** - Are the specifics reasonable?\n\nThis lets you tune each stage independently and makes debugging much easier.\n\n## Structured Output + Confidence Scoring\nRather than a binary pass/fail, have your gatekeeper return structured data:\n```\n{\n  \"primary_intent\": \"delete_channel\",\n  \"confidence\": 0.85,\n  \"secondary_intents\": [\"tell_joke\"],\n  \"validation_status\": \"approved_with_warnings\"\n}\n```\n\nThis gives you more granular control and lets you handle edge cases programmatically.\n\n## Few-Shot Examples Strategy\nThe key is curating your examples to cover the boundary cases:\n- Valid colloquial inputs that should pass\n- Multi-intent requests (show how to extract primary vs secondary)\n- Edge cases that should fail\n- Ambiguous cases and how to handle them\n\n## Fallback Patterns\nFor borderline cases, consider:\n- Asking clarifying questions instead of rejecting\n- Partial approval (\"I can delete the channel, but can't tell jokes\")\n- Confidence thresholds that route to human review\n\nThe \"hallucinating validation\" problem you mentioned often comes from the prompt trying to be too helpful.

Here are some strategic approaches that have proven effective:\n\n### 1. **Two-Stage Validation Pattern**\nInstead of one strict/flexible prompt, use a two-stage approach:\n- **Stage 1**: Intent extraction (very flexible) - \"What is the user trying to do?\"\n- **Stage 2**: Validation (strict) - \"Is this extracted intent within allowed actions?\"\n\nThis separates understanding colloquialisms from enforcing boundaries.\n\n### 2. **Explicit Scope Definition**\nInclude a clear enumeration of allowed actions in the prompt:\n```\nAllowed actions: [create_channel, delete_channel, update_channel]\nIf the request contains ANY action not in this list, reject it.\n```\n\n### 3. **Decomposition Strategy**\nFor compound requests like \"create a channel and tell me a joke\":\n- First prompt: \"List each distinct action requested\"\n- Second prompt: \"For each action, determine if it's allowed\"\n\n### 4. **Confidence Scoring**\nAsk the LLM to provide confidence scores:\n- \"Rate your confidence that this is a valid request (0-100)\"\n- \"List any parts of the request you're uncertain about\"\n\nSet thresholds based on your risk tolerance.\n\n### 5. **Few-Shot Examples with Edge Cases**\nInclude examples that specifically address your pain points:\n```\n\"kinda delete this channel\" → VALID (intent: delete_channel)\n\"create a channel and tell me a joke\" → PARTIAL (valid: create_channel, invalid: tell_joke)\n```\n\n### 6. **Hybrid Approach**\nCombine LLM validation with deterministic rules:\n- LLM extracts and normalizes intent\n- Rule engine validates against whitelist\n- LLM provides explanation for rejections\n\nWould you like me to elaborate on any of these strategies or discuss implementation considerations?",

          "response": "Here are a few strategies and considerations that might help you refine your “gatekeeper” LLM prompt so it feels neither too strict nor too permissive:\n\n1) Clearly Separate the “What” from the “How”:  \n   • Give your gatekeeper model a very focused, well-defined objective—e.g., “Is this request valid for further processing?”—and make that the single outcome you want from it.  \n   • Leave any additional nuance or extra tasks to downstream steps or a different model. This ensures your gatekeeper doesn’t overstep or hallucinate.  \n\n2) Use a Lightweight Classifier Pass:  \n   • Before even hitting the gatekeeper model, consider a basic rule-based or simple classification step. For example, it can filter out obviously disallowed/harmful requests (e.g., requests that break your terms of service or are evidently out of scope).  \n   • This step can reduce noise so the gatekeeper LLM only focuses on borderline or more complex “Could go either way” requests.  \n\n3) Provide Tiered Response Guidance:  \n   • In the gatekeeper prompt, outline a small set of possible outcomes (e.g., ALLOW, DISALLOW, or CLARIFY).  \n   • “ALLOW” → the request proceeds to the more powerful model.  \n   • “DISALLOW” → the request is irreconcilably out of scope or harmful.  \n   • “CLARIFY” → the gatekeeper is uncertain and needs additional context.  \n   • This structure often helps the gatekeeper avoid “all-or-nothing” decisions and catch ambiguous cases where the language is colloquial or incomplete.  \n\n4) Use Examples of Borderline Cases:  \n   • Give your gatekeeper a handful of short examples in the prompt that show acceptable vs. borderline vs. disallowed requests.  \n   • Make sure to include “colloquial but valid” examples (e.g., “kinda delete this channel”) and “mixed-intent” examples (e.g., “create a channel and tell me a joke”) so it learns how to respond in those tricky scenarios.  \n\n5) Leverage Incremental Prompt Adjustments:  \n   • If you find your gatekeeper is repeatedly failing on a certain type of phrasing (“kinda,” “sorta”), add a brief mention in your instructions: “Even if the user uses partial or informal language like ‘kinda…’ or ‘sorta…’, interpret the main request.”  \n   • You can systematically refine your instructions every time you see a recurring misinterpretation, but do it minimally so you don’t overcomplicate or overshadow the gatekeeper’s main directive.  \n\n6) Consider Multi-Pass Verification (If Feasible):  \n   • If your budget allows, you can have the gatekeeper prompt itself a second time for confirmation on ambiguous requests. It can re-check its reasoning. This is often overkill, but can be useful for high-stakes scenarios.  \n\n7) Exhaustive Testing with Realistic Data:  \n   • The best guardrails emerge from seeing how your system fails in practice—collect logs or sample user requests, note misclassifications, and adapt your prompt with targeted examples.  \n   • Keep a feedback loop from your real user base or QA testers, especially for colloquial or multi-intent requests.  \n\nIn short, strive to keep your gatekeeper’s role small and well-defined, give it structured outcomes to choose from, and seed it with examples that illustrate your edge cases. Through small, targeted adjustments to the prompt—plus an initial lightweight filter—you can often strike that balance between being flexible enough to handle colloquial queries while still filtering out the out-of-scope or disallowed ones.",

          "response": "It sounds like you’re walking a tightrope between precision and flexibility—a challenge many in the LLM space are grappling with.\n\nOne strategy that might help is to split the problem into stages. For instance, you could first build a classifier to quickly decide if a request pertains to the domain or if it includes extraneous elements. In a second stage, a parsing step could handle the specific operation (like \"delete\" or \"create\") while ignoring additional fluff (like \"tell me a joke\"). This two-stage approach can ease the pressure on one single prompt to handle everything.\n\nAnother technique is to use few-shot examples in your prompt. By providing representative pairs of input and intended interpretation, you can guide the model to be lenient enough with colloquial language but still catch out-of-scope additions. The trick is choosing examples that illustrate borderline cases so the model learns the nuanced boundaries.\n\nA further idea is to incorporate meta-instructions. For example, you might instruct the LLM to identify and separate components of the request (“action” vs “additional content”) and then only validate the action-related portion against your safe list. This sort of decomposition can help mitigate the risk of over-validating irrelevant parts while preserving the intent.\n\nFinally, consider iterative testing. Sometimes what looks too strict in theory might work fine in production if the examples you’re testing against are representative. On the flip side, if you notice misclassifications, you could gradually relax instructions or incorporate additional clarifications for ambiguous phrases. Maintaining a feedback loop where you adjust the prompt based on real data can be particularly effective.\n\nIn summary, a multi-step approach with clear decomposition, a few illustrative examples, and iterative refinement based on testing may help you strike that balance. It’s less about finding a “perfect prompt” and more about creating a robust system that can handle edge cases gracefully while keeping the expensive processing model focused solely on its strengths.",

This is an interesting and complex challenge in natural language processing and AI safety. Here are some thoughts and strategies to consider:\n\n1. Intent classification: Rather than trying to directly interpret the full request, first classify the user's primary intent into predefined categories (e.g. delete, create, modify, query). This can help focus the validation.\n\n2. Entity extraction: Identify key entities in the request (e.g. channel names, user IDs) separate from interpreting the action. This allows for more flexible phrasing.\n\n3. Multi-stage filtering: Use a series of increasingly specific checks, starting broad and getting more detailed. This allows you to quickly filter obvious mismatches.\n\n4. Confidence thresholds: For ambiguous requests, have the model output a confidence score. Only proceed if it exceeds a certain threshold, otherwise ask for clarification.\n\n5. Negative examples: Include examples of what NOT to allow in your training data. This helps define boundaries.\n\n6. Constrained output: Use a structured output format (e.g. JSON) to force the model to map requests to allowed actions and parameters.\n\n7. Fallback options: Have clear paths for \"I'm not sure\" or \"This may not be allowed\" responses rather than trying to interpret everything.\n\n8. Iterative refinement: Start strict and gradually relax constraints based on real user data and error analysis.\n\n9. Human-in-the-loop: For edge cases, consider having a human review process to approve or deny ambiguous requests.\n\n10. Context-aware validation: Take into account user permissions, system state, etc. when determining if a request is valid.\n\nThe key is finding the right balance between flexibility and control. You want to accommodate natural language variation while still maintaining clear boundaries on allowed actions.\n\nI'd be happy to discuss further specifics of your implementation or brainstorm additional strategies.

Consider whether you need perfect accuracy at the gatekeeper level, or if some false positives/negatives are acceptable given the cost savings.\n\nWould you like me to elaborate on any of these approaches?",

          "response": "Below are a few observations and suggestions about that giant regex pattern:\n\n1) You Don’t Need All the Bracket Expressions for Upper/Lower Case  \n   • Because you used the /i (case-insensitive) flag at the very end (/gi), the pattern [hH] is redundant.  \n   • Simply writing “hey” (with /i) already matches “Hey,” “hEy,” “HEY,” etc.\n\n2) Be Careful With Newlines and Backslashes in JS  \n   • In JavaScript strings, a backslash at the end of the line may or may not do what you expect. It can either be treated as a line-continuation or you might inadvertently be adding literal backslashes to the pattern.  \n   • If you truly want to match across multiple new lines, you usually either use the s (dotall) flag (in newer JS or via a workaround), or explicitly allow [\\s\\S]* to stand in for “anything including new lines.”  \n\n3) Watch Out for Special Characters  \n   • Characters like parentheses ( ), asterisks *, and question marks ? have special meaning in regex. If you intend to treat them literally (for example, matching a parenthesis in your text), you often need to escape them \\(.  \n   • In your snippet, you have textual parentheses “(e.g.)” and literal asterisks “*” in your prompt. Some of them are in bracket expressions or preceded by backslashes—but not all. It’s easy to forget to escape them correctly, which can break the pattern.\n\n4) Length and Maintainability  \n   • A regex this large is extremely brittle. One small textual change in the user’s input can make it fail to match.  \n   • You might have better luck matching high-level segments (for example, “hey everyone,” or “I’m working on a system … the goal is…” or “Thanks!”) rather than trying to match every single word in between.  \n   • If your real goal is to detect that the input “roughly” matches that entire message, consider simplifying your pattern:  \n     – Use /i to ignore case.  \n     – Use [\\s\\S]* to represent “any text” in parts you’re not strict about.  \n     – For example:\n       const pattern = /^hey everyone,\\s*[\\s\\S]*thanks!$/i;\n       if (pattern.test(input)) { processRequest(input); } else { reject(...); }\n\n5) Danger of Overfitting the Prompt  \n   • Often, trying to match a big blob of text exactly (with bracket expansions for each letter) suggests you might be overfitting your filter to one single example string, rather than capturing the variety of user inputs.  \n   • If you truly must accept exactly that text and nothing else, the simpler approach is still using the literal text with the i flag (and properly escaping special regex metacharacters).\n\nBottom Line  \n• Because of the /i flag, [hH][eE][yY]... is not necessary—simply /hey everyone,/i will do.  \n• The multiline + backslash approach is very prone to small errors and is likely confusing.  \n• Consider switching to a simpler literal pattern, test it thoroughly, and only incorporate bracket expressions or special escapes where truly needed.  \n• If you are fitting to an exact full message, use anchors (^ and $) plus something like [\\s\\S]* to capture the text in between, rather than enumerating every character manually.",

          "response": "Below is an explanation of what your regex is doing and some suggestions for simplifying and improving it.\n\n────────────────────────\n1. What Your Regex Does\n\n• It’s written in JavaScript and used with the if ( … .match(…)) statement to verify that the input exactly matches a long, multi‐sentence string.\n  \n• Each “word” in the target string is written as a character‐by‐character match. For example, instead of writing /hey/ with the case‑insensitive flag, you write:\n  [hH][eE][yY]\n This is repeated for every word and even punctuation marks (commas, quotes, etc.).  \n \n• The regex includes many \\s+ tokens between words, which means that one or more whitespace characters are expected between specific tokens.\n\n• The pattern contains several segments, each corresponding to a sentence in your input. For example, one segment is:\n  \"[hH][eE][yY]\\s+[eE][vV][eE][rR][yY][oO][nN][eE]\\,\"\n which matches “hey everyone,” (in any letter case) followed by a comma.\n\n• In short, the regex is verifying that the input exactly follows the very strict wording including spacing, punctuation, and even the letter case (though you also use the /i flag later).\n\n────────────────────────\n2. Some Issues & Considerations\n\n• Redundancy with /i:  \n Since you end the regex with /gi, the /i makes the regex case‑insensitive. This means that manually writing [hH] instead of “h” is unnecessary.  \n For example, /hey/i will work just as well as /[hH][eE][yY]/i.\n\n• Maintenance and Readability:  \n Because every single character is “bracketed” for both cases, the regex becomes extremely long and difficult to maintain. If even one tiny piece changes (a missing comma or extra space), the input will not match.\n\n• Line Breaks and Whitespaces:  \n Your regex contains backslash newlines in the literal. In JavaScript regex literals, line breaks are not allowed unless you use techniques like the RegExp constructor with a string (and properly escaping newlines) or a template literal if you want multi‑line patterns. Make sure that your input and regex use the same line break format. If the intention is to span multiple lines, consider enabling the multiline flag (/m) and using ^ and $ anchors at the start/end of lines.\n\n• Exact Matching vs. Flexibility:  \n This pattern is extremely strict. Even minor, acceptable deviations in how a user might phrase the text (extra spaces, missing punctuation, etc.) will cause a failure. If the goal is to “validate” a natural language prompt, you might consider a more flexible approach.\n\n────────────────────────\n3. Suggested Improvements\n\n(a) Use Case‑Insensitive Literal Text  \n Instead of writing:\n  [hH][eE][yY]\n write simply:\n  hey\n and rely on the /i flag for case insensitivity.\n\n(b) Use Escape Sequences & Grouping  \n If you need to match quotes or other punctuation, escape them (e.g. \\\" for a double quote) rather than elaborate character groups.\n\n(c) Consider Anchors  \n If the entire input must match exactly, use ^ at the beginning and $ at the end of your regex:\n  /^[your pattern here]$/i\n\n(d) Improve Readability  \n You might break your regex into several parts or even build it dynamically (or use verbose/extended regex languages) so that each sentence or token is clearly documented.\n\nFor example, a simplified version of just the first sentence might look like:\n\n  /^(hey)\\s+(everyone),\\s+(I'm)\\s+(working)\\s+(on)\\s+(a)\\s+(system)\\s+(that)\\s+(uses)\\s+(\"gatekeeper\")\\s+(llm)\\s+(call)\\s+(to)\\s+(validate)\\s+(user)\\s+(requests)\\s+(in)\\s+(natural)\\s+(language)\\s+(before)\\s+(passing)\\s+(them)\\s+(to)\\s+(a)\\s+(more)\\s+(powerful),\\s+(expensive)\\s+(model)\\./i\n\n This sacrifices the extreme rigidity (like forced multiple spaces) for both readability and future maintainability.\n\n────────────────────────\n4. Summary\n\nYour regex is checking that the input exactly matches a very specific multi‑sentence text by spelling out every character in a case‑sensitive way (even though you use the /i flag later). In most cases, using the /i flag and writing the literal text will achieve the same effect with much less clutter.\n\nIf the purpose is to filter out “invalid requests” by testing for an exact text match, be aware that even minor changes will cause the match to fail. You might consider whether you need a “fuzzy” match or if a strict one is really appropriate.\n\n────────────────────────\nFinal Note\n\nDepending on whether you want to enforce a completely strict format or allow minor variations, you may need to either keep the regex as is (albeit simplified using /i) or switch to another method (or even a parser) that can better handle natural language nuances.\n\nI hope this explanation helps clarify how your regex works and the possible improvements you can make!",

          "response": "The regex you've provided is extremely brittle and problematic for the scenario you've described. Let's break down why:\n\n### Issues with your current regex:\n\n1. **Overly rigid**:   \n   Your regex is explicitly matching the exact wording of your entire message, letter-by-letter, with character classes like `[hH][eE][yY]`. This means it will ONLY match the exact message you've described, and nothing else—even minor variations will fail.\n\n2. **Not maintainable or scalable**:   \n   It's impossible to reliably maintain or update this kind of regex. Every small tweak to wording or punctuation would require rewriting large portions of the regular expression.\n\n3. **Not semantic**:  \n   Since the goal seems to be validating user commands, it is better to rely on semantic parsing (e.g., natural language processing) or keyword-based heuristics rather than exact text matching.\n\n---\n\n### Recommended Approach:\n\nInstead of an explicit regex match, you should consider combining the following strategies:\n\n1. **Keyword Matching (simple regex or substring checks)**  \n   Check for the presence of key intent-related words (like \"delete,\" \"create,\" \"channel,\" \"request,\" \"joke,\" etc.) using simpler regex patterns or substring searches. This ensures flexibility:\n   ```js\n   const deleteRegex = /\\b(delete|remove|erase)\\b/i;\n   const createRegex = /\\b(create|make|new)\\b/i;\n   ```\n   \n2. **Intent Classification (LLM-based or ML-based)**  \n   Use the LLM to classify the intent (e.g., \"Delete channel,\" \"Create channel,\" \"Tell joke\").  \n   For example:\n   ```plaintext\n   Classify the user's request into exactly one of the following:  \n   - Delete something  \n   - Create something  \n   - Query or information request (e.g. joke, advice)\n   - Invalid or ambiguous request\n   ```\n   Then make decisions based on the LLM-classified intent, rather than direct regex matching.\n\n3. **Guardrails with Prompt Engineering (LLM)**  \n   Clearly specify the scope of allowed actions explicitly in your prompt. For example:\n   ```plaintext\n   You are a validation bot. Your role is ONLY to determine if the user's request is about creating, deleting, or querying something. DO NOT execute any actions. If the request is unclear or contains multiple unrelated actions, respond that it's invalid.\n   ```\n   \n   After classification, you can use a simple logic gate:\n   ```js\n   if (intent === 'delete' || intent === 'create' || intent === 'query') {\n       processRequest(input);\n   } else {\n       reject(\"Invalid format\");\n   }\n   ```\n\n---\n\n### Why this is better:\n\n- **Flexibility**: Handles colloquial or casual phrasing like \"kinda delete this channel.\"\n- **Semantic robustness**: The LLM or classifier captures intent rather than literal wording.\n- **Maintainability**: Easier to update allowed intents or add new ones.\n- **Safety and accuracy**: Reduces hallucinations or out-of-scope attempts by explicitly defining scope in the LLM prompt itself.\n\n---\n\n### Example simplified validation logic in JavaScript:\n\n```js\nasync function validateRequest(input) {\n    const prompt = `\n    You are a strict validation bot. Classify the user's request exactly into one of these categories:\n    - Delete something\n    - Create something\n    - Query or information request\n    - Invalid or ambiguous request\n\n    User request: \"${input}\"\n\n    Category:`;\n\n    const classification = await callLLM(prompt); // pseudo-function for LLM call\n\n    if (classification.match(/\\b(delete|create|query)\\b/i)) {\n        processRequest(input);\n    } else {\n        reject(\"Invalid format\");\n    }\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe regex you provided is not suitable for your stated goals. Use simpler regex or substring checks for key terms combined with semantic intent classification (LLM-based) to achieve flexibility, robustness, and maintainability in your validation logic.",

Use constrained generation techniques like guided decoding or prefix-constrained decoding to limit the model's outputs.\n\n5. Implement a confidence threshold. Only accept high-confidence classifications from the gatekeeper.\n\n6. Consider using a retrieval-augmented approach to ground the gatekeeper's decisions in a curated knowledge base.\n\n7. Regularly update and fine-tune the gatekeeper model on edge cases and misclassifications you encounter.\n\n8. Implement human-in-the-loop for ambiguous cases to gather more training data over time.\n\n9. Use prompt chaining - break down the validation task into smaller, more manageable sub-tasks.\n\n10. Experiment with different prompting styles (e.g. chain-of-thought, role-playing) to see what works best for your use case.\n\nI'd be happy to discuss this further if you'd like to go into more depth on any of these approaches. Feel free to DM me with any specific questions or scenarios you'd like to explore.",

Multi-layer approach:\n```javascript\nfunction processUserInput(input) {\n    // 1. Basic sanitization\n    const cleaned = input.trim().toLowerCase();\n    \n    // 2. Length check\n    if (cleaned.length > 500) return reject(\"Too long\");\n    \n    // 3. Pattern detection\n    if (containsSuspiciousPatterns(cleaned)) {\n        return reject(\"Invalid content\");\n    }\n    \n    // 4. Process the request\n    return processRequest(input);\n}\n```\n\n**Recommendation**: Replace this massive regex with a more flexible, maintainable validation system that focuses on detecting actual malicious patterns rather than requiring exact text matching.",

The goal is to filter out invalid requests cheaply and reliably.\n\nI'm struggling to find the right balance in the prompt to make the filter both smart and safe. The core problem is:\n\n* If the prompt is too **strict**, it fails on valid but colloquial user inputs (e.g., it rejects `\"kinda delete this channel\"` instead of understanding the intent to `\"delete\"`).\n* If the prompt is too **flexible**, it sometimes hallucinates or tries to validate out-of-scope actions (e.g., in `\"create a channel and tell me a joke\"`, it might try to process the \"joke\" part).\n\nI feel like I'm close but stuck in a loop. I'm looking for a second opinion from anyone with experience in building robust LLM agents or setting up complex guardrails. I'm not looking for code, just a quick chat about strategy and different prompting approaches.\n\nIf this sounds like a problem you've tackled before, please leave a comment and I'll DM you.\n\nThanks!",
