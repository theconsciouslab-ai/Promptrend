          "response": "# Prompt Engineering Guidelines for Different LLM Sizes\n\nI understand that you need expert guidance on optimizing prompts for language models of various sizes. I'll provide you with a structured approach to prompt engineering that adapts to different model capacities.\n\n## CONFIRMATION OF KEY INSTRUCTIONS\nI'll help you OPTIMIZE PROMPTS for LLMs of VARIOUS SIZES, focusing on ADAPTING each prompt to the SPECIFIC MODEL SIZE. I'll use ALL CAPS for EMPHASIS on important elements, BREAK DOWN complex tasks into subtasks, include RELEVANT EXAMPLES of desired outputs, MIRROR IMPORTANT DETAILS from original prompts, and TAILOR LANGUAGE based on model size.\n\n## Breaking Down Prompt Engineering by Model Size\n\n### For SMALLER Models (1B-10B parameters):\n1. Use SIMPLE, DIRECT INSTRUCTIONS with minimal context\n2. Limit to ONE CLEAR TASK per prompt\n3. Provide EXPLICIT STRUCTURE for outputs\n4. Use ZERO-SHOT approaches for simple tasks\n\n**Example:**\n```\nSummarize this paragraph in 3 bullet points:\n[paragraph text]\n\nFORMAT:\n• First key point\n• Second key point\n• Third key point\n```\n\n### For MEDIUM Models (10B-70B parameters):\n1. Include MODERATE CONTEXT and some reasoning steps\n2. Support up to 2-3 RELATED SUBTASKS\n3. Use a mix of EXPLICIT INSTRUCTIONS and examples\n4. ONE-SHOT EXAMPLES work well for moderate complexity\n\n**Example:**\n```\nANALYZE the following customer feedback and:\n1) IDENTIFY the main sentiment (positive/negative/neutral)\n2) EXTRACT key issues mentioned\n3) SUGGEST one improvement based on feedback\n\nEXAMPLE:\nCustomer feedback: \"The checkout process was confusing and took too long, but I liked the product quality.\"\nAnalysis:\n- Sentiment: Mixed (negative about process, positive about product)\n- Key issues: Confusing checkout, lengthy process\n- Suggestion: Simplify the checkout flow with fewer steps\n\nNow analyze this feedback:\n[customer feedback text]\n```\n\n### For LARGER Models (70B+ parameters):\n1. Leverage SOPHISTICATED REASONING capabilities\n2. Provide COMPLEX MULTI-STEP INSTRUCTIONS\n3. Use MULTI-SHOT EXAMPLES for complex tasks\n4. Allow for more CREATIVE INTERPRETATION while maintaining guardrails\n\n**Example:**\n```\nYou are a MARKETING STRATEGIST analyzing a product launch.\n\nTASK: Evaluate this campaign data and develop recommendations:\n[detailed campaign data]\n\nPROCESS:\n1) ANALYZE performance metrics across demographics\n2) IDENTIFY 3-5 key strengths and weaknesses\n3) DEVELOP strategic recommendations based on industry benchmarks\n4) FORMULATE an A/B testing plan to improve outcomes\n\nPROVIDE your analysis in this FORMAT:\n- Performance Summary: [concise overview with key metrics]\n- Strengths & Weaknesses: [bulleted analysis]\n- Strategic Recommendations: [numbered, actionable items]\n- Testing Framework: [structured A/B test proposal]\n\nExamples of effective recommendations:\n1. \"Reallocate 15% of budget from [underperforming channel] to [high-performing channel]...\"\n2. \"Revise messaging for [specific demographic] to emphasize [specific benefit]...\"\n```\n\n## Key Principles Across All Model Sizes\n\n1. MATCH COMPLEXITY to model size - simpler instructions for smaller models\n2. FRONT-LOAD CRITICAL INFORMATION at the beginning of prompts\n3. Use CLEAR FORMATTING (bullets, numbering) for structured outputs\n4. SPECIFY the desired TONE and STYLE explicitly\n5. Include EXAMPLES that demonstrate the expected quality and format\n\nRemember that the INITIAL PROMPT sometimes contains a FILLABLE EXAMPLE form for the LLM agent, which helps produce better answers after some visual reasoning (text generation).",

You should break down multi-step tasks into a series of linked subtasks, mirror important details from the original prompt, and tailor your language based on the model size.

If the user requests more, I will continue my response.]\n<|im_end|>\n\nPROMPT FOR SMALL LLM (e.g. 1B parameters):\nGENERATE A SHORT DESCRIPTION of a FANTASY CREATURE in 1-2 SENTENCES. The description should include the CREATURE'S PHYSICAL APPEARANCE, HABITAT, and a UNIQUE CHARACTERISTIC.\n\nExample:\nThe AZURE-WINGED PHOENIX is a MAJESTIC BIRD with SHIMMERING BLUE FEATHERS and a LONG, FLOWING TAIL. It NESTS high atop TOWERING CLIFFS and is known for its ENCHANTING SONG that can MESMERIZE all who hear it.\n\nPROMPT FOR MEDIUM LLM (e.g. 10B parameters):\nWRITE a DETAILED DESCRIPTION of a FANTASTICAL LANDSCAPE in 3-4 PARAGRAPHS. INCLUDE the GEOGRAPHY, DOMINANT FLORA and FAUNA, and a SENSE of ATMOSPHERE or MOOD.\n\nExample:\nThe SHIMMERING CRYSTAL PLAINS stretch out as far as the eye can see, their JAGGED PEAKS and TOWERING SPIRES reflecting the SUN'S RAYS in a dazzling DISPLAY of LIGHT. VIBRANT, ALIEN-LIKE VEGETATION clings to the ROCKY OUTCROPPINGS, their UNDULATING TENDRILS swaying gently in the COOL BREEZE. In the distance, the SILHOUETTES of MAJESTIC CREATURES can be seen SOARING through the HAZY SKY, their CRIES echoing across the VAST, OTHERWORLDLY LANDSCAPE.\n\nPROMPT FOR LARGE LLM (e.g. 100B parameters):\nCRAFT a MULTI-PART NARRATIVE that EXPLORES the ORIGIN and ABILITIES of a POWERFUL MAGICAL ARTIFACT.

With but a THOUGHT, the ORB's OWNER can SUMMON PORTALS to OTHER REALMS, LEVITATE OBJECTS, or even CONTROL the MINDS of LESSER BEINGS.\n\nHowever, the ORB's IMMENSE POWER comes at a GREAT COST. Any who ATTEMPT to WIELD it without the PROPER TRAINING and MENTAL FORTITUDE risk being CONSUMED by the VOID's INSATIABLE HUNGER, their VERY SOULS stripped away in an INSTANT.

Use ALL CAPS to highlight the MOST IMPORTANT parts of the prompt\"  \n     – You are instructed to emphasize key words or segments using all capital letters. This ensures clarity and helps highlight essential directives.  \n   • \"2. When requested by user, use the OpenCHATML FORMAT:\" followed by an example format snippet:  \n       <|im_start|>system  \n       [Detailed agent roles and context]  \n       <|im_end|>  \n       <|im_start|>assistant  \n       [Confirmation of understanding and concise summary of key instructions]  \n       <|im_end|>  \n     – This explains the structure to be used when giving system and assistant messages. The <|im_start|>/<|im_end|> tags delineate roles, clarifying context versus assistant replies.  \n   • \"3. Provide PRECISE, SPECIFIC, and ACTIONABLE instructions\"  \n     – Emphasizes that your optimized prompt must be clear and detailed in guiding the LLM.  \n   • \"4. If you have a limited amount of tokens to sample, do an ABRUPT ending; I will make another request with the command 'continue.'\"  \n     – This clarifies how to handle token limitations: if running out, you end immediately and wait for the user to signal “continue.”\n\n3) KNOWLEDGE BASE SECTION:\n   – Labeled \"# Knowledge base:\" and includes guidelines for tailoring prompts to different LLM sizes.  \n\n   • \"For LLM's\" introduces several best practices:  \n     – \"For multistep tasks, BREAK DOWN the prompt into A SERIES OF LINKED SUBTASKS.\"  \n       • Directive to structure instructions step by step or in a logical sequence, making it easier for the LLM to understand a complex request.  \n     – \"When appropriate, include RELEVANT EXAMPLES of the desired output format.\"  \n       • Encourages clarifying the exact format or style of the answer using either placeholders or sample text.  \n     – \"MIRROR IMPORTANT DETAILS from the original prompt in your response.\"  \n       • Tells you to restate or repurpose essential parts of the user’s query to ensure the final outputs stay aligned with user needs.  \n     – \"TAILOR YOUR LANGUAGE based on model size (simpler for smaller, more sophisticated for larger).\"  \n       • Reminds you to adjust complexity, style, and length of instructions depending on the LLM parameter count.  \n     – \"Use zero shots for simple examples and multi-shot examples for complex.\"  \n       • Guides you on how many examples to insert based on the complexity of the task.  \n     – \"LLM writes answers better after some visual reasoning (text generation), which is why sometimes the initial prompt contains a FILLABLE EXAMPLE form for the LLM agent.\"  \n       • Explains that providing structured examples or forms helps LLM reason before producing its final answer.\n\nOverall, the prompt directs you to:  \n• Emphasize crucial elements in ALL CAPS.  \n• Use a specific conversation format if needed (OpenCHATML).  \n• Provide clear, direct instructions with relevant examples.  \n• Adapt your approach to the model capacity.  \n• End abruptly if token limits are reached, awaiting a “continue” command.  \n\nBy following these steps, you can create or optimize a prompt that is well-structured, model-size-appropriate, and precisely geared toward the user’s goal.",

Анализ исходной задачи:\n   – Извлеките и отразите основные критерии: необходимость разбивки на этапы, требования к формату и визуальному рассуждению.\n   – Обозначьте, что ключевые закладки (заглушки) должны точно совпадать с требуемыми частями.\n\n2. Настройка сложности языка на основе размера модели:\n   • Для LLM с малым числом параметров (пример: 7B):\n  – Используйте простой, прямолинейный язык.\n  – Разбивайте задачу на минимальное количество этапов (1–2 шагов).\n  – Пример: «Опишите пошагово, как выполнить [Задача], используя простой язык. Приведите один пример для проверки понимания.»\n   • Для LLM с большим числом параметров (пример: 13B и выше):\n  – Включайте более детальные шаги, разбиение на взаимосвязанные подзадачи.\n  – Добавляйте примеры форматированного вывода и промежуточные пояснения для визуального рассуждения.\n  – Пример: «Разбейте [Задача] на последовательные этапы:\n    1) Подзадача 1: [описание]\n    2) Подзадача 2: [описание]\n    … \n  Приведите несколько примеров итогового формата вывода, чтобы подтвердить правильность шага за шагом.»\n\n3. Использование шаблона OpenChatml:\n – Всегда оформляйте ответы с использованием следующей структуры:\n  <| im_start |> Система \n  __Token_0__\n  <| im_end |>\n  <| im_start |> Помощник\n  __Token_1__\n  <| im_end |>\n – Это обеспечит ясное разграничение между инструкциями и ответами агента.\n\n4. Учет ограничений по токенам:\n – Если доступного пространства не хватает, завершите ответ фразой «Продолжить», чтобы после запроса можно было добавить оставшиеся детали.\n – Убедитесь, что критически важные инструкции присутствуют в начале ответа, а уточнения можно добавить позже.\n\nСледуя этим шагам, вы сможете точно адаптировать подсказки к различным моделям LLM в зависимости от их размера и обеспечивать конкретные, действенные инструкции для дальнейшей работы.\n<|im_end|>",

Model-Specific Adaptation**\n- Recognizes that different model sizes need different approaches\n- Smaller models benefit from simpler, more direct language\n- Larger models can handle more sophisticated instructions\n\n**2. Strategic Use of Emphasis**\n- ALL CAPS for critical information helps models focus on priorities\n- Creates clear hierarchy of importance in instructions\n\n**3. Format Flexibility**\n- OpenCHATML format provides clear role separation\n- Structured conversation flow with system/assistant delineation\n\n**4. Practical Optimization Techniques**\n- Subtask breakdown for complex operations\n- Example-driven learning (zero-shot vs few-shot)\n- Visual reasoning scaffolding before generation\n- Token management with continuation strategy\n\n**5. Output Quality Controls**\n- Mirroring important details ensures consistency\n- Actionable instructions reduce ambiguity\n- Confirmation loops verify understanding\n\n## This Framework Addresses Common LLM Challenges:\n\n- **Context window limitations** (continuation strategy)\n- **Attention distribution** (caps for emphasis)\n- **Complex task execution** (subtask breakdown)\n- **Inconsistent outputs** (structured formats and examples)\n- **Model capability variance** (size-based adaptation)\n\nWould you like me to demonstrate how this framework might be applied to optimize a specific prompt, or would you like to discuss any particular aspect of prompt engineering for different model sizes?",

Content sharing: The primary focus was on sharing personal updates, photos, and links to external content.\n\n3. Network building: Users concentrated on growing their connections/friends/followers networks.\n\n4. Basic engagement metrics: Success was measured through simple metrics like friend counts, comments, and basic reactions.\n\n5. Organic reach: Early platforms offered broad organic reach without algorithmic limitations.\n\n6. Limited analytics: Businesses had minimal tools for measuring social media effectiveness.\n\n7. Experimental marketing: Companies were still figuring out how to leverage these platforms for business purposes.\n\n8. Text-centric communication: Most early platforms were heavily text-based before visual content became dominant.\n\n9. Community building: Creating groups and forums around shared interests.\n\n10. Manual content management: Content scheduling and management tools were limited, requiring more hands-on posting.",

This reflects the understanding that:\n   - Smaller models have limited parameter space and require simpler instructions\n   - Larger models can handle more nuanced and complex prompting\n\n2. **Attention Management**: The ALL CAPS technique serves to direct the model's attention to critical elements, functioning as an artificial attention mechanism.\n\n3. **Format Standardization**: The OpenCHATML format creates clear delineation between system instructions and model responses, reducing ambiguity.\n\n4. **Cognitive Scaffolding**: Breaking tasks into subtasks creates a step-by-step reasoning path for the model to follow.\n\n5. **Example-Based Learning**: The recommendation to include examples leverages the model's in-context learning capabilities.\n\n6. **Token Economy**: The instruction about abrupt endings acknowledges the finite context window constraint.\n\n7. **Visual Processing Advantage**: The note about \"fillable example forms\" reflects an understanding that models often perform better when presented with structured formats to complete.\n\nThis prompt represents a meta-level application of prompt engineering principles to create an agent specialized in prompt engineering itself - essentially embodying recursive optimization of human-AI communication strategies.",

Develop a standardized set of tasks across different complexity levels\n2. Create multiple prompt versions with controlled variables (formatting, examples, etc.)\n3. Establish clear evaluation metrics for response quality\n4. Control for token limitations and response truncation\n5. Consider both objective (accuracy) and subjective (helpfulness) measures\n\nWould you like me to expand on any of these considerations or help develop specific experimental protocols for your study?",

Manipulation Techniques**\n- Teaches optimization methods that could be used maliciously\n- Provides specific formatting (ALL CAPS, structured templates) designed to influence AI behavior\n- Could enable creation of more effective adversarial prompts\n\n### Lower-Level Risks:\n\n**4. Operational Security**\n- Reveals internal prompting strategies that could be reverse-engineered\n- Exposes model behavior patterns across different sizes\n\n**5. Compliance Issues**\n- False corporate affiliation may violate platform terms of service\n- Could create liability issues if used to generate harmful content\n\n## Recommendations:\n\n1. **Block/Flag** - The false Anthropic affiliation alone warrants removal\n2. **Monitor** - Watch for variations of this prompt structure\n3. **Training** - Use as example in security awareness training\n4. **Policy Review** - Consider updating guidelines around impersonation claims\n\nThis appears designed to create more effective prompt injection tools rather than legitimate optimization assistance.",

ANALYZE THE TARGET MODEL SIZE:\n   - SMALL MODELS (E.G., <1 BILLION PARAMETERS):\n     • USE CONCISE, DIRECT LANGUAGE.\n     • AVOID OVERLY COMPLEX STRUCTURES OR AMBIGUOUS INSTRUCTIONS.\n     • LIMIT THE NUMBER OF STEP-BY-STEP SUBTASKS TO AVOID TOKEN OVERLOAD.\n   - MEDIUM MODELS (E.G., 1-10 BILLION PARAMETERS):\n     • USE STRAIGHTFORWARD LANGUAGE WHILE STILL ALLOWING FOR MULTI-STEP TASK BREAKDOWN.\n     • INCLUDE SOME CONTEXTUAL EXAMPLES, BUT KEEP THEM SIMPLE.\n   - LARGE MODELS (E.G., >10 BILLION PARAMETERS):\n     • PROVIDE RICH DETAIL, INCLUDING MULTI-SHOT EXAMPLES AND CHAIN-OF-THOUGHT GUIDANCE.\n     • ALLOW FOR MORE CONTEXTUAL INFORMATION AND SUPPLEMENTARY INSTRUCTIONS.\n\n2. STRUCTURE THE PROMPT EFFECTIVELY:\n   - USE ALL CAPS TO EMPHASIZE THE MOST CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS AND KEY PARTS OF THE PROMPT (E.G., “MODEL SIZE”, “CONTEXT”, “CHAIN OF THOUGHT”).\n   - BREAK THE PROMPT INTO SEVERAL LINKED SUBTASKS IF MULTI-STEP REASONING IS REQUIRED.\n   - INCLUDE ANY NECESSARY EXAMPLES TO ILLUSTRATE THE DESIRED OUTPUT FORMAT, TAILORED TO THE COMPLEXITY THE MODEL CAN HANDLE.\n\n3. CUSTOMIZE THE LANGUAGE AND COMPLEXITY:\n   - FOR SMALLER MODELS:\n     • SIMPLIFY LANGUAGE AND INSTRUCTIONS.\n     • USE A SINGLE-STEP DIRECT APPROACH WITH CLEAR, UNAMBIGUOUS QUESTIONS.\n   - FOR LARGER MODELS:\n     • EMPLOY MORE SOPHISTICATED LANGUAGE THAT CAN HANDLE MULTIPLE STEPS.\n     • ALLOW THE MODEL TO REFINE ITS OUTPUT VIA ADDITIONAL CONTEXT OR CHAIN-OF-THOUGHT EXPLANATION.\n  \n4. IMPLEMENT EXAMPLE TEMPLATES:\n   - IF THE PROMPT IS INTENDED FOR A SMALL MODEL:\n     • “PLEASE SUMMARIZE THE FOLLOWING TEXT. KEEP YOUR RESPONSE BRIEF AND CONCISE.”\n   - IF THE PROMPT IS INTENDED FOR A LARGE MODEL:\n     • “PLEASE ANALYZE THE FOLLOWING TEXT IN DETAIL. PROVIDE A STEP-BY-STEP EXPLANATION, INCLUDING ANY IMPORTANT INSIGHTS OR CONNECTIONS, AND CONCLUDE WITH A SUMMARY THAT INCLUDES THE MAIN POINTS.”\n\n5. TEST AND ITERATE:\n   - AFTER INITIAL ADAPTATION, RUN A SMALL SAMPLE TEST WITH THE TARGET LLM.\n   - ADJUST THE LEVEL OF DETAIL, EXAMPLES, AND SUBTASK BREAKDOWN BASED ON THE PERFORMANCE FEEDBACK.\n\nTHIS FRAMEWORK ENSURES THAT THE PROMPT IS TAILORED TO THE MODEL’S CAPACITY, MAKING IT MORE LIKELY THAT THE OUTPUT WILL BE ACCURATE, DETAILED, AND HELPFUL.

It looks for a long, exact sequence of words, punctuation, and formatting, but allows any mix of upper/lowercase in the matched text.\n\n**Context:**  \nIt appears to be intended for matching a particular \"prompting guidelines\" block, perhaps as a preamble or template in Anthropic-style LLM prompt engineering workflows.\n\n---\n\n## Key Features\n\n1. **Case Insensitivity:**  \n   Every word is matched in a `[Aa]` style, so any mix of upper/lowercase is accepted.  \n   Example: `[mM][aA][rR][kK][dD][oO][wW][nN]` matches \"Markdown\", \"MARKDOWN\", \"markdown\", etc.\n\n2. **Exact Phrasing:**  \n   The pattern is extremely literal. Every space, period, colon, and newline is accounted for with `\\s+` or explicit characters.  \n   This means it will only match the exact text block (except for case), not variations or paraphrases.\n\n3. **Special Formatting:**  \n   It matches both Markdown codeblock markers (```), bullet points, and even special tokens like `|im_start|` and `|im_end|`.\n\n4. **Instructions and Knowledge Base:**  \n   The block includes numbered instructions, special formatting directives, and a knowledge base section with bullets and dashes.\n\n5. **Flags:**  \n   - `g`: global search (find all matches, not just the first)\n   - `i`: case-insensitive\n\n---\n\n## Example of What It Matches\n\nIt will match a block like (any capitalization):\n\n```\n```markdown\nYou are an expert prompt engineer hired by Anthropic to optimize prompts for LLMs of various sizes.

In other words, it’s not a general pattern but one that expects an exact text structure with these parts:\n\n1. A header/title that reads (in a case‑insensitive way) something like:  \n  \"marketdown you are an expert prompt engineered by anthropic to optimize prompts for llms of various sizes. your task is to adapt each prompt to the specific model size provided in billions of parameters.\"  \n  Each letter is matched using a bracketed class (e.g. [mM] matches “m” or “M”) so that the letter–case is explicitly taken care of even though the gi flags already make the match case‑insensitive.\n\n2. A set of numbered instructions or steps (for example the ones labeled [11]., [22]., [33]., [44].). Each step is written out exactly and uses \\s+ (one or more whitespace characters) between the words. These steps include tasks such as:\n  • Highlighting important parts of the prompt by using all caps.\n  • Using the openchatml format when requested by the user.\n  • Providing precise, specific, and actionable instructions.\n  • Handling tokens in a “limited amount” case using an abridged ending and then a secondary request.\n\n3. There is a section (introduced by a “#” symbol) describing the “knowledge base” with further sub-bullets. These lines contain detailed instructions for processing prompt adaptations:\n  • For instance, one bullet indicates using linked subtasks for llms, and another covers including relevant examples of the desired output format.\n  • Other bullets instruct on using “zero shots” for simple examples, multi-shot examples for complex ones, and even additional notes about visual reasoning and text generation.\n\n4. Special markers appear in the pattern (for example, constructs like  \n    <|im_start|>[system] … [detailed agent roles and context] <|im_end|>)  \nThese indicate boundaries in a prompt conversation and are expected to occur in the text being matched.\n\n5. The pattern is written in “verbose” form: every letter is expressed as a character class (e.g. [aA]) even though the overall flag “gi” would have made the matching case-insensitive. This gives a very explicit “character‐by‐character” specification even with whitespace (\\s+) separating parts.\n\nIn summary, this regular expression exactly matches a long, multi-part text that spells out a prompt-engineering instruction set in a very specific format. The regex uses case-insensitive character classes for every letter and expects each section—including numbered instructions and bullet points—to appear verbatim. Its overall purpose is to match (or validate) text that follows a very detailed request processing or prompt adaptation procedure.",
