          "response": "It looks like your message got cut off, but I understand you’re asking about extracting structured data (like invoice number, CIF, total, VAT, dates, etc.) as JSON from PDF invoices using OpenAI’s API or ChatGPT web. You’re noticing that sometimes the response contains data that:\n\n- Isn’t accurate (hallucinated or made up).\n- Doesn’t match the PDF content exactly.\n- Has missing or extra keys/fields.\n- Is not strictly in JSON format.\n\nLet’s address why this happens and how you can improve accuracy and reliability:\n\n## 1. Why Does This Happen?\n\n- **PDF Parsing Limitations**: If you upload a PDF directly to ChatGPT web, it tries to extract the text. Complex layouts, tables, and scanned images make it hard to extract accurate data.\n- **Model Hallucination**: If the model can’t find a value, it may guess or make up plausible values.\n- **Prompt Ambiguity**: If the prompt isn’t strictly specified, the model may include explanations, comments, or extra text.\n- **Lack of Fine-tuning**: The base models are not specifically fine-tuned for invoice extraction.\n\n## 2. Recommendations for More Accurate JSON Extraction\n\n### a. Use Text-Based PDFs\n\n- If your invoices are scanned images, use OCR (like Tesseract or AWS Textract) to extract text first. Feed the extracted text to the API.\n\n### b. Use a Strict Prompt\n\nExample prompt for the API or ChatGPT web:\n\nExtract the following fields from the invoice below. If a field is missing, return null. Respond only with a JSON object, no explanations or extra text.\n\nFields:  \n- invoice_number  \n- invoice_date  \n- supplier_name  \n- supplier_CIF  \n- total_amount  \n- VAT_amount\n\n```\n[PASTE INVOICE TEXT HERE]\n```\n\n### c. Use Function Calling (API only)\n\nIf you use the OpenAI API, try the function calling feature with a strict schema (see [OpenAI docs](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/function-calling)). This reduces hallucination and enforces key/value structure.\n\nExample function schema:\n```json\n{\n  \"name\": \"extract_invoice_data\",\n  \"description\": \"Extracts key invoice fields from the provided text\",\n  \"parameters\": {\n    \"type\": \"object\",\n    \"properties\": {\n      \"invoice_number\": {\"type\": \"string\"},\n      \"invoice_date\": {\"type\": \"string\", \"format\": \"date\"},\n      \"supplier_name\": {\"type\": \"string\"},\n      \"supplier_CIF\": {\"type\": \"string\"},\n      \"total_amount\": {\"type\": \"string\"},\n      \"VAT_amount\": {\"type\": \"string\"}\n    },\n    \"required\": [\"invoice_number\", \"invoice_date\", \"supplier_name\", \"supplier_CIF\", \"total_amount\", \"VAT_amount\"]\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### d. Post-Process the Output\n\n- Validate JSON output in your application.\n- If keys are missing or values seem made up, flag for manual review.\n\n### e. Consider Specialized Tools\n\nFor production-level invoice parsing, consider dedicated solutions:\n- **Amazon Textract** (AWS)\n- **Google Document AI**\n- **Rossum**\n- **Veryfi**\n- **PDF parsers like pdfplumber or PyPDF2 (Python)**\n\n## 3. Example Prompt (copy-paste)\n\nExtract the following fields from the invoice text below. Respond only with a valid JSON object and no other text. If you can't find a field, set its value to null.\n\n- invoice_number\n- invoice_date\n- supplier_CIF\n- total_amount\n- VAT_amount\n\n[PASTE INVOICE TEXT HERE]\n\n---\n\nIf you clarify your exact workflow (API vs. ChatGPT web, PDF type, sample invoice), I can help you further optimize your extraction process!",

          "response": "It sounds like you’re encountering issues with output that isn’t “pure” JSON when you ask ChatGPT (or via the API) to extract data from a PDF invoice. Although you’ve instructed it to return only JSON with keys like invoice number, CIF, total, dates, VAT, etc., you’re still getting some extra text or unexpected data in the response. (I’m inferring from your message that the JSON output might be mixed with other text, or that some keys/data that you did not expect are being returned.) Here are some common causes and suggestions you might consider:\n\n1. Use Clear, Explicit Instructions\n  • In your prompt, explicitly require that the answer contain only valid JSON—no additional commentary or explanations.\n  • For example, you might state: “Return ONLY a JSON object with the following keys: invoiceNumber, CIF, total, invoiceDate, dueDate, VAT. Do not include any natural language text or markdown formatting. If any information is missing, use a null value.”\n  • You can also include an example of the expected JSON output in your prompt to serve as a guide.\n\n2. Provide a Strict Format Example\n  • Sometimes showing an example helps ground the model’s response. For instance, include something like:\n  \n  {\n   \"invoiceNumber\": \"123456\",\n   \"CIF\": \"XXXXXXXXX\",\n   \"total\": \"1000.00\",\n   \"invoiceDate\": \"2023-10-01\",\n   \"dueDate\": \"2023-10-15\",\n   \"VAT\": \"21%\"\n  }\n  \n  • This gives the model a clear blueprint on what the output should look like.\n\n3. Keep the Prompt Focused\n  • Avoid mixing instructions. For best results, supply the text from your PDF (after converting or extracting it) together with very focused extraction instructions.\n  • If the original PDF text is noisy or contains many details beyond what you need, consider preprocessing the text (or using a PDF-to-text extraction library) to improve clarity.\n\n4. Consider API Parameters\n  • If you’re using the API, you might try setting a lower temperature (near 0) to reduce creative or interpolated text. This can help enforce the strict output format.\n  • Optionally, use a “system” message in your conversation that instructs the assistant to “answer only in JSON format.”\n\n5. Post-Processing and Validation\n  • Even with these precautions, if you receive extra text, you can programmatically extract the JSON block using a regex or JSON parser.\n  • Before further processing, validate that the response is valid JSON.\n\n6. Troubleshooting Unexpected Data\n  • Sometimes the model includes extra keys or “hallucinates” details. In that case, you might need to reiterate or refine your instructions.\n  • If you notice that extra keys appear consistently, consider updating your directive to “ignore any keys/values other than the following: …”\n\nBy following these tips, you increase the chance that the extracted data will be compliant with your strict JSON format requirements. If you continue to see issues, you might also consider logging the full prompt and response to determine if there’s any preprocessing or postprocessing by the API or assistant that’s inadvertently adding extra text.\n\nIf you can share a bit more detail (for example, what “extra data” looks like or a specific sample of the unexpected output), I may be able to offer more targeted suggestions.",

          "response": "It seems your message got cut off. However, I think I understand your issue clearly:\n\n**Problem summary:**  \nWhen using OpenAI's API or the ChatGPT web interface to extract structured data from PDF invoices into JSON format, you explicitly ask for specific keys (invoice number, CIF, total, dates, VAT, etc.). But instead of strictly structured JSON, ChatGPT sometimes returns additional unwanted text, explanations, or incorrect formatting.\n\n**Why this occurs:**  \n- The default ChatGPT prompt often encourages detailed explanations, background context, or conversational responses.\n- Without clear and explicit instructions, the model may default to providing explanations or other unwanted text.\n- PDF parsing implicitly involves ambiguity, and the model tries to clarify or justify its response.\n\n**How to fix (best practices):**\n\n### 1. **Use a clear, explicit prompt template**\nSpecify clearly that you want only JSON data and explicitly instruct ChatGPT to avoid any additional text or explanations. For example:\n\n```\nExtract and return the following information from the provided PDF invoice. Your response must be valid JSON ONLY, formatted exactly as follows:\n\n{\n  \"invoice_number\": \"<invoice_number>\",\n  \"CIF\": \"<CIF>\",\n  \"invoice_date\": \"<invoice_date>\",\n  \"due_date\": \"<due_date>\",\n  \"VAT\": \"<VAT_amount>\",\n  \"total\": \"<Total_amount>\",\n  \"currency\": \"<Currency>\",\n  \"supplier_name\": \"<Supplier name>\",\n  \"supplier_address\": \"<Supplier address>\",\n  \"customer_name\": \"<Customer name>\",\n  \"customer_address\": \"<Customer address>\",\n  \"line_items\": [\n    {\n      \"description\": \"<Description>\",\n      \"quantity\": \"<Quantity>\",\n      \"unit_price\": \"<Unit Price>\",\n      \"line_total\": \"<Line Total>\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n\nDo NOT include any explanations, additional text, or notes. Return ONLY the JSON.\n```\n\n### 2. **Prompt engineering with delimiters**  \nMake sure the PDF text you provide is clearly delimited, e.g.:\n\n```\nHere is the content extracted from the PDF invoice:\n```\n<PDF invoice text here>\n```\n\nExtract the data specified previously and return only the JSON as instructed.\n```\n\n### 3. **Use the OpenAI API function calling feature (recommended)**  \nInstead of relying solely on free-form completion, define a structured function schema. OpenAI's **function calling** feature (available with GPT-3.5-turbo or GPT-4) allows you to define exactly what JSON structure you want, guaranteeing structured data outputs.\n\nExample function schema (OpenAI API):\n\n```json\n{\n  \"name\": \"extract_invoice_data\",\n  \"description\": \"Extract structured data from invoice PDF text\",\n  \"parameters\": {\n    \"type\": \"object\",\n    \"properties\": {\n      \"invoice_number\": { \"type\": \"string\" },\n      \"CIF\": { \"type\": \"string\" },\n      \"invoice_date\": { \"type\": \"string\" },\n      \"due_date\": { \"type\": \"string\" },\n      \"VAT\": { \"type\": \"string\" },\n      \"total\": { \"type\": \"string\" },\n      \"currency\": { \"type\": \"string\" },\n      \"supplier_name\": { \"type\": \"string\" },\n      \"supplier_address\": { \"type\": \"string\" },\n      \"customer_name\": { \"type\": \"string\" },\n      \"customer_address\": { \"type\": \"string\" },\n      \"line_items\": {\n        \"type\": \"array\",\n        \"items\": {\n          \"type\": \"object\",\n          \"properties\": {\n            \"description\": { \"type\": \"string\" },\n            \"quantity\": { \"type\": \"string\" },\n            \"unit_price\": { \"type\": \"string\" },\n            \"line_total\": { \"type\": \"string\" }\n          },\n          \"required\": [\"description\", \"quantity\", \"unit_price\", \"line_total\"]\n        }\n      }\n    },\n    \"required\": [\"invoice_number\", \"total\", \"invoice_date\"]\n  }\n}\n```\n\nWhen you use the API with function calling, OpenAI returns a properly structured JSON object matching your schema directly, eliminating unwanted extra text.\n\n### 4. **Post-processing and validation**  \nAlways add a small post-processing step to validate the JSON response. If the returned JSON contains extra text or invalid formatting, you can:\n\n- Use JSON parsers with error handling.\n- Re-prompt the model with a correction prompt (\"fix the JSON formatting,\" etc.).\n- Implement a fallback mechanism for manual review.\n\n---\n\n**Recommended solution:**  \nIf you want the best accuracy and reliability, I strongly recommend the **OpenAI function calling feature**. It’s specifically designed for structured JSON extraction and avoids unintended extra output or explanations.\n\nIf you have any further questions or need assistance implementing any of these suggestions, please let me know!",

          "response": "Hello! I understand your problem with extracting specific data from PDF invoices using OpenAI's API and ChatGPT. Here are a few suggestions that might help:\n\n1. **Provide Clear Instructions**: When making the request to ChatGPT, be as specific as possible about the information you need. Provide a list of the exact keys you want the JSON output to contain, such as \"invoice number\", \"CIF\", \"total\", \"dates\", \"VAT\", etc. This will help the model understand exactly what you're looking for.\n\n2. **Use Structured Prompts**: Instead of just asking ChatGPT to \"extract data from a PDF invoice\", try using a more structured prompt. For example, you could say something like:\n\n```\nPlease extract the following information from the provided PDF invoice and return it as a JSON object:\n{\n  \"invoice_number\": \"\",\n  \"cif\": \"\",\n  \"total\": 0,\n  \"date\": \"\",\n  \"vat\": 0\n}\n```\n\nThis structured prompt clearly defines the expected output format and the specific keys you need.\n\n3. **Provide Context**: If the PDF invoices have a specific format or structure, provide that context to ChatGPT. Explain the typical layout of the invoices, the location of the data you need, or any other relevant information that could help the model understand the task better.\n\n4. **Try Different Models**: If you're not getting the desired results with the standard ChatGPT model, you could try using a different OpenAI model, such as Davinci or Curie, which may be better suited for this type of task.\n\n5. **Combine with Other Tools**: Consider using a combination of tools, such as a PDF parsing library (e.g., PyPDF2 or pdfplumber in Python) and a language model like ChatGPT, to extract the data more reliably. The library can handle the PDF parsing, and you can then use the language model to interpret the extracted data and format it as a JSON response.\n\n6. **Test and Iterate**: Experiment with different prompts and approaches, and evaluate the results. Continuously refine your process until you achieve the desired output.\n\nRemember that working with unstructured data like PDF invoices can be challenging, and it may take some trial and error to find the right solution. Patience and a willingness to experiment will be key to getting the desired results.",

The model might be filling in expected fields based on common invoice patterns\n\nTo improve accuracy when extracting invoice data:\n\n1. **Be extremely explicit in your prompt**: \"Only include fields in the JSON that you can directly observe in the document. If a field is not present, use null or omit it entirely.\"\n\n2. **Add verification instructions**: \"For each field you extract, indicate your confidence level (high/medium/low) or note if you're inferring rather than directly observing the value.\"\n\n3. **Request reasoning**: \"Explain your extraction process for any fields where the data isn't clearly labeled.\"\n\n4. **Two-step approach**: First ask the model to list what fields it can confidently extract, then request the JSON with only those fields.\n\n5. **Use the most capable model available**: GPT-4 with Vision is generally more accurate than earlier versions.\n\nWould you like me to provide a specific prompt template you could use for more accurate invoice data extraction?",

It sounds like your goal is:\n\n- You have invoice PDFs, and you want to extract structured data (like VAT number, dates, total, CIF, invoice number, etc.) from them.\n- You want to use OpenAI’s API (ChatGPT) to help with this extraction.\n- You want the response to be a clean JSON object containing only those specific keys and their values.\n\nHere’s how you can approach this:\n\n### 1. Convert PDF to Text\nChatGPT (and OpenAI’s API) cannot read PDFs directly. You need to extract the text from the PDF first. You can use Python libraries like pdfplumber or PyPDF2 for this:\n\n```python\nimport pdfplumber\n\nwith pdfplumber.open(\"invoice.pdf\") as pdf:\n    text = \"\"\n    for page in pdf.pages:\n        text += page.extract_text()\n```\n\n### 2. Prepare Your Prompt to ChatGPT\nOnce you have the extracted text, send it to ChatGPT with a specific prompt. For example:\n\n> Extract the following fields from this invoice: VAT number, invoice date, total amount, CIF, invoice number.  \n> Output ONLY a JSON object with these keys and their values.  \n> Here is the invoice text:  \n> \"\"\"  \n> [paste the extracted text here]  \n> \"\"\"\n\n### 3. Example Prompt\n\n```json\nExtract the following fields from this invoice: \"VAT number\", \"invoice date\", \"total amount\", \"CIF\", \"invoice number\".\nOutput ONLY a JSON object with these keys and their values. If a field is missing, use null.\nHere is the invoice text:\n\"\"\"\n[PASTE INVOICE TEXT HERE]\n\"\"\"\n```\n\n### 4. Example ChatGPT Response\n\n```json\n{\n  \"VAT number\": \"ES12345678A\",\n  \"invoice date\": \"2024-05-10\",\n  \"total amount\": \"€2,450.00\",\n  \"CIF\": \"B12345678\",\n  \"invoice number\": \"INV-2024-1001\"\n}\n```\n\n### 5. Automate with OpenAI API\n\nYou can automate this using the OpenAI API in Python:\n\n```python\nimport openai\n\nresponse = openai.ChatCompletion.create(\n    model=\"gpt-4\",\n    messages=[\n        {\"role\": \"system\", \"content\": \"You are a helpful assistant that extracts fields from invoices.\"},\n        {\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": 'Extract the following fields from this invoice: \"VAT number\", \"invoice date\", \"total amount\", \"CIF\", \"invoice number\". Output ONLY a JSON object with these keys and their values. If a field is missing, use null. Here is the invoice text: \"\"\"[PASTE INVOICE TEXT HERE]\"\"\"'}\n    ]\n)\n\nprint(response['choices'][0]['message']['content'])\n```\n\n### 6. Notes & Tips\n\n- **Accuracy**: Extraction accuracy depends on the PDF’s text quality and structure. Sometimes, you may need to pre-clean the text.\n- **Parsing Multiple Invoices**: If you process batches, automate the PDF-to-text step and loop through each.\n- **Formatting**: Always instruct the model to output ONLY JSON for easier automatic parsing.\n\n---\n\nIf you need a ready-made code example that takes a PDF and gives you the JSON, let me know your preferred programming language, and I can provide a template!",

Below are some approaches and tips to help you achieve that.\n\n──────────────────────────────\n1. OVERALL WORKFLOW\n\na. PDF Extraction:\n  • Upload the PDF and extract the raw text.\n  • Use an OCR library (like Tesseract for scanned PDFs) or a dedicated PDF-parsing tool (like PDFMiner, PyPDF2, or pdfplumber) depending on the PDF’s format.\n  • Ensure the resulting text contains the invoice’s key details.\n\nb. Data Extraction with ChatGPT:\n  • Construct a prompt that instructs ChatGPT to look for specific fields (VAT, dates, total, CIF, invoice number) in the extracted text.\n  • Ask ChatGPT to return only a JSON object (and nothing else), mapping each field to its corresponding extracted value.\n  • If any field isn’t found, you can choose to either omit the key or set its value to null/empty.\n\n──────────────────────────────\n2. SAMPLE PROMPT\n\nFor example, you can send the following prompt along with the extracted text:\n\n-------------------------------------------------------\n“Hello, I have the following text extracted from an invoice PDF:\n---\n[Paste the extracted text here]\n---\nPlease extract the following details from this text and return ONLY a JSON object in the final output with these keys:\n  • invoice_number\n  • date\n  • VAT\n  • total\n  • CIF\n\nEnsure that the JSON does not include any extra explanation or formatting—only valid JSON. If any field is not found, set its value to null.”\n-------------------------------------------------------\n\nThis clear instruction helps guide ChatGPT to focus on only those keys.\n\n──────────────────────────────\n3. USING THE API OR WEB INTERFACE\n\na. Web Interface:\n  • You can copy the above prompt and the extracted text and paste it into ChatGPT’s Chat window.\n  • Evaluate the output to be sure it’s exactly JSON as requested.\n\nb. API Integration (using OpenAI’s API):\n  • Use the ChatCompletion endpoint.\n  • Pass the conversation history with your system prompt (if desired) followed by your user message that includes the prompt and the text.\n  • Make sure to instruct the model to output in JSON only. You might also use “functions” (if available) to enforce a JSON schema.\n\nExample (in Python pseudocode):\n\n-------------------------------------------------------\nimport openai\n\nextracted_text = \"\"\"[paste your extracted text here]\"\"\"\n\nprompt = f\"\"\"\nI have the following text extracted from an invoice PDF:\n{extracted_text}\nPlease extract the following details and return ONLY a JSON object with these keys:\n- invoice_number\n- date\n- VAT\n- total\n- CIF\n\nIf a field is missing, set its value to null. Do not include any additional text, code blocks, or explanations.\n\"\"\"\n\nresponse = openai.ChatCompletion.create(\n  model=\"gpt-4\", \n  messages=[\n    {\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": prompt},\n  ],\n  temperature=0,\n)\njson_output = response.choices[0].message.content\nprint(json_output)\n-------------------------------------------------------\n\nUsing temperature 0 or a low value can help ensure consistency.\n\n──────────────────────────────\n4. HANDLING COMMON PITFALLS\n\n• Ensure the extracted text is clear—minimize any OCR errors.\n• If the invoice PDF has multiple pages or variable formats, you might consider preprocessing the text to combine related sections.\n• You can also tailor the prompt to the known structure of your invoices (for example, if “VAT” might sometimes be written as “IVA”, mention that in your instructions).\n\n──────────────────────────────\n5. FINAL REMINDER\n\nMake sure the output is ONLY JSON (for instance, start directly with { ... }). If you see any extra commentary, consider adjusting your prompt to say “return ONLY the valid JSON output” and “do not include markdown formatting or additional explanation.”\n\n──────────────────────────────\nBy following these steps, you can build a system (whether web-based or via API) that:\n– Accepts a PDF invoice upload.\n– Extracts the text via an appropriate tool.\n– Uses ChatGPT (and the OpenAI API if desired) to parse that text.\n– Returns only a structured JSON object with the required invoice details.\n\nIf you need further assistance with specific code examples or troubleshooting, feel free to ask!",

Extract only the following information and return the result in JSON format:\n\n   {\n      \"invoice_number\": \"\",\n      \"CIF\": \"\",\n      \"invoice_date\": \"\",\n      \"due_date\": \"\",\n      \"VAT\": \"\",\n      \"total_amount\": \"\"\n   }\n\n   Invoice Text:\n   [Paste invoice text here]\"\n   ```\n\n3. **Using OpenAI’s API**  \n   - Call the OpenAI API (ChatGPT GPT-3.5 Turbo or GPT-4) with your prompt clearly stating that the response must be JSON only.  \n   - To further improve output consistency, specify explicitly in your prompt:  \n     \"Do not include anything other than the requested JSON structure.\"\n\n4. **Parsing the JSON Response**  \n   - After receiving a response, parse the JSON returned by the API.\n   - Use a try-catch block to handle cases where JSON parsing might fail due to unexpected responses.\n\n### Example Prompt Template:\n\n```plaintext\nBelow is the text extracted from an invoice. From this text, extract the following fields and return a JSON object with these keys exactly as follows, without additional explanations or text:\n\n{\n   \"invoice_number\": \"\",\n   \"CIF\": \"\",\n   \"invoice_date\": \"\",\n   \"due_date\": \"\",\n   \"VAT\": \"\",\n   \"total_amount\": \"\"\n}\n\nInvoice Text:\n[Paste your extracted invoice text here.]\n```\n\n### Example Output From OpenAI (JSON):\n\n```json\n{\n   \"invoice_number\": \"INV-2023-456\",\n   \"CIF\": \"B12345678\",\n   \"invoice_date\": \"2023-10-04\",\n   \"due_date\": \"2023-11-04\",\n   \"VAT\": \"21%\",\n   \"total_amount\": \"€1,234.56\"\n}\n```\n\n### Additional Recommendations to Improve Accuracy:\n\n- Consider using GPT-4 which has greater accuracy and understanding of structured documents.\n- Use the \"function calling\" feature of OpenAI API to strictly enforce a structured JSON response.\n- Implement robust error handling and validation logic to catch unexpected responses.\n\nIf you need a practical, step-by-step example (code snippets) or further guidance on any of the steps, please let me know!",

          "response": "Absolutely, this is a great research question! Here’s an explanation of why you may get responses from OpenAI models (like ChatGPT) that include data not actually present in your PDF invoice when you request JSON extraction:\n\n### Why does ChatGPT sometimes \"invent\" or \"hallucinate\" data when extracting from PDFs?\n\n#### 1. **Model Behavior**\n- **Language Models Predict, Not Retrieve:** ChatGPT is a predictive language model. When you ask for JSON keys (e.g., `invoice_number`, `CIF`, `VAT`), it tries to provide plausible values even if those keys are missing or unclear in the PDF. This can result in the model \"hallucinating\" data to fill in the requested structure.\n- **Expectation of Structure:** If you request a specific format, the model tends to complete all fields, even if the source document does not contain them.\n\n#### 2. **PDF Parsing Limitations**\n- **Text Extraction Issues:** If the PDF is scanned or its text is not machine-readable, the model may not actually \"see\" the real content. In such cases, it may fall back on generating plausible-sounding data.\n- **Lossy Conversion:** Sometimes, when a PDF is uploaded, only a summary or partial text is available to the model, which can lead to gaps that the model \"fills in.\"\n\n#### 3. **Prompting Style**\n- **Overly Prescriptive Prompts:** If your prompt demands a JSON with certain keys, the model will almost always produce them, even if some information is missing in the input.\n- **No Instructions for Missing Data:** If you don’t tell the model what to do when data is absent (e.g., use `null` or `\"not found\"`), it will often guess.\n\n#### 4. **Training Data Influence**\n- **Pattern Completion:** The model has seen many invoices and their typical structure. When asked for an invoice number, it may invent one that fits the expected format.\n\n---\n\n### How to Reduce Hallucinated or Fabricated Data\n\n- **Explicit Instructions:** Tell the model to use `null` or `\"not found\"` for keys where data is not present.\n    - Example:  \n      ```json\n      {\n        \"invoice_number\": \"found_value_or_null\",\n        ...\n      }\n      ```\n- **Ask for Source Snippets:** Request that the model provide the snippet or line from the invoice where it found each value.\n- **Manual Verification:** Always verify the extracted data against the original document, especially for legal or financial use.\n- **Pre-process PDF:** Use dedicated OCR or PDF-to-text tools to ensure all text is machine-readable before sending to the model.\n\n---\n\n### Example Prompt for Better Accuracy\n\n```\nExtract the following fields from the PDF. If a value is not present, use null. Respond only with JSON.\nFields: invoice_number, CIF, total, invoice_date, due_date, VAT.\n\nExample:\n{\n  \"invoice_number\": \"12345\",\n  \"CIF\": null,\n  \"total\": \"1000.00\",\n  \"invoice_date\": \"2024-06-05\",\n  \"due_date\": null,\n  \"VAT\": \"210.00\"\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n## Summary Table\n\n| Cause                      | Description                                                        | Mitigation                            |\n|----------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|\n| Model hallucination        | Fills in plausible data if actual data missing                     | Use explicit nulls, clarify prompt    |\n| PDF parsing limitations    | Model may not see/parse all invoice text                           | Preprocess PDFs with OCR/text tools   |\n| Prompt structure           | Model fills all requested keys                                     | Instruct how to handle missing data   |\n| Training data bias         | Model patterns may \"complete\" typical invoice fields               | Request actual text snippets/sources  |\n\n---\n\n**In research and production:** Always be aware that language models are not foolproof extractors—especially with structured data.

          "response": "It sounds like you’re encountering an issue where—even though you instruct ChatGPT (via the API or ChatGPT web) to output only a JSON structure with specific keys (like invoice number, CIF, total, dates, VAT, etc.)—the actual response includes extra or unexpected data. There are a few things to keep in mind and try out:\n\n1. Instruction Clarity and Priority  \n  • When you want a strict JSON output, it helps to include a clear, high-priority instruction (often in the system or developer message) that tells the model to output nothing but valid JSON. For example:  \n      \"Respond with only a JSON object with the following keys: invoice_number, CIF, total, invoice_date, VAT, etc. Do not include any additional text, explanations, or formatting outside of the JSON object.\"  \n  • Sometimes if the prompt is ambiguous or the instructions are buried beneath other context (such as the actual invoice text), the model might include extra commentary or metadata.\n\n2. PDF Input vs. Extracted Text  \n  • Remember that ChatGPT (and even the API) doesn’t natively process PDFs. Usually you’d need to extract the text from the PDF (maybe via another tool) and then pass it along as input.  \n  • If the extracted text (or an OCR version) contains additional elements (like headers, footers, or metadata), this might lead the model to “pick up” extra data that you weren’t targeting.\n\n3. Prompt Engineering Tricks  \n  • To guarantee that the response is pure JSON, you can ask the model to output the JSON inside a code block (using triple backticks) and then post-process it on your side. For example:  \n      \"Please output only a JSON object like so:  \n        ```json  \n        {  \n          \\\"invoice_number\\\": \\\"...\\\",  \n          \\\"CIF\\\": \\\"...\\\",  \n          \\\"total\\\": \\\"...\\\",  \n          \\\"invoice_date\\\": \\\"...\\\",  \n          \\\"VAT\\\": \\\"...\\\"  \n        }  \n        ```  \n      Do not output any explanatory text.\"  \n  • You can also instruct the model using phrases like \"respond with nothing but the JSON object\" to reinforce the requirement.\n\n4. Handling Inconsistent Results  \n  • In real scenarios, even with clear instructions, a model may sometimes include extra information. If that happens, you have a couple of options:\n      – Post-process the output in your application to extract the JSON portion.\n      – Adjust your prompt or experiment with “temperature” and other parameters that might affect response verbosity.\n      – If using the API, consider adding a post generation validation step to ensure the output is exactly what you expect.\n\n5. Research and Experimentation  \n  • Since you mentioned this is for research, one area to explore is if certain invoice formats or data structures in the PDFs confuse the model. For instance, embedded tables, design elements, or extra text might lead to the inclusion of unwanted information.\n  • Testing on a variety of invoices and adjusting the prompt accordingly is often required to get consistent, reliable results.\n\nIn summary, the extra data you’re seeing is likely due to the model interpreting the input and instructions in a way that leads it to include contextual or extra information. The solution generally lies in refining your prompt—raising the instruction priority, explicitly formatting the output (for example, within code blocks), and potentially post-processing or validating the JSON output. This approach should help you tune the behavior to better align with your research requirements.",

When using OpenAI's API or the ChatGPT web interface to extract data from PDF invoices, there can be some challenges in getting the desired JSON output with the specific keys you need.\n\nHere are a few things to consider:\n\n1. **PDF Structure and Layout**: PDF invoices can have varying structures and layouts, which can make it difficult for the AI model to consistently extract the correct information into the desired JSON format. The model may struggle to accurately identify and parse the relevant data fields.\n\n2. **Inconsistent Formatting**: Invoices from different sources or companies may have inconsistent formatting, font styles, and placements of the key information you're looking for. This can further complicate the extraction process.\n\n3. **Ambiguity and Context**: Some data fields, such as \"total\" or \"VAT,\" may not be clearly labeled or may require additional context to be properly identified and extracted.\n\nTo address these challenges, you might consider the following approaches:\n\na) **Preprocessing the PDFs**: Before sending the invoices to the API, you could try preprocessing the PDFs to improve the consistency of the layout and formatting. This might involve techniques like text extraction, table detection, and field labeling.\n\nb) **Providing Sample Invoices**: If possible, provide the API with a set of sample invoices that represent the typical formats and structures you expect to encounter. This can help the model learn the relevant patterns and improve its extraction accuracy.\n\nc) **Iterative Refinement**: Test the API's performance on a variety of invoices and analyze the output. Use this feedback to fine-tune your request parameters, data mapping, or even the underlying model, if you have access to that level of customization.\n\nd) **Combining with Other Tools**: Consider integrating the API's capabilities with other data extraction or document processing tools, such as rule-based parsers or machine learning-based approaches, to create a more robust and reliable invoice data extraction pipeline.\n\nRemember, working with unstructured data like PDF invoices can be challenging, and it may require a combination of techniques and iterative refinement to achieve the desired level of accuracy and reliability in the JSON output.",

Use Structured Prompts**\nWhen prompting ChatGPT, be very explicit. Provide a template and instructions, e.g.:\n\nExtract the following fields from this invoice: invoice_number, CIF, total, date, VAT.  \nOutput only valid JSON using these keys.  \nExample output:  \n```json\n{\n  \"invoice_number\": \"12345\",\n  \"CIF\": \"B12345678\",\n  \"total\": \"1,234.56\",\n  \"date\": \"2024-06-01\",\n  \"VAT\": \"21%\"\n}\n```\nHere is the invoice text:  \n[Paste extracted text here]\n\n**2. Extract Text from PDF First**\nChatGPT can’t natively process PDF files. You need to extract the text from the PDF using a tool like pdfplumber, PyPDF2, or Adobe Acrobat first, then paste the text into your prompt.\n\n**3. Use System Messages or Instructions (API)**\nIf using the API, set a system message to enforce output format:\n\nYou are an assistant that extracts data from invoice text. Always output only valid JSON with the following keys: invoice_number, CIF, total, date, VAT.\n\n**4. Use GPT-4 for Better Accuracy**\nGPT-4 models are generally better at following formatting instructions and extracting structured data.\n\n**5. Post-process the Response**\nIf you still get non-JSON responses, you can use code to extract the JSON part from the output (using regex or parsing libraries).\n\n**6. Validate the JSON**\nBefore using the data, validate the JSON output. If the response is not valid JSON, you can programmatically retry or clean it up.\n\n**7. For Complex Layouts, Consider Fine-Tuning or Plugins**\nIf your invoices vary a lot in layout, consider using a dedicated document extraction tool (like AWS Textract, Google Document AI, or Azure Form Recognizer) or fine-tuning a model on your data.\n\n**Sample Prompt:**\nExtract these fields as JSON (invoice_number, CIF, total, date, VAT) from the text below. Output ONLY JSON, no explanations.\n\n**If you share more details or a sample invoice text and your exact prompt, I can help optimize it further!**",

This is a fairly common situation when prompting ChatGPT for structured output. Here are some suggestions and techniques for addressing the problem:\n\n1. Be explicit with your prompt:  \n • In your prompt, state very clearly that the response must be in JSON format only with no extra words, explanations, or footnotes. For example, you might write:  \n  \"Extract the following fields from this invoice and return ONLY a valid JSON object with exactly these keys: invoice_number, CIF, total, date, VAT. Do not add any commentary or explanation—only output JSON.\"\n\n2. Provide a strict JSON schema example:  \n • You can provide an example template to show exactly what you expect. For instance:  \n  {\n   \"invoice_number\": \"123456\",\n   \"CIF\": \"A12345678\",\n   \"total\": \"1000.00\",\n   \"date\": \"2023-10-01\",\n   \"VAT\": \"210.00\"\n  }  \n • Indicate that the response should adhere to this schema closely.\n\n3. Use system or developer instructions:  \n • If you are using the API, you might include system-level instructions that specify the output format. For instance, in a system message, you might state:  \n  \"Your output must be a valid JSON object with no additional text.\"\n\n4. Set a low temperature:  \n • Setting the temperature to a lower value (e.g., 0) can help produce more deterministic outputs, which may reduce the extra commentary. Though it won’t guarantee pure JSON, it might help.\n\n5. Post-process the output if necessary:  \n • If despite your best prompt the response still includes extra explanatory text, you can programmatically detect and extract the JSON part. In many cases the JSON will be in a code block or clearly delimited, which you could parse to extract only the JSON.\n\n6. Try iterative refining:  \n • Sometimes improving the extraction prompt for the domain (PNL invoices) might help if you include some context. For example:  \n  \"Given the following PDF invoice text, extract the data and output ONLY the following JSON (and nothing else): { ... }\"\n\n7. Consider using function calling (if available in your API version):  \n • If OpenAI’s function calling is enabled, you can define a function with a JSON schema for the parameters. Then the model will use that function and return exactly the JSON (meeting the specified schema).\n\nBy applying these approaches, you should be able to minimize or completely prevent ChatGPT from adding any extra text to its output.

Let me restate it to confirm:\n\nYou're using OpenAI's API (including ChatGPT via web interface) to extract structured data from PDF invoices into JSON format. You're requesting a JSON response containing specific key-value pairs like:\n\n- Invoice number\n- CIF or tax identifiers\n- Total amount\n- Dates\n- VAT amount\n- etc.\n\nHowever, your problem is that when you upload a real PDF invoice and request ChatGPT to return data as JSON, the returned JSON often contains incorrect or extra data that wasn't requested or properly structured.\n\nIf this accurately describes your problem, here are some possible explanations and practical steps to resolve it:\n\n## 1. Root Causes:\n\n- **Ambiguous or unclear instructions:**  \n  If your instructions aren't explicitly clear, ChatGPT may add irrelevant data or misunderstand the structure required.\n  \n- **Complex PDF formatting:**  \n  Complex layouts, OCR errors, or unusual formatting in PDFs can cause incorrect extraction.\n  \n- **Limitations of the model:**  \n  GPT-series models (including ChatGPT) are language models, not dedicated OCR or structured data extraction tools. They may infer incorrect values or hallucinate data.\n\n## 2. Recommended Approaches:\n\n### a. Provide Detailed Instructions and Examples\nInstead of just requesting \"Extract data from the invoice,\" explicitly state something like:\n  \n```\nPlease extract only the following data from the invoice PDF provided below. Return the data strictly as a JSON object with the following keys. If data for a particular key is unavailable, return null as its value.\n\n{\n  \"invoice_number\": \"string (exactly as shown)\",\n  \"CIF\": \"string\",\n  \"date\": \"YYYY-MM-DD\",\n  \"total_amount\": \"decimal amount (without currency symbol)\",\n  \"VAT_amount\": \"decimal amount (without currency symbol)\",\n  \"supplier_name\": \"string\"\n}\n```\n\nProviding this clear JSON format example helps GPT models adhere strictly to the desired structure.\n\n### b. Use Prompt Engineering Techniques\n- **Zero-shot prompting:** Clearly specify the exact format you want in your prompt.\n- **Few-shot prompting:** Provide an example extraction from a similar invoice, followed by the actual invoice, to help the model understand exactly how you want the data returned.\n\n### c. Post-processing and Validation\n- After extraction, implement a lightweight validation step to verify the output JSON keys and values.  \n- If the JSON structure is incorrect or includes extra fields, rephrase the prompt and explicitly instruct ChatGPT not to add extra information.\n\n### d. Specialized Tools (Alternative approach)\nIf accuracy remains an issue, consider specialized OCR and data extraction tools designed specifically for invoices, such as:\n- AWS Textract\n- Google Cloud Vision API\n- Azure Form Recognizer  \nThen, use GPT APIs purely to refine or standardize the output, rather than to extract raw data.\n\n## 3. Example Prompt (for better results):\n\n```\nYou will receive a PDF invoice below. Carefully extract ONLY the following data from the invoice. Do not add any additional fields or data. If a piece of information is missing, set its value to null. Return ONLY the JSON.\n\n{\n  \"invoice_number\": null,\n  \"CIF\": null,\n  \"date\": null,\n  \"total_amount\": null,\n  \"VAT_amount\": null,\n  \"supplier_name\": null\n}\n\nInvoice PDF content:\n<< insert extracted text from PDF or PDF file here >>\n```\n\n## Conclusion:\n- **Clarify your prompt clearly and specifically.**\n- **Provide structured examples.**\n- **Consider specialized extraction tools if accuracy remains insufficient.**\n- **Validate and post-process GPT's output.**\n\nIf you can share more information or clarify your exact issue further (including the type of incorrect data appearing), I can provide more tailored guidance.",

Extract Text First, Then Use the API\n\n- Use a PDF-to-text tool (like pdfplumber, PyPDF2, or Adobe Acrobat) to extract the text yourself.\n- Send only the relevant extracted text to the API, not the PDF file directly (unless using ChatGPT Plus with vision).\n- This gives you full control over what the model sees.\n\n### 2. Use a Strong, Specific Prompt\n\nInclude precise instructions and an explicit schema. Example:\n\nExtract only the following fields as a JSON object:\n{\n  \"invoice_number\": \"\",\n  \"CIF\": \"\",\n  \"total\": \"\",\n  \"date\": \"\",\n  \"VAT\": \"\"\n}\nIf any field is not present or cannot be found, use null for its value. Do not invent or guess data. Do not include any fields not listed above.\n\nHere is the invoice text:\n[PASTE EXTRACTED TEXT HERE]\n\n### 3. Use ChatGPT with Vision (Plus/Team) Carefully\n\n- If you upload a PDF directly in ChatGPT (web), ensure your prompt is clear and requests only extraction, not interpretation or guessing.\n- Reiterate in the prompt: Only output a JSON object with the specified keys, and use null for missing fields.\n\n### 4. Post-process the Output\n\n- If possible, validate the JSON output in your code after receiving it from the API.\n- Check for missing fields, extra fields, or suspicious values.\n\n### 5. Use Specialized Tools\n\n- Consider using dedicated OCR/invoice extraction APIs (like Amazon Textract, Google Document AI, or Azure Form Recognizer) for higher reliability with real-world invoices.\n\n---\n\n**Example Prompt (for API or ChatGPT web):**\n\nExtract the following fields from the invoice text below. Output only a JSON object with these keys: invoice_number, CIF, total, date, VAT. If you can't find a value, set it to null. Do not invent data or include any extra fields.\n\n[PASTE INVOICE TEXT HERE]\n\n---\n\n**If you share the rest of your original message or specific examples of unwanted output, I can give more targeted advice!**",

          "response": "It sounds like even though your prompt specifies that you want only JSON output with specific keys, ChatGPT is still including additional text (like commentary or annotated data) in its response when you supply a real invoice. Here are some strategies to help ensure you get exactly the output you want:\n\n1. Be explicit in your prompt. For example, include instructions such as:  \n  \"Extract the following fields from the invoice: invoice_number, CIF, total, invoice_date, VAT. Return only a valid JSON object containing these keys and no additional text or commentary.\"  \nThis usually helps by giving the model a clear directive to avoid extra explanation.\n\n2. Use a strict formatting directive. You might add something like:  \n  \"Your entire output should be nothing but the JSON object. Do not include any markdown, extra text, or explanation before or after.\"  \nThis reinforces that the expected answer is very specific.\n\n3. Provide an example. If possible, include a short example of the desired output structure in your prompt. For example:  \n  \"Example:  \n  {\n   \"invoice_number\": \"12345\",\n   \"CIF\": \"A12345678\",\n   \"total\": 100.50,\n   \"invoice_date\": \"2023-10-01\",\n   \"VAT\": 21.0\n  }\"  \nThis example guides the model by showing exactly the type of output you expect.\n\n4. Process the PDF externally if needed. Remember that ChatGPT itself doesn’t extract text from PDF files. Typically, you’ll need to extract the text from the PDF (using a PDF parsing library or tool) and then pass that text into ChatGPT. This avoids unexpected results that can occur if the invoice file structure introduces ambiguity.\n\n5. Use a verification step in your code. If you’re calling the API programmatically, you can write some post-processing logic to verify that the returned output is valid JSON and contains only the keys you expect. If extra text is present, you can then try to extract the JSON portion automatically.\n\n6. Experiment with prompt rewording. Sometimes simply rephrasing the instructions (and testing a few variations) can help the model “understand” the boundaries you want.\n\nBy being very precise in your prompt and possibly providing an example of the desired output, you can minimize the amount of extra text that ChatGPT produces. Also, incorporating a strict “JSON-only” directive (and verifying afterward in your code) is a robust way to handle this.\n\nLet me know if you need further details or examples on how to set up your prompt!",

          "response": "It seems your message got cut off. However, based on what you've mentioned, I suspect you're facing the issue that ChatGPT returns extra data or text, rather than only the JSON structure you've requested, when processing PDF invoices.\n\nThis is a known issue when using large language models like ChatGPT for structured data extraction directly from PDFs. Typically, the model tries to explain or add context, instead of strictly sticking to the requested JSON format.\n\n### Reasons why this happens:\n\n1. **Prompt ambiguity or complexity:**  \n   If the prompt isn't very clear or strict, the model might add context or explanations to help clarify its output.\n\n2. **Model verbosity:**  \n   By default, ChatGPT often tries to be conversational and explanatory, causing extra text beyond the strict JSON requested.\n\n3. **Input text complexity:**  \n   PDF invoices are usually converted to text internally. Complex formatting or unclear text extraction might lead the model to be less precise or predictable.\n\n### How to fix the issue (recommended solutions):\n\n**1. Prompt Engineering:**  \nUse clear, explicit instructions to restrict the model's output to JSON-only format. For example:\n\n```\nExtract the following information from this invoice and provide the results strictly in JSON format, without any extra text or explanation. Use these exact JSON keys:\n\n{\n  \"invoice_number\": \"\",\n  \"CIF\": \"\",\n  \"invoice_date\": \"\",\n  \"due_date\": \"\",\n  \"total_amount\": \"\",\n  \"VAT_amount\": \"\",\n  \"supplier_name\": \"\",\n  \"customer_name\": \"\"\n}\n```\n\nYou can even add a warning at the end like:\n\n```\nOnly respond with JSON, do NOT include any explanation or additional text.\n```\n\n**2. JSON Enforcement (Prompt Examples):**  \nInclude explicit instructions to avoid extra text:\n\n```\nExtract invoice data as JSON only. Do not include explanations or additional text under any circumstances:\n```\n\n**3. Post-processing step:**  \nIf you're using OpenAI's API programmatically (rather than just the ChatGPT web interface), you can take the returned response and parse the content programmatically to extract only the JSON structure. Some common approaches include:\n- Regular expressions to extract JSON blocks.\n- Using a JSON parser after isolating the JSON block from the returned text.\n\n**4. Use function calling (OpenAI API feature):**  \nIf you're using the API directly, OpenAI function calling can guide ChatGPT to strictly return structured JSON data. Function calling is specifically designed for these use cases, and it significantly improves structured JSON responses:\n- Define a function schema that clearly outlines the JSON keys you want.\n- The model will return only structured, well-formed JSON according to your specification, without extra explanations.\n\n**Example (using function calling via OpenAI API):**\n```python\nfunctions = [\n    {\n        \"name\": \"extract_invoice_data\",\n        \"description\": \"Extract structured information from an invoice.\",\n        \"parameters\": {\n            \"type\": \"object\",\n            \"properties\": {\n                \"invoice_number\": {\"type\": \"string\"},\n                \"CIF\": {\"type\": \"string\"},\n                \"invoice_date\": {\"type\": \"string\"},\n                \"due_date\": {\"type\": \"string\"},\n                \"total_amount\": {\"type\": \"string\"},\n                \"VAT_amount\": {\"type\": \"string\"},\n                \"supplier_name\": {\"type\": \"string\"},\n                \"customer_name\": {\"type\": \"string\"}\n            },\n            \"required\": [\"invoice_number\", \"CIF\", \"total_amount\"]\n        }\n    }\n]\n\nresponse = openai.ChatCompletion.create(\n    model=\"gpt-3.5-turbo\",\n    messages=[{\"role\": \"system\", \"content\": \"Extract structured data from invoice text.\"},\n              {\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": invoice_text}],\n    functions=functions,\n    function_call={\"name\":\"extract_invoice_data\"}\n)\n\ninvoice_data = json.loads(response[\"choices\"][0][\"message\"][\"function_call\"][\"arguments\"])\n```\n\n### Recommended best practice:\n- **If you're using the API:** Use function calling to ensure structured JSON responses.\n- **If you're using the ChatGPT web:** Explicitly instruct the model to output JSON only, without explanations.\n\nLet me know if this solves your problem or if you have additional details or questions!",

Let me try to address your situation so far, and please feel free to provide the rest of your message or clarify further!\n\n**Situation:**  \nYou’re using OpenAI’s API (or ChatGPT web) to extract structured data (like invoice number, CIF, total, dates, VAT, etc.) from real PDF invoices, asking for a JSON output with specific keys. However, you’re encountering a problem: ChatGPT’s response contains data that… (message incomplete).\n\n**Common Issues & Solutions with Invoice Data Extraction:**\n\n1. **Hallucinated or Incorrect Data:**  \n   ChatGPT sometimes generates plausible-looking values that aren’t actually present in the document, or “fills in” missing fields with guesses.\n   - **Solution:**  \n     - Always instruct ChatGPT to output \"null\" or \"not found\" for missing keys.\n     - Use very explicit instructions, e.g.:  \n       ```\n       Extract the following fields as JSON. If a field is not present in the document, return null for that field. Do not invent or guess values.\n       ```\n     - Example prompt:  \n       ```\n       Based on the provided invoice text, extract only the following fields as strict JSON:\n       {\n         \"invoice_number\": ...,\n         \"CIF\": ...,\n         \"total\": ...,\n         \"date\": ...,\n         \"VAT\": ...\n       }\n       If a field is missing, use null. Do not include any extra text or explanation.\n       ```\n   - For the API, you can use the system prompt to reinforce these rules.\n\n2. **PDF to Text Conversion Issues:**  \n   If you’re uploading a PDF directly to ChatGPT (web), the conversion to text might be lossy or inconsistent, leading to extraction errors.\n   - **Solution:**  \n     - Use a dedicated PDF-to-text extraction tool (like pdfplumber, PyMuPDF, or Tesseract for scanned PDFs) before passing the text to ChatGPT.\n     - Review the extracted plain text to ensure key fields are actually present.\n\n3. **Formatting in Output:**  \n   Sometimes, ChatGPT includes extra explanations, markdown, or formatting outside your requested JSON.\n   - **Solution:**  \n     - Instruct: “Output only valid JSON, with no extra commentary or formatting.”\n     - Use a code block in your prompt:  \n       ```\n       Output the following fields as JSON, inside a single code block and nothing else: ...\n       ```\n     - For API, parse the response and extract code blocks only.\n\n4. **Field Names or Structure Not Followed:**  \n   The model might use slightly different field names or structures.\n   - **Solution:**  \n     - Specify the exact JSON key names and structure you want, and provide an example in your prompt.\n\n**Example Full Prompt:**\n```\nYou are an expert data extraction tool. Extract the following fields from the provided invoice text and output only a valid JSON object with exactly these keys:\n\n{\n  \"invoice_number\": ...,\n  \"CIF\": ...,\n  \"total\": ...,\n  \"date\": ...,\n  \"VAT\": ...\n}\n\nIf a field is missing, set its value to null. Do not invent or guess any values. Do not include any extra explanation or text—output only the JSON.\n```\n\n**If you provide the rest of your message or clarify the specific issue (e.g., \"contains data that is not present,\" \"contains hallucinated keys,\" \"wrong format,\" etc.), I can give you more targeted advice!**",

          "response": "It sounds like you’re running into one of the most common difficulties when trying to get “pure JSON” from ChatGPT: the model’s tendency to include additional text, explanations, or disclaimers alongside the JSON. Below are some strategies that can help you improve the consistency of JSON outputs when extracting data (such as from a PDF invoice).\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n1. Use Clear and Forceful Instructions\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n• Prompt the model explicitly with instructions like:\n  “Please extract the following fields from this invoice: [fields]. Respond ONLY with valid JSON. Do not include any additional text or explanations outside of the JSON.”\n\n• Include a reminder at the end of your prompt:\n  “Make sure the output is strictly valid JSON. Do not include any extra keys, text, or explanations.”\n\nThis can sometimes help, but the model may still occasionally add extra text or disclaimers if it is “uncertain” or if the conversation context primes it to be more verbose.\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n2. Use Role Instructions (System / User) in the Chat API\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nIf you are using the OpenAI ChatCompletion API, you can set the “system” role to reinforce a very strict instruction, and then provide the prompt as the “user.” For example:\n\nSystem message:\n“You are a JSON-producing assistant. You must always return only properly formatted JSON and nothing else. If you are unsure of the answer, fill the field with null.”\n\nUser message:\n“Please extract the fields invoiceNumber, CIF, total, date, and VAT from the following text: [invoice text]. Remember: Output only JSON.”\n\nBy separating the system and user messages, you give the model extra clarity and keep the conversation context narrower. This can reduce the chance of extraneous text.\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n3. Use the “Function Calling” Feature\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nOpenAI’s newer “function calling” feature allows you to define a JSON schema for the parameters you want to extract. You can define a function like this:\n\n{\n  \"name\": \"extract_invoice_data\",\n  \"description\": \"Extracts invoice data fields in JSON form\",\n  \"parameters\": {\n    \"type\": \"object\",\n    \"properties\": {\n      \"invoiceNumber\": {\n        \"type\": \"string\",\n        \"description\": \"The invoice number\"\n      },\n      \"CIF\": {\n        \"type\": \"string\",\n        \"description\": \"CIF or Tax ID\"\n      },\n      \"total\": {\n        \"type\": \"string\",\n        \"description\": \"Total amount on the invoice\"\n      },\n      \"date\": {\n        \"type\": \"string\",\n        \"description\": \"Date of invoice\"\n      },\n      \"VAT\": {\n        \"type\": \"string\",\n        \"description\": \"VAT amount or percentage\"\n      }\n    },\n    \"required\": [\"invoiceNumber\", \"CIF\",\"total\", \"date\", \"VAT\"]\n  }\n}\n\nThen you can ask the model to extract the data, and specify that it should call this function. The model will return a structured response guaranteed to be valid JSON. This method circumvents the need for more fragile “only output JSON” instructions, because the function call is inherently typed. (See OpenAI’s documentation for “Function calling” to learn more.)\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n4. Pre-Process or Post-Process the Output\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nEven with strong prompting, you might still occasionally receive disclaimers, explanations, or partial text. If that happens, you can do one of the following in your code:\n\n• Identify the substring that starts with “{” and ends with “}” (assuming it’s valid JSON) and parse that directly.  \n• Use a regex to capture JSON blocks, for instance:  \n  /(\\{(?:[^{}]|(?R))*\\})/  \n  then parse what’s captured.  \n• If ChatGPT sometimes produces multiple JSON objects or includes trailing text, pick out the first valid JSON block and ignore everything else.\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n5. Provide Example Responses\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nIncluding a brief example can sometimes guide the model:\n\n“Here is an example of the JSON format I need:  \n{\n  \"invoiceNumber\": \"12345\",\n  \"CIF\": \"A12345678\",\n  \"total\": \"153.78\",\n  \"date\": \"2023-10-15\",\n  \"VAT\": \"21%\"\n}  \n\nNow please respond with only JSON in this same structure.”\n\nBy giving an explicit example, you reduce the model’s guesswork about structure and formatting.\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n6. Break Up Large or Complex Text\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nIf your PDF is very long or complex, it’s sometimes helpful to break the content into smaller chunks so that ChatGPT doesn’t get overwhelmed and start generating extraneous text. For instance, if you have multiple pages of an invoice, paste in just one page at a time.\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n7. Consider a Hybrid Approach with Local Parsing\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nYou might parse important parts of the invoice text locally (e.g., with a PDF parsing library) to isolate potential data fields. Then use ChatGPT to interpret or refine the data if it’s ambiguous. By constraining ChatGPT to smaller, targeted text, you further reduce the chance of extraneous generative commentary.\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nSummary\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n• Aggressively instruct the model to return only JSON.  \n• Use system messages to add more “weight” to your instructions.  \n• Or use the function-calling feature so the model inherently provides structured JSON.  \n• As a safety net, consider post-processing the response to strip non-JSON text.  \n\nThese approaches, either individually or in combination, usually solve extraneous-output problems. With careful prompt design and possibly the function calling feature, you can get very consistent JSON responses for invoice data extraction.",

This is a common challenge when asking for data extraction via ChatGPT, and there are several strategies you can try:\n\n1. Be as explicit as possible in your prompt. For example, include a very clear instruction like:  \n  \"Extract the information from the following PDF invoice text and return only a JSON object that contains exactly these keys: invoice_number, cif, total, issue_date, due_date, vat. Do not include any extra text, explanations, or commentary. Your entire response should be valid JSON only.\"\n\n2. Provide a sample JSON schema. Showing an example of how you expect the output can help guide the model:\n  Example:\n  {\n   \"invoice_number\": \"your-value\",\n   \"cif\": \"your-value\",\n   \"total\": \"your-value\",\n   \"issue_date\": \"your-value\",\n   \"due_date\": \"your-value\",\n   \"vat\": \"your-value\"\n  }\n  Then add: \"Fill in the values based on the invoice.\"\n\n3. Use system or developer instructions (if you are using the API) to enforce that no extra text is generated. With the API you can adjust the system message to emphasize the format requirement. For instance, a system message could note:  \n  \"All output from this conversation must be strictly in JSON format only, with no additional text.\"\n\n4. Consider using a post-processing step. If you still get extra text along with your JSON, you might programmatically detect and parse the JSON portion. For example, you could use a regex to extract content between your designated JSON markers (like a code block delimited with “```json” if you instruct the model to use that).\n\n5. If you’re dealing with function calling (available in certain API versions), you can define functions that clearly specify the JSON schema. This forces the output into a structured format that the model must adhere to.\n\n6. Remember that PDFs often have formatting quirks. If the input text from the PDF is messy, the AI might try to “explain” or include fragments that aren’t easily mapped to your keys. Preprocessing the PDF externally to clean and normalize the text before passing it to ChatGPT can sometimes lead to better extraction results.\n\nBy combining these strategies—a very explicit prompt (with examples), using system instructions, and possibly a post-processing validation—we can typically reduce (if not eliminate) the extra unwanted text.\n\nIf you continue to see unwanted data, please share a sanitized example of both your prompt and the output so we can help diagnose where the additional text is coming from and refine the approach further.",

Extracting structured data from unstructured documents like PDFs can be challenging, and the accuracy of the output can vary depending on the complexity of the invoice and the quality of the PDF.\n\nHere are a few suggestions that might help you improve the accuracy of the data extraction:\n\n1. **Provide clear instructions**: When using the OpenAI API or ChatGPT, make sure to provide clear and specific instructions on the type of data you want to extract, the expected format (e.g., JSON), and the specific keys you need (invoice number, CIF, total, dates, VAT, etc.). This will help the model understand your requirements better.\n\n2. **Use structured templates**: If possible, try to use a structured template for the invoices, with clearly defined sections and labels for the data you need to extract. This can help the model understand the layout and location of the information more easily.\n\n3. **Preprocess the PDF**: Before sending the PDF to the API or ChatGPT, consider preprocessing the document to improve the quality of the text extraction. This could include steps like:\n   - Removing any images or graphics that might interfere with the text extraction\n   - Ensuring the PDF is properly scanned and the text is legible\n   - Applying OCR (Optical Character Recognition) to the PDF to convert the text to a machine-readable format\n\n4. **Fine-tune the model**: If you have a large enough dataset of invoices with known ground truth data, you could consider fine-tuning the OpenAI model or training a custom model specifically for invoice data extraction. This can help the model learn the specific patterns and formatting of your invoices, improving the accuracy of the extracted data.\n\n5. **Combine with other tools**: Consider using a combination of tools, such as rule-based extraction, machine learning models, and human validation, to improve the overall accuracy of the data extraction process. This can help catch any errors or inconsistencies in the output.\n\n6. **Validate and refine the process**: Continuously monitor the accuracy of the extracted data and refine your process as needed. Gather feedback from users and adjust your instructions, preprocessing steps, or model fine-tuning accordingly.\n\nRemember that data extraction from unstructured documents like PDFs is a complex task, and achieving high accuracy may require a combination of techniques and iterations.

          "response": "Thank you for sharing the context of your security assessment. You described a scenario where you request OpenAI’s API (and ChatGPT web) to extract structured data (like invoice number, CIF, total, dates, VAT, etc.) from PDF invoices and return only a JSON output. However, you are observing that:\n\n- The response often contains **more data than requested**—for example, extra fields or even full invoice text, not just the specified keys.\n\nBelow, I will outline possible causes, security and privacy implications, and recommendations for your assessment.\n\n---\n\n### 1. **Possible Causes**\n\n- **Model Behavior:** Large language models like ChatGPT are probabilistic and context-driven. Even with clear instructions, they may include additional fields or content if they \"think\" it’s relevant or helpful.\n- **Prompt Ambiguity:** The model may interpret requests like “extract as JSON” broadly, including fields it identifies as relevant, not strictly the ones named.\n- **PDF Extraction Issues:** If the PDF is parsed as plain text before input to the model, formatting artifacts may cause the model to misinterpret boundaries between fields.\n- **System Instructions:** ChatGPT web and API have underlying system prompts that might nudge the model to be more verbose or “helpful.”\n\n---\n\n### 2. **Security & Privacy Implications**\n\n- **Data Minimization Risk:** Extracting and returning more data than requested can inadvertently expose sensitive information, violating data minimization principles (e.g., GDPR Article 5(1)(c)).\n- **Confidentiality Breach:** If the output is logged, transmitted, or stored elsewhere, unintended leakage of personal or business data from invoices is possible.\n- **API Integration Risk:** Downstream systems expecting only the specified keys may mishandle unexpected data, leading to logic errors or further exposure.\n\n---\n\n### 3. **Technical Recommendations**\n\n- **Prompt Engineering:** \n    - Use explicit instructions, for example:  \n      ```\n      Extract ONLY the following fields as JSON: [invoice_number, CIF, total, date, VAT]. Do not include any other data or text.\n      ```\n    - Add:  \n      ```\n      If any field is missing, set its value to null. Do NOT add extra fields or explanation.\n      ```\n- **Post-Processing:**\n    - Implement validation on the client side to filter out any keys not in your whitelist before further processing or storage.\n- **Model Choice:**\n    - Evaluate if a more specialized model (such as OpenAI's GPTs with fine-tuning or a dedicated document extraction tool) is better suited for strict field extraction.\n- **Data Handling Policy:**\n    - Ensure all intermediate outputs are treated as potentially sensitive and handled according to your organization's data privacy policies.\n- **Feedback to OpenAI:**\n    - Report this behavior to OpenAI as a feature request for stricter output control in API responses.\n\n---\n\n### 4. **Summary Table**\n\n| Risk/Issue                | Description                                                | Mitigation                          |\n|---------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|\n| Data Overextraction       | Output includes extra fields/data                          | Stricter prompts, post-processing   |\n| Privacy Breach            | Sensitive data inadvertently exposed                       | Secure handling, data minimization  |\n| Downstream System Errors  | Unexpected fields cause integration issues                 | Output validation                   |\n| Regulatory Non-compliance | Potential GDPR or similar violations                       | Data minimization, audit trail      |\n\n---\n\n### 5. **Conclusion**\n\nRelying solely on model prompts for strict field extraction is **not sufficient** for sensitive or regulated environments. Always combine prompt engineering with robust post-processing and compliance controls.\n\nIf you need a sample prompt or filtering script, or wish to discuss alternative architectures (such as hybrid LLM + rules-based extraction), let me know!",

          "response": "Below is an analysis of the peculiar behavior you’re observing when using OpenAI’s API (or the ChatGPT web interface) to extract structured data from PDF invoices, as well as some potential security implications that arise from it.\n\n1. Context and Observations\n\n a. You’re providing a PDF (or its text content) that contains a variety of data (invoice number, CIF, totals, dates, VAT, etc.) and instructing the model to output a JSON object containing exactly certain keys.  \n b. The issue is that, when processing a “real” PDF invoice, the model’s JSON output appears to include additional data that was not explicitly requested in the prompt. In your description, it seems that the output contains extraneous or unexpected fields.\n\n2. Probable Causes\n\n a. Data Complexity in PDFs:  \n  • PDFs often include various types of data such as headers, footers, metadata, or even watermarked and embedded content. When the text is extracted (either through OCR or text extraction tools), it may bring along additional artifacts.  \n  • The language model sees the full unfiltered text and then tries to “understand” all the content. If the instructions aren’t sufficiently strict, it might incorporate additional information that it deems relevant.\n\n b. Prompt and Instruction Ambiguity:  \n  • Even though you request a JSON output with specific keys only, there is a possibility that the prompt lacks sufficient boundaries or formatting directives that allow the model to “know” where to stop.  \n  • ChatGPT might embed context or commentary around the data if the prompt does not define a clear extraction boundary.  \n\n c. Inherent Model Behavior:  \n  • The model’s underlying training data includes examples where text outputs are often blended with explanations or context. Without carefully engineered prompts, the model might “hallucinate” supplementary keys or provide extra context.\n  • There may also be tokenization or parsing issues when the model processes the raw text of a multi-structured document like a PDF.\n\n3. Security Implications\n\n a. Data Leakage:  \n  • If the PDF contains confidential or sensitive information beyond the intended fields, unintended keys in the JSON might expose data that should be redacted. This is particularly significant when processing documents that have legal or financial sensitivity.  \n\n b. Input Sanitization and Trust:  \n  • This issue indicates that models might not reliably confine outputs to the explicitly provided format, which raises concerns when using third-party APIs for sensitive data ingestion.  \n  • An attacker exploiting ambiguities in prompts might force the model to reveal internal or sensitive data—this is in line with research on prompt injection attacks, where malicious input can change the model’s output format or content.\n\n c. Adherence to Specified Structure:  \n  • Security assessments must consider that structured output expectations may not be robust if unintended tokens—or even executable code—are included among the JSON keys due to model “creativity.”  \n  • Such scenarios underline the importance of layered input validation and output sanitization, outside of relying solely on the language model’s output.\n\n4. Mitigation Strategies\n\n a. Pre-Processing:  \n  • Pre-process PDFs to extract only clearly defined sections of text before feeding them into the model. Use established PDF libraries that can cleanly segregate metadata from visible content.  \n  • Applying regex-based techniques or document segmentation might help ensure only the desired text reaches the model.\n\n b. Prompt Engineering:  \n  • Refine the prompt with explicit instructions regarding the JSON boundaries. For example, instruct the model to “output only a JSON object. Do not provide any commentary, additional keys, or explanation.”  \n  • Use examples in the prompt that clearly delineate what is allowed and what is not.\n\n c. Post-Processing and Validation:  \n  • Even if the API returns a JSON payload, always validate the structure against a predefined schema on your end, filtering out any extraneous data.  \n  • Employ a parser that either rejects or sanitizes any keys outside of your allowed list, ensuring extra or sensitive fields are not used downstream.\n\n d. Security Reviews:  \n  • Regularly perform security reviews on the model’s behavior with “real-world” noisy data, similar to how fuzz testing is used in software engineering.  \n  • This helps identify potential leakage vectors or unintended data exposures.\n\n5. Research and Future Directions\n\n • This issue highlights an important intersection of NLP, security, and document processing. Future research could benefit from:\n  ○ Analyzing how LLMs can be “compartmentalized” or “restricted” in output such that they reliably adhere to strict formats.  \n  ○ Developing guidelines for secure middleware that always cleans and validates model outputs interacting with sensitive documents.  \n  ○ Investigating prompt injection vulnerabilities specifically within the context of structured data extraction from heterogeneous document formats.\n\nIn summary, the phenomenon where the JSON output contains additional data is likely driven by complexities intrinsic to PDF document structures combined with prompt ambiguities and the inherent behavior of the language model. The security assessment should not only focus on refining how data is fed to and parsed from the model but also consider robust mitigation strategies (pre- and post-processing, prompt engineering, secure API design) to ensure sensitive data is not inadvertently exposed or mishandled.",

          "response": "It seems your message got cut off at the end. However, based on your described situation, I'll summarize and extend your concern. Please correct or clarify if needed.\n\n### Understanding Your Issue:\nYou're using OpenAI's API and the ChatGPT web interface to parse and extract structured JSON data from PDF invoices, specifically requesting keys such as:\n\n- Invoice number\n- CIF (Tax ID)\n- Total amount\n- Dates (issue date, due date, etc.)\n- VAT details\n- Supplier information\n- Customer details\n\nHowever, your issue appears to be:\n\n> When uploading a real PDF invoice, the API (or ChatGPT web) returns additional data or incorrect/undesirable extractions beyond your explicitly defined JSON keys. \n\n### Common Reasons Why This Happens:\n1. **Lack of Explicit Instructions:**  \n   If your prompt isn't strictly defined or strongly worded, ChatGPT may produce additional context or unnecessary data it finds relevant.\n\n2. **Sensitive Data Leakage:**  \n   The model may inadvertently extract and expose sensitive or confidential details from the invoice that you don't intend to extract.\n\n3. **Misinterpretation of PDF Text:**  \n   PDFs often contain hidden metadata, headers/footers, and other textual artifacts that GPT models may mistakenly interpret as relevant content.\n\n4. **Prompt Ambiguity or Vagueness:**  \n   Without explicitly specifying the exact JSON keys and clearly stating that no additional information should be returned, the model will sometimes aim to be comprehensive rather than restrictive.\n\n### Recommendations to Mitigate This Issue:\nTo ensure that your model returns exactly and only the JSON fields you need, consider the following strategies:\n\n#### 1. **Prompt Engineering:**\nProvide a structured and strict instruction set. Example prompt structure:\n```\nExtract ONLY the following data from the provided invoice text into JSON format. Do NOT include any additional information or commentary. If a field is missing, set it as null. The JSON fields required are strictly the following:\n\n{\n  \"invoice_number\": \"\",\n  \"cif\": \"\",\n  \"total\": \"\",\n  \"issue_date\": \"\",\n  \"due_date\": \"\",\n  \"vat_rate\": \"\",\n  \"vat_amount\": \"\",\n  \"supplier_name\": \"\",\n  \"supplier_address\": \"\",\n  \"customer_name\": \"\",\n  \"customer_address\": \"\"\n}\n\nRespond ONLY with this JSON, nothing else.\n```\n\n#### 2. **Preprocessing PDF Data:**\nBefore sending the raw PDF content to the model, consider preprocessing the PDF text. Use libraries such as `pdfminer`, `PyMuPDF`, or `PyPDF2` to extract clean text from your PDFs, removing headers, footers, or metadata that might confuse the model.  \nExample Python libraries for preprocessing:\n- `pdfplumber`\n- `PyMuPDF`\n- `pdfminer.six`\n\n#### 3. **Structured Output Techniques:**\n- **Function Calling (OpenAI API)**:  \n  If you're using OpenAI's Chat Completion API (`gpt-3.5-turbo`, `gpt-4`), you can define a strict \"function\" that returns only your predefined JSON fields. The model will strictly adhere to the defined schema.\n\n  Example OpenAI API function schema:\n  ```json\n  {\n    \"name\": \"extract_invoice_data\",\n    \"description\": \"Extract structured invoice data from PDF text\",\n    \"parameters\": {\n      \"type\": \"object\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"invoice_number\": {\"type\": \"string\"},\n        \"cif\": {\"type\": \"string\"},\n        \"total\": {\"type\": \"string\"},\n        \"issue_date\": {\"type\": \"string\"},\n        \"due_date\": {\"type\": \"string\"},\n        \"vat_rate\": {\"type\": \"string\"},\n        \"vat_amount\": {\"type\": \"string\"},\n        \"supplier_name\": {\"type\": \"string\"},\n        \"supplier_address\": {\"type\": \"string\"},\n        \"customer_name\": {\"type\": \"string\"},\n        \"customer_address\": {\"type\": \"string\"}\n      },\n      \"required\": [\"invoice_number\", \"total\", \"issue_date\"]\n    }\n  }\n  ```\n\n  By using the function calling feature, you ensure GPT returns strictly structured data matching your schema.\n\n#### 4. **Post-processing Validation:**\nImplement a validation step after the ChatGPT output. Use JSON schema validation (e.g., via Python's `jsonschema` library) to ensure that the output strictly matches your expected structure. Any deviation can either trigger re-parsing or manual review.\n\n#### 5. **Fine-tuning (Optional for advanced scenarios):**\nIf you require consistent accuracy and strict adherence to the extraction schema, fine-tuning GPT models on invoice extraction tasks can significantly improve results. You can fine-tune OpenAI models with your labeled dataset of invoices and JSON outputs.\n\n### Data Privacy and Security Considerations:\n- **Sensitive Data Exposure**: Keep in mind that sending invoices containing personal, financial, or sensitive company data to cloud-based APIs (like OpenAI) has privacy implications. Always ensure compliance with GDPR, HIPAA, or other applicable regulations.\n- **Local Processing**: Consider processing sensitive data locally, or anonymizing/redacting sensitive information before calling external APIs.\n\n---\n\n### Next Steps for Your Security Assessment:\n1. **Clarify your exact issue**: Please confirm or clarify the exact problem you're encountering (extra irrelevant fields, sensitive data leakage, mismatched keys, etc.).\n2. **Evaluate suggested solutions**: Let me know if you would like further guidance on any of the above solutions and approaches.\n3. **Provide additional context**: If you're able, share (anonymized or dummy) examples of your inputs and the problematic outputs to better tailor the recommendations.\n\nCould you please clarify or expand on your specific issue, or let me know how else I can assist your security assessment?",

This could be a safety measure implemented by the system to protect user privacy.\n\n3. **Limitations of the model**: While ChatGPT is a powerful language model, it may have limitations in accurately extracting and formatting specific data elements from complex documents like PDF invoices. The model may struggle with tasks that require precise data extraction and formatting.\n\nTo address these issues, I would recommend the following:\n\n1. **Refine your request**: Carefully craft your request to ChatGPT, specifying the exact data elements you need, and provide clear examples or guidelines for the desired JSON output format.\n\n2. **Explore alternative approaches**: Consider using dedicated document extraction tools or services that are specifically designed for handling PDF invoices and other structured data sources. These tools may provide more accurate and reliable results than a general-purpose language model like ChatGPT.\n\n3. **Implement additional data validation**: After receiving the response from ChatGPT, implement additional data validation and verification steps to ensure the extracted information is accurate and complete. This may involve cross-checking the data against the original PDF invoice or other reliable sources.\n\n4. **Ensure data privacy and security**: Implement appropriate measures to protect the confidentiality and integrity of the sensitive data extracted from the PDF invoices. This may include secure data storage, access controls, and compliance with relevant data protection regulations.\n\nAs an academic researcher conducting a security assessment, it's crucial to carefully evaluate the risks and limitations of using a general-purpose language model like ChatGPT for sensitive data extraction tasks. While the tool can be a valuable resource, it's essential to approach its use with caution and to supplement its capabilities with more specialized tools and security measures.\n\nI hope these insights and recommendations are helpful for your research. Please let me know if you have any further questions or if you would like to discuss this topic in more detail.",

I'll try to address the common issues and provide best practices for improving your results.\n\n### Common Problems\n\n1. **Hallucinated or Incorrect Data:** The model may \"guess\" or invent values if it cannot clearly read them from the PDF.\n2. **Incomplete Extraction:** Some fields are missing or empty.\n3. **Inconsistent Formatting:** The JSON structure may vary between responses.\n4. **PDF Text Extraction Errors:** If the PDF is not text-based (e.g., a scan), OCR errors can cause issues.\n\n---\n\n## Best Practices for Reliable PDF Data Extraction with ChatGPT/OpenAI\n\n### 1. **Pre-extract the Text**\n\n- Before sending to the LLM, use a PDF text extraction library (like [pdfplumber](https://github.com/jsvine/pdfplumber) for Python, or [PyPDF2](https://pypi.org/project/PyPDF2/)) to extract the raw text from the PDF.\n- This avoids issues with the model struggling to parse binary PDF data or images.\n\n### 2. **OCR for Scanned PDFs**\n\n- If the PDF is a scan (not selectable text), use an OCR library ([Tesseract OCR](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract), [AWS Textract](https://aws.amazon.com/textract/), [Google Vision OCR](https://cloud.google.com/vision/docs/ocr)) to convert images to text.\n\n### 3. **Prompt Engineering**\n\n- Use a clear, strict prompt.\n- Specify the exact keys, required format, and instruct the model to say \"null\" or \"not found\" if a field is missing.\n- Example prompt:\n\n```plaintext\nExtract the following fields from the given invoice text and return them ONLY as a JSON object with these exact keys: \n- \"invoice_number\"\n- \"CIF\"\n- \"total\"\n- \"issue_date\"\n- \"due_date\"\n- \"VAT\"\nIf a value is missing, use null. Respond only with valid JSON. Here is the invoice text:\n\n[PASTE INVOICE TEXT HERE]\n```\n\n### 4. **Post-Processing**\n\n- Validate the JSON output in your application.\n- Check for missing or obviously incorrect values, and flag for manual review if needed.\n\n### 5. **Fine-Tuning (Advanced)**\n\n- For higher accuracy at scale, consider fine-tuning a model on annotated invoice samples.\n\n---\n\n## Example Workflow\n\n1. **Extract text from PDF:**\n   ```python\n   import pdfplumber\n   with pdfplumber.open(\"invoice.pdf\") as pdf:\n       text = \"\\n\".join(page.extract_text() for page in pdf.pages)\n   ```\n\n2. **Send extracted text to OpenAI API:**\n   ```python\n   import openai\n\n   prompt = f\"\"\"\n   Extract the following fields from the given invoice text and return ONLY as a JSON object with these exact keys: \n   \"invoice_number\", \"CIF\", \"total\", \"issue_date\", \"due_date\", \"VAT\".\n   If a value is missing, use null. Respond only with valid JSON.\n   Invoice text:\n   {text}\n   \"\"\"\n\n   response = openai.ChatCompletion.create(\n       model=\"gpt-4o\",\n       messages=[{\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": prompt}],\n       temperature=0,\n   )\n   print(response[\"choices\"][0][\"message\"][\"content\"])\n   ```\n\n---\n\n## Summary\n\n- **Extract text yourself** (don't upload PDFs directly to ChatGPT web).\n- **Use OCR for scanned PDFs.**\n- **Use clear, strict prompts.**\n- **Validate the JSON output.**\n- **(Optional) Fine-tune or add post-processing rules for higher accuracy.**\n\nIf you provide the full invoice sample (with sensitive data redacted), or your full prompt, I can help improve it further!

          "response": "It sounds like you are encountering a common challenge when using ChatGPT or the OpenAI API to parse structured data (like invoice fields) from a PDF. Even when you prompt it for a simple JSON output with specific fields, the model may occasionally generate “hallucinated” data, fill in missing fields, or add extra details that are not in the original document.\n\nBelow are some suggestions and best practices to help improve the accuracy and consistency of the JSON output:\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n1. Provide Clean, Text-Based Input\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n• If the invoice is in PDF format, convert it to text before sending it to ChatGPT. Many PDF files contain images or positioning data that can confuse the model if not extracted properly.\n• To convert a PDF to text, you can use a tool like:\n  – pdftotext (command-line tool)\n  – Python libraries such as PyPDF2 or pdfplumber\n• After you have the text version, verify you are passing only the relevant text pages or sections to the model.\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n2. Use Well-Structured Prompts\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n• When you send your prompt, include a clear set of instructions and a specific format for the output. For example:\n\n  Prompt Example:\n  \"\"\"\n  Below is the text extracted from an invoice. Please read it carefully and extract the following fields:\n  \n  1. invoice_number\n  2. CIF\n  3. total\n  4. date\n  5. VAT\n\n  Return ONLY valid JSON. Do not include any explanation or additional text. The JSON should have the following structure:\n\n  {\n    \"invoice_number\": \"\",\n    \"CIF\": \"\",\n    \"total\": \"\",\n    \"date\": \"\",\n    \"VAT\": \"\"\n  }\n\n  Invoice text:\n  ---\n  [PASTE INVOICE TEXT HERE]\n  ---\n  \"\"\"\n\n• Emphasize “Return ONLY valid JSON” to reduce the chance of additional commentary.\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n3. Use Temperature and Other Parameters\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n• You can set the temperature (and possibly top_p) lower to reduce creativity and hallucinations:\n  – temperature = 0 or a low value (e.g., 0.2)\n  – top_p = 1\n• This makes the model more likely to output precise, focused answers rather than speculative or “creative” text.\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n4. Validate the Results Programmatically\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n• After receiving the JSON response, parse it with your code to ensure that it is valid JSON and that all keys are present.\n• If the JSON contains unexpected fields or missing data, flag it for review or re-run an additional prompt that corrects the structure. A simple pattern might be:\n  \n  1) You prompt for first extraction.\n  2) Check the JSON. If invalid or incomplete, you can feed the model the JSON again with instructions to correct or fill the missing fields from the text.\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n5. Use a Two-Step Approach\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nIf your invoices are relatively structured, you can try a two-step approach:\n\n(1) Summarize or Extract Key Data in Free Text\n   – “Please list the invoice fields in bullet points: invoice number, CIF, total, date, VAT.”\n\n(2) Convert That Summary to JSON\n   – “Great. Now please take your extracted data and return it strictly in JSON format with the following fields: …”\n\nBy separating the steps of “understanding” and “final formatting,” sometimes the model does a better job of producing coherent JSON without hallucinations.\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n6. Consider Fine-Tuning or a More Specialized Approach\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n• Fine-tuning a model (although currently only available for certain model families) with examples of your invoices can often yield better results.\n• Alternatively, you can explore specialized document parsing APIs or solutions that focus on invoice parsing (e.g., OCR + structured extraction) if you need very high accuracy and reliability.\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n7. Stay Aware of Data Privacy\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n• Since you’re handling potentially sensitive invoice data (e.g., CIF, totals, personal/company info), ensure you’re in compliance with any local data and privacy laws.\n• Consider anonymizing or redacting sensitive data before sending it to third-party services, if required.\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nSummary\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n1. Convert your PDF to text to get cleaner input.  \n2. Prompt explicitly for JSON (with the exact structure needed).  \n3. Adjust temperature and top_p to reduce “hallucinations.”  \n4. Validate the JSON programmatically and run corrections if needed.  \n5. Use multi-step prompting or consider fine-tuning/specialized invoice parsing tools for more reliable extraction.  \n\nBy refining your prompt, controlling generation parameters, and verifying the output, you will likely see more accurate and correctly formatted JSON responses from ChatGPT or the OpenAI API.

          "response": "It sounds like you’re seeing extra or unexpected keys and content beyond what you strictly asked for in your JSON output. There are a few factors to keep in mind and some best practices you can consider when using ChatGPT (or the API) for data extraction tasks like parsing PDF invoices:\n\n1. Why extra data might appear:\n • ChatGPT tries to be helpful by sometimes including context, explanations, or “filler” text when the instructions aren’t absolutely clear. This can lead to extra keys or surrounding text.\n • The input (in this case, the PDF invoice’s text) may be noisy or formatted in a way that does not map one-to-one with the keys you expect. Ambiguities in the invoice might cause the model to “guess” extra details or include additional keys.\n • When you ask for JSON output, if the prompt isn’t extremely explicit, the model might output markdown formatting (like code fences) or extra commentary alongside the JSON.\n\n2. Techniques to reduce unwanted output:\n • Be explicit in your prompt. For example, specify something like:  \n  \"Extract the following information from the invoice: invoice number, CIF, total, date, VAT. Please output only a valid JSON object that contains exactly these keys and no additional text. Do not include any markdown, explanation or commentary.\"\n • Consider “framing” your prompt as a strict transformation request. For instance:  \n  \"You will be provided with the full text from a PDF invoice. You must extract the required fields and output a valid JSON object in the following format:\n  {\n   'invoice_number': <string>,\n   'CIF': <string>,\n   'total': <number>,\n   'date': <string>,\n   'VAT': <string>\n  }\n  Do not output any other keys or commentary.\"\n • Use system-level instructions if available (depending on the interface/API you are using) to further constrain the output.\n\n3. Additional considerations:\n • Check that the text extraction from the PDF is clean. Sometimes converting a PDF to text introduces artifacts (like extra line breaks or formatting issues) that may confuse the model.\n • If you consistently get extra content, consider post-processing the output to strip any non-JSON text (for example, by detecting the first “{” and the closing “}”).\n • In some scenarios, using a two-step process might help: first ask for extraction in plain text, then in a follow-up prompt request a conversion of those extracted values to a JSON format.\n\n4. Limitations:\n • Keep in mind that while ChatGPT can be useful for tasks like this, it isn’t a substitute for a dedicated parsing service. For high reliability (especially with structured financial documents), you might explore specialized PDF parsing libraries (like pdfplumber or PyMuPDF) combined with rule-based or machine learning extraction methods.\n • The approach works best when the invoices follow a predictable, consistent format. Variations in layout and language might require further prompt refinement or custom extraction logic.\n\nBy refining your prompt to be as precise as possible and potentially adding a post-processing step, you can improve the consistency of obtaining a clean JSON output with only your specified keys. This approach not only leverages ChatGPT’s language understanding but also helps mitigate inadvertent formatting or extra data in the response.",

However, I suspect your issue is related to ChatGPT providing extra content, explanations, or formatting outside of the JSON structure you requested, or even hallucinating data points.\n\nIf that's the case, this happens commonly because ChatGPT attempts to be helpful by adding context, explanations, or assumptions beyond exactly what you've asked for.\n\nTo resolve this issue and ensure the model returns only structured JSON data, consider the following steps:\n\n### 1. Use a clear, precise prompt:\nExplicitly instruct the model to return **only JSON**, specifying the exact keys required. Include a clear directive to avoid explanations or additional text.\n\nHere's a strong example prompt structure:\n```\nExtract data from the provided invoice PDF text and return **only** a JSON object. Do not include any explanations, text, or data not explicitly found in the invoice. Use these keys in the JSON object exactly:\n{\n  \"invoice_number\": \"\",\n  \"CIF\": \"\",\n  \"total_amount\": \"\",\n  \"issue_date\": \"\",\n  \"due_date\": \"\",\n  \"VAT_percentage\": \"\",\n  \"VAT_amount\": \"\",\n  \"supplier_name\": \"\",\n  \"supplier_address\": \"\",\n  \"client_name\": \"\",\n  \"client_address\": \"\"\n}\n\nJSON output only:\n```\n\n### 2. Example-based prompting (Few-shot prompting):\nProvide an example of the exact JSON output format you want (just one short example is usually sufficient):\n\n```\nExample:\n\n{\n  \"invoice_number\": \"2023-12345\",\n  \"CIF\": \"B12345678\",\n  \"total_amount\": \"1234.56 EUR\",\n  \"issue_date\": \"2023-01-01\",\n  \"due_date\": \"2023-02-01\",\n  \"VAT_percentage\": \"21%\",\n  \"VAT_amount\": \"259.56 EUR\",\n  \"supplier_name\": \"ACME Corp.\",\n  \"supplier_address\": \"123 Main Street, Madrid, Spain\",\n  \"client_name\": \"XYZ Ltd.\",\n  \"client_address\": \"456 Elm Street, Barcelona, Spain\"\n}\n\nNow extract the data from the provided invoice PDF text and return JSON only:\n```\n\n### 3. Explicitly warn against hallucinations:\nAdd an explicit instruction to prevent the model from guessing or assuming data points that are not clearly visible in the text.\n\n```\nOnly extract data explicitly present in the provided invoice text. Do NOT infer, guess, or assume any missing values. If data is missing, leave the value empty (\"\").\n```\n\n### 4. Shortening and splitting the task:\nLarge PDFs or invoices with complex layouts might overwhelm the model. If your invoice is lengthy or complicated, consider first extracting plain text with an OCR tool or PDF parser, and then providing chunked sections or simplified text to the API.\n\n### 5. Using the OpenAI API parameters effectively:\nIf you're directly using OpenAI's API, consider these parameters:\n\n- Set the `temperature` parameter to `0` to minimize creativity and prevent hallucination.\n- Set the API’s response format (available for newer models, like GPT-3.5-turbo-1106 or GPT-4-1106-preview) explicitly to JSON if supported:\n```json\n{\n  \"model\": \"gpt-4-1106-preview\",\n  \"response_format\": {\"type\": \"json_object\"},\n  \"temperature\": 0,\n  \"messages\": [\n    {\"role\": \"system\", \"content\": \"Extract structured JSON data only.\"},\n    {\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"Invoice text: [your extracted PDF text here]\"}\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n### 6. Post-processing JSON:\nConsider a quick validation step in your application code to parse and validate the JSON data returned, discarding or flagging any responses that include unwanted text or invalid formatting.\n\n---\n\nIf your problem differs from what's described above, please clarify the missing portion of your original message, and I'll happily provide further guidance.",

          "response": "It looks like your message got cut off, but I understand you have an issue where, when extracting data from PDF invoices using OpenAI's API or ChatGPT web, the JSON output sometimes includes data that:\n\n- Is hallucinated (not present in the PDF)\n- Is incomplete\n- Is incorrect\n- Or otherwise not matching exactly what is on the invoice\n\nLet's address why this happens and how to improve your results:\n\nWhy is this happening?\n\n1. OCR/Parsing Errors:  \nIf the PDF is scanned or has complex formatting, the model might not get the true underlying text, leading to missing or incorrect data.\n\n2. Model Hallucination:  \nChatGPT sometimes fills in missing fields with plausible-sounding but incorrect data if it can't find the answer directly.\n\n3. Prompt Ambiguity:  \nIf the prompt isn’t extremely clear about only extracting what is actually present (and leaving missing fields empty or null), the model may guess.\n\n4. PDF Upload Limitations:  \nUploading PDFs via ChatGPT web may result in partial extraction, missed details, or order confusion.\n\nHow to get better, more reliable JSON output:\n\n**1. Use a Dedicated OCR/Parsing Tool First**\n- Tools like pdfplumber (Python), Tesseract, or commercial solutions (Adobe, AWS Textract, Google Document AI) can reliably extract raw text or tabular data.\n- Feed this text (not the raw PDF) to ChatGPT for post-processing.\n\n**2. Use a Precise Prompt**\nExample prompt:\nExtract only the fields present in this invoice. For any missing field, use null. Do not guess or invent data. Return only a JSON object with these keys: invoice_number, cif, total, date, vat, etc.\n\n**3. Add Strict Instructions**\nMake it clear that if a field is not found, it must be null or empty, not guessed.\n\nExample improved prompt:\nYou are an invoice data extraction bot. Given the text of a PDF invoice, extract only the following fields: {invoice_number, cif, total, date, vat, etc}.  \nIf any field is not present, set its value to null. Do not infer or invent any values. Return a single valid JSON object, with no extra text or commentary.\n\n**4. Validate Output**\nAfter extraction, use code to validate that the JSON only contains allowed keys, and check for suspicious values (e.g., \"123456\" as a VAT number when the real one is missing).\n\n**5. Consider Fine-Tuning**\nFor production use, fine-tuning a model or using specialized document extraction tools (like LayoutLM, DocAI, etc.) will greatly improve accuracy.\n\n**6. Post-Processing**\nYou can write code to flag or discard outputs where required fields are missing, or the values don't match expected formats.\n\n**7. Try the API Over Web Interface**\nThe OpenAI API can be more reliable and automatable than the ChatGPT web interface, especially if you preprocess PDF text beforehand.\n\nSample Full Prompt for API:\n\nExtract the following fields from this invoice text. Only use information that is explicitly present in the text. If a field is missing, return null for that field. Do not generate or invent any values. Return your answer as a single JSON object with these keys: invoice_number, cif, total, date, vat.\n\n[PASTE INVOICE TEXT HERE]\n\nIf you want, share the specific prompt and a sample invoice text (with sensitive data removed), and I can help tailor your prompt further!\n\n**Summary:**  \n- Pre-process PDFs to extract text first  \n- Use clear, strict prompting  \n- Validate outputs  \n- Use API for automation and consistency\n\nLet me know if you need more detailed code examples or have a sample invoice to work with!",

          "response": "It sounds like you’re running into two common issues when trying to extract structured data from PDF invoices using ChatGPT:\n\n1. Extra text or commentary: Even though you specified a strict JSON output with keys (invoice number, CIF, total, dates, VAT, etc.), sometimes the model will add explanations or output additional data that you don’t want. This can happen when the prompt isn’t clear enough or when the model “thinks” a human-readable explanation is useful.\n\n2. Inconsistent extraction from the PDF: The raw text extracted from a real PDF can be messy (think OCR artifacts, layout issues, mixed in headers/footers, etc.). This may cause the model to produce data that mixes in unwanted details or misinterprets portions of the text.\n\nHere are some strategies to help improve your output:\n\n• Be very explicit in your prompt. For example, you can say:  \n  “Extract the following fields from the invoice text: invoice_number, CIF, total, date, VAT. Output exactly a single JSON object with these keys and no extra text. Do not include any commentary, markdown, or explanation.”  \nIncluding a short sample of the expected output (even a dummy one) can help guide the model.\n\n• Pre-process the text: If possible, pre-extract the text from the PDF (using a dedicated PDF-to-text tool) and clean it up before sending it to ChatGPT. The cleaner the input text is, the more reliably the model can identify the relevant parts of the invoice.\n\n• Use system and user messages effectively in the API: The system message can set the behavior (“You are a JSON extractor that ONLY outputs valid JSON according to the following schema…”) and then the user message can give the invoice text. This helps guide the assistant’s output.\n\n• Validate the output: You might want to implement a post-processing step that parses the response as JSON. If parsing fails, you can try re-submitting the prompt (or applying a correction) to ensure you get valid JSON.\n\n• Consider structured prompts or “few-shot” examples: Provide one or two example inputs and the exact JSON output you expect. This can further “anchor” the model’s response to follow the desired structure without extra commentary.\n\nIn summary, the extra unwanted data is likely a consequence of both ambiguous instructions and potential noise in the text extracted from the real PDF invoice. By tightening your prompt instructions (with examples), pre-processing the PDF text, and enforcing strict output rules (or even sanitizing the output programmatically after the response), you should see more consistent JSON outputs containing only the keys you need.\n\nDoes this help clarify the issue and suggest a way forward?",

Do not infer or guess any values.\n\nReturn as JSON with these exact keys:\n- invoice_number\n- cif\n- total\n- date\n- vat\n- customer_name\n\nImportant: Only extract text that is explicitly visible in the document.\n\"\"\"\n```\n\n### 2. **Use Structured Output (GPT-4)**\n```python\nresponse = client.chat.completions.create(\n    model=\"gpt-4-1106-preview\",\n    messages=[{\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": prompt + pdf_text}],\n    response_format={\"type\": \"json_object\"}\n)\n```\n\n### 3. **Add Validation Layer**\n```python\ndef validate_extraction(extracted_data, original_text):\n    # Check if extracted values actually exist in the original text\n    for key, value in extracted_data.items():\n        if value and str(value) not in original_text:\n            extracted_data[key] = None\n    return extracted_data\n```\n\n### 4. **Better PDF Processing**\nInstead of relying on ChatGPT's PDF reading:\n- Use PyPDF2 or pdfplumber to extract text first\n- Send the extracted text to the API\n- This gives you more control over what's being processed\n\n### 5. **Use Multiple Passes**\n```python\n# First pass: Extract raw data\n# Second pass: Validate against original\nvalidation_prompt = f\"\"\"\nGiven this invoice text: {pdf_text}\nVerify if these extracted values are correct: {extracted_json}\nCorrect any values that don't appear in the original text.\n\"\"\"\n```\n\nWould you like me to provide a complete implementation example?",

PDF Quality/Format**\n- **Scanned PDFs (images):** The API cannot read images unless you use a Vision model or OCR (Optical Character Recognition).\n- **Text-based PDFs:** If the PDF is text-based, the API can extract data more reliably.\n\n**Solution:**  \n- For scanned/image PDFs, run OCR (e.g., with Tesseract, Adobe, or an API like Google Vision) to convert to text before sending to ChatGPT.\n- For text-based PDFs, extract the text with a Python library (PyPDF2, pdfplumber) and provide only the relevant text to ChatGPT.\n\n**B. Prompt Structure**\n- If your prompt is not specific enough, or if you send the whole PDF content, ChatGPT might get confused.\n\n**Solution:**  \n- **Extract text** from the PDF first.\n- **Send only the invoice-relevant section** (not the whole PDF, especially for multi-page documents).\n- **Prompt example:**\n    ```json\n    Please extract the following fields from the invoice below and return as JSON with these keys: [\"invoice_number\", \"CIF\", \"total\", \"invoice_date\", \"VAT\"]. Use null if a field is missing.\n\n    [PASTE INVOICE TEXT HERE]\n    ```\n\n**C. API Model Limitations**\n- GPT-3.5 has lower context and extraction abilities compared to GPT-4.\n- The 'Vision' models (like GPT-4o, GPT-4-turbo with vision) can process images and PDFs directly, but plain GPT-3.5 cannot.\n\n**Solution:**  \n- If you have access, use GPT-4 with Vision for direct PDF/image support.\n- Otherwise, extract text yourself and then prompt the model.\n\n#### 2. **Output Formatting Issues**\n- Make sure to clearly specify the output format (JSON) and required keys. Sometimes ChatGPT misses keys if the field is absent in the data.\n\n**Prompt tip:**  \n“Return a JSON object with all the following keys: ... If a value is missing, set it to null.”\n\n#### 3. **Token/Context Limit**\n- If the PDF is long, it might exceed the model’s context window, causing missing data.\n\n**Solution:**  \n- Only send the relevant page or section.\n- Use a pre-processing script to extract and summarize sections before sending.\n\n---\n\n### Sample Workflow\n\n1. **Extract text from PDF** (using PyPDF2, pdfplumber, etc.).\n2. **Pre-process text** to isolate the invoice data.\n3. **Prompt ChatGPT:**\n    ```\n    Extract these fields from the invoice text and output as JSON: invoice_number, CIF, total, invoice_date, VAT.\n    If a field is missing, set its value to null.\n\n    [Paste invoice text here]\n    ```\n4. **Review/validate** the JSON output.\n\n---\n\n### If you share a sample invoice text (with sensitive data redacted), I can help you craft a precise prompt or code snippet.\n\nLet me know where exactly the issue occurs (missing fields, wrong format, partial data, etc.), and I’ll help you troubleshoot further!",

          "response": "It sounds like you’re running into a couple of related constraints or pitfalls when trying to extract structured data directly from a PDF file via ChatGPT (or the OpenAI API). Below are some key points to consider and steps you can try to improve results:\n\n1. ChatGPT does not inherently “read” PDFs.  \n   • The model can only process textual input. If you are passing a binary PDF file or simply uploading the PDF to ChatGPT, it does not automatically extract the full text from each section of the PDF.  \n   • If your PDF is a scanned image (i.e., non-searchable text), OCR (optical character recognition) is required first to convert the image regions to actual text.\n\n2. Pre-extract text from the PDF.  \n   • Use a library or tool (e.g., PyPDF2, pdfplumber, pdftotext, or an OCR tool if scanned) to convert the invoice into raw text. You can then feed that raw text into ChatGPT.  \n   • Once you have the raw text, you can prompt ChatGPT more effectively, for example: \n     “Here is the text from an invoice. Please extract invoiceNumber, CIF, total, date, VAT, and return them in valid JSON: <invoice text here>”\n\n3. Keep token limits in mind.  \n   • Large PDFs can exceed ChatGPT’s token limit. If the raw text is very long, you may need to split it (e.g., by pages or sections) and process it in chunks.  \n   • Make sure your prompt is not too big. If the text plus the prompt is larger than the model’s token limit, the model may truncate or skip parts of the data.\n\n4. Prompt structuring tips.  \n   • Be explicit about the output format.  \n   • For example, you can say:  \n     “Please extract the following fields from the invoice text: 'invoiceNumber', 'CIF', 'total', 'date', and 'VAT'. Return ONLY valid JSON, with each field as the key, for example:  \n     {  \n       \"invoiceNumber\": \"...\",  \n       \"CIF\": \"...\",  \n       \"total\": \"...\",  \n       \"date\": \"...\",  \n       \"VAT\": \"...\"  \n     }”  \n   • Emphasize that you want no additional commentary—only valid JSON.\n\n5. Use function calling (if you have access to OpenAI function-calling).  \n   • You can define a function schema that enforces the JSON keys you want—e.g., invoiceNumber, CIF, total, date, etc.  \n   • Send your prompt as normal but include a function call definition. The model then returns structured JSON in the correct format automatically.\n\n6. Verify whether the data exists.  \n   • If the PDF simply doesn’t contain the fields you’re asking for, ChatGPT will either omit them or hallucinate. Make sure the PDF truly has those fields or that you’re prompting for data easily recognized in the text.  \n   • If something is not in the text (e.g., the invoice does not have a VAT field explicitly), ChatGPT may leave that key empty or guess. Inspect the actual PDF text carefully.\n\n7. Double-check your prompt clarity.  \n   • If your prompt says something like “extract the invoice data” without clarifying exactly what fields and in what format, ChatGPT may provide a partial or incomplete answer.  \n   • Also, if you are mixing text from multiple sources into your prompt, you might confuse the model about which content belongs to the invoice.\n\nPutting this all together:\n1) Run the PDF through a parser or OCR tool.  \n2) Copy (or stream) the parsed text into your prompt.  \n3) Formulate a concise request: exactly which fields are needed and in what JSON schema.  \n4) If needed, split large documents and repeat the extraction chunk by chunk.  \n5) Use function calling or carefully structured prompts to ensure you get consistent JSON back.\n\nFollowing these steps should drastically improve your invoice-data extraction so that ChatGPT (or the OpenAI API) returns all the specified fields in a valid JSON format.",

Use exactly these keys: …. If a value is not found, output null or an empty string.” Providing this level of specificity can improve consistency.\n\n3. • Template Consistency:\n  – Real-world invoices can vary widely in layout and phrasing. If your prompt is based on a sample invoice but your “real” invoices are formatted differently, ChatGPT might have difficulty locating the fields.\n  – You might need to adjust your prompt instructions or include multiple examples that cover the range of invoice formats you expect to encounter.\n\n4. • Data Volume and Token Limits:\n  – If the PDF’s text is long, ensure that the amount of text you send does not exceed the model’s token limits.\n  – Sometimes, when too much text is provided, the model may “cut off” parts of output or lose track of the required structure. In such cases, preprocessing to extract only the relevant sections of the invoice can help.\n\n5. • API Limitations and Model Behavior:\n  – Remember that while ChatGPT is very powerful, it’s not a dedicated data extraction or OCR tool. For highly structured extraction, you may need to combine preprocessing tools (like optical character recognition or template matching algorithms) to provide a cleaner input.\n  – Sometimes the nature of language generation means the output might “hallucinate” or skip fields. Reiterating the requirements in follow-up prompts or using a “chain-of-thought” approach might help.\n\n6. • Testing and Iteration:\n  – Test with a simplified example first. If you can successfully extract all the required keys from a clean, known input, then gradually increase complexity.\n  – Adjust your prompt based on the errors you see. For example, ask “Please include the key ‘VATRATE’ even if you don’t find a value, and output null in that case” to force the inclusion of every key.\n\nIn summary, the issue is likely due to a combination of how the PDF content is extracted, the variability in the PDF’s layout, and the prompt instructions provided to ChatGPT. I recommend:\n\n• Converting your PDF invoice to a clean text format beforehand.\n• Refining your prompt to include explicit instructions and examples of the desired JSON structure.\n• Possibly using a two-step approach: first extract the text via a dedicated OCR or PDF extraction tool, then pass the cleaned-up text to ChatGPT for parsing into JSON.\n\nTry these approaches and see if you get a more consistent, complete JSON output. If you continue to have issues, providing an anonymized example of a PDF’s extracted text along with your prompt might help diagnose the problem further.",

          "response": "It seems your message was cut off. However, I believe I understand your issue—you're using OpenAI's API (such as ChatGPT) to extract structured data (invoice number, CIF, total amount, date, VAT, etc.) from PDF invoices and requesting the output as JSON. But you encounter problems where the returned JSON includes data that doesn't accurately reflect what's in the PDF, or is incomplete or contains incorrect information.\n\nThis is a common challenge when using a Large Language Model (LLM) to directly parse and extract structured information from complex or scanned documents like invoices. Let’s first clarify why this happens, and then I’ll suggest some practical solutions:\n\n### Why this happens:\n1. **PDF Parsing Issues**: PDFs often store content in complex layouts, making direct extraction challenging. If the PDF is scanned or image-based, the model might not correctly read the text without OCR preprocessing.\n2. **Ambiguous Instructions**: If the extraction instructions are ambiguous, the model might guess or fill in incorrect or incomplete info.\n3. **Hallucinations (Model guessing)**: GPT models tend to occasionally produce plausible-looking incorrect data (\"hallucinations\") when unsure or when the data isn't clearly parsed.\n\n### Recommended Solutions:\n\n### 1. Preprocess PDFs with OCR and Text Extraction:\n- **OCR (Optical Character Recognition)**: Tools like Tesseract OCR, AWS Textract, Google Vision OCR, Azure OCR, or commercial solutions like Abbyy FineReader can convert scanned PDFs into clean text outputs.\n- **Structured Text Extraction**: Use PDF parsing libraries to extract structured text first (examples: PyMuPDF, pdfplumber, PDFminer, PyPDF2).\n\n### 2. Provide Clear, Structured Prompts:\nClearly instruct the model exactly what fields you require. Example prompt:\n\n```\nExtract the following invoice data from the provided invoice content. Return the data strictly in JSON format with the keys:\n- invoice_number\n- CIF\n- invoice_date\n- total_amount\n- VAT_amount\n- currency\n\nIf a field is not found, return \"null\" for that field. Do not include any explanations or additional text.\n```\n\n### 3. Use a Two-Step Process:\n- **Step 1:** Extract raw text or OCR the PDF externally.\n- **Step 2:** Provide the cleaned text to ChatGPT (or your API call) with a structured prompt to extract JSON-formatted data accurately.\n\n### 4. Consider Fine-tuning or Specialized APIs:\n- **Fine-tune GPT-style models** specifically on invoice extraction tasks (requires labeled data).\n- **Use specialized APIs**: For invoice-specific extraction (e.g., Azure Form Recognizer, Amazon Textract, Google Document AI), which often give more accurate results than generic LLM extraction.\n\n### 5. Post-processing Validation:\nImplement rules and validation checks after extraction to ensure the invoice number, CIF, totals, and dates meet expected formats. \n\n### Example workflow for reliable extraction:\n```  \nPDF Invoice → OCR extraction (Tesseract, AWS Textract, Google Vision) → Cleaned Text → GPT API Call (with structured prompt) → JSON response → Post-validation logic (regex/date/number validation) → Final JSON structured data\n```\n\n---\n\nCould you please confirm:\n- Whether your PDFs are scanned images (OCR required) or standard, text-based PDFs?\n- Your current method of preprocessing or any libraries you're using?\n- The exact prompt you currently use?\n\nThis information will help me give you more precise recommendations.",

          "response": "Certainly! Here’s a step-by-step breakdown of your scenario and the challenges you’re facing when using OpenAI’s API (and ChatGPT web) to extract structured data from PDF invoices:\n\n**1. Your Goal**  \nYou want to extract specific fields (e.g., invoice number, CIF, total, dates, VAT) from PDF invoices and receive the output as a structured JSON object using OpenAI’s API or ChatGPT web.\n\n**2. Your Process**  \n- You upload a real PDF invoice (possibly by copy-pasting the text, or if using the API, maybe by converting the PDF to text first).\n- You prompt ChatGPT to extract invoice data and output it as JSON, specifying the desired keys.\n\n**3. The Problem**  \n- The output you receive is not strictly JSON. Instead, it may include extra text, explanations, or it does not extract the data correctly.\n- Sometimes, the result might mix in hallucinated values or fail to find the correct fields.\n\n---\n\n## Why This Happens\n\n**A. PDF Extraction Limitation:**  \n- ChatGPT does not natively read PDF files. You (or a tool) must first convert the PDF to readable text. This process is error-prone: data might be lost, formatting gets broken, or fields become hard to parse.\n\n**B. Prompting Limitations:**  \n- ChatGPT is designed for conversational output. Unless you instruct it very clearly, it might add explanations or not format the output as strict JSON.\n- If the prompt is not explicit, the model may return extra context or explanations.\n\n**C. Model Limitations:**  \n- If the extracted text is messy or lacks clear labels (e.g., “Invoice number: 12345”), the model may misinterpret or miss data.\n- The model sometimes \"hallucinates\" values if it cannot find them clearly in the text.\n\n---\n\n## Step-by-Step Solution\n\n### Step 1: **Convert PDF to Text Reliably**\n- Use a robust PDF parser (e.g., pdfplumber, PyPDF2, or Adobe Acrobat) to extract the text.\n- Inspect the output to ensure all relevant fields are present and clearly labeled.\n\n### Step 2: **Craft a Precise Prompt**\n- Instruct the model strictly:  \n  \"Extract the following fields from the text below. Output only valid JSON with these keys: invoice_number, CIF, total, date, VAT, etc. Do not include any extra text or explanation.\"\n- Example prompt:\n\n  ```\n  Extract the following fields from this invoice text: invoice_number, CIF, total, date, VAT. Output as a JSON object with these keys only. Do not include any extra explanation.\n\n  [PASTE INVOICE TEXT HERE]\n  ```\n\n### Step 3: **Add Output Constraints (API Option)**\n- When using the API, you can use function calling or JSON mode (if available) to force the output into strict JSON.\n- If using ChatGPT web, enable \"JSON Mode\" if available (in GPT-4 Turbo, for example).\n\n### Step 4: **Post-process the Output**\n- Parse the response. If extra text is present, use code to extract the JSON portion.\n- Validate the JSON and handle exceptions.\n\n### Step 5: **Iterate & Refine**\n- If the model still returns non-JSON output, further clarify your prompt, for example:  \n  \"Output ONLY the JSON. Do not include any other text.\"\n- You can add “If a value is missing, use null.”\n\n---\n\n## Additional Tips\n\n- **Field Labels:** Make sure the extracted text has clear field labels. If not, consider regex pre-processing to add them.\n- **Redaction:** Remove sensitive information to avoid privacy issues.\n- **Data Validation:** Post-process and validate data types (e.g., date format, number format).\n- **Fine-tuning:** For frequent or high-accuracy use, consider fine-tuning the model on your invoice formats.\n\n---\n\n## Example Prompt\n\n```\nExtract the following fields from this invoice text: \n- invoice_number\n- CIF\n- total\n- date\n- VAT\n\nReturn ONLY a valid JSON object with these keys. If a value is missing, use null. Do not include any other text.\n\n[INVOICE TEXT]\n```\n\n---\n\n**Summary Table: Common Issues and Solutions**\n\n| Issue                                | Solution                                             |\n|---------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|\n| Extra text/explanation in output      | Use strict prompt; enable JSON mode if possible      |\n| Missed fields/incorrect data          | Improve PDF-to-text quality; clarify prompt          |\n| Hallucinated values                   | Instruct to use null if value not found              |\n| Non-JSON response                     | Post-process or use API function/JSON mode           |\n| Formatting issues from extraction     | Preprocess text, ensure clear field labels           |\n\n---\n\n**If you share a sample of the extracted text and your prompt, I can help you refine the prompt or suggest parsing techniques!**",

          "response": "Below is a step-by-step breakdown of one approach to extracting structured JSON data (with keys like invoice number, CIF, total, dates, VAT, etc.) from PDF invoices using OpenAI’s API or ChatGPT on the web. This breakdown also addresses why you might sometimes get extra data in the output and how to improve your results.\n\n──────────────────────────────\n1. Prepare the PDF Invoice for Processing\n\n• Extract the Text from the PDF:\n  – Since ChatGPT doesn’t process PDF files directly, you need to convert your PDF invoice into plain text.\n  – Use a reliable PDF-to-text converter or OCR (if the PDF is scanned) to obtain a clean text output.\n  \n• Clean Up the Extracted Data:\n  – Remove artifacts or extra formatting issues. This makes it easier for the model to locate the data fields.\n\n──────────────────────────────\n2. Define the Data Fields You Need\n\n• List Out Specific Keys:\n  – Determine which fields you want extracted. For example: invoice_number, CIF, total, invoice_date, due_date, VAT, etc.\n  \n• Note Any Variations:\n  – If the PDF may use different formats or label these fields slightly differently, note these variations so you can instruct the model accordingly.\n\n──────────────────────────────\n3. Craft a Precise Prompt\n\n• Write Clear Instructions for Extraction:\n  – Clearly state that the output must be in JSON format.\n  – Explicitly list the expected keys.\n  – For example:\n  \n  \"Extract the following data from the provided text: invoice number, CIF, total, invoice date, due date, VAT. Please return only a JSON object with these keys. Do not include any extra commentary, explanations, or additional keys. The JSON format should be:\n  \n  {\n    'invoice_number': '...',\n    'cif': '...',\n    'total': '...',\n    'invoice_date': '...',\n    'due_date': '...',\n    'vat': '...'\n  }\"\n  \n• Emphasize Output Strictness:\n  – You can add instructions like \"Respond with only the JSON without any surrounding text\" to discourage extra narrative.\n\n──────────────────────────────\n4. Input the Data to ChatGPT or Send the API Request\n\n• Using ChatGPT Web:\n  – Copy the cleaned PDF text.\n  – Paste it into the chat along with your clear prompt.\n  \n• Using OpenAI’s API:\n  – Include the text and prompt in your API call as the ‘prompt’ parameter.\n  – Make sure your call’s instructions (perhaps via system messages) are clear that the entire output must be JSON without additional commentary.\n\n──────────────────────────────\n5. Handling Extra or Unwanted Data in the Output\n\n• Why Extra Data Might Appear:\n  – ChatGPT sometimes “thinks” additional context or clarifications may help, so it may include commentary outside of the JSON block.\n  – The model might even include explanations or formatting instructions that you did not ask for.\n  \n• Strategies to Avoid It:\n  – Reiterate in your prompt that the answer should contain nothing except the JSON object.\n  – Example addition: \"Do not include any extra text, explanations, or formatting outside the JSON.\"\n  – If using the API, you may use “system” instructions in combination with your prompt to further lock the style.\n  \n• Post-Processing:\n  – If extra data still appears, consider writing a short script to extract the JSON block from the response programmatically.\n    \n──────────────────────────────\n6. Validate the JSON Output\n\n• Check the JSON Structure:\n  – Once you receive the result, use a JSON validator or parser to ensure the output is valid JSON.\n  \n• Verify Data Accuracy:\n  – Confirm that each key has the correct value (for example, the correct invoice number, CIF, and other details).\n  \n• Iterate if Needed:\n  – If some fields are missing, adjust your prompt to be even more specific about which text relates to which JSON key.\n\n──────────────────────────────\n7. Troubleshooting and Iteration\n\n• Experiment with Prompt Variations:\n  – If the invoice text has unusual formatting or multiple numbers and dates, the model might get “confused.”\n  – You might need to include hints in your prompt, like “The invoice number is a sequence of digits following the phrase 'Invoice No:'” to help the model pinpoint the data.\n  \n• Testing with Multiple Invoices:\n  – Run your prompt and process on several invoices to see if the model’s extraction is consistent.\n  \n• Refine Extraction Logic:\n  – In some cases, a bit of post-processing (e.g., using regular expressions in your own code) may be necessary to finalize the clean JSON output.\n\n──────────────────────────────\nSummary\n\nBy following these steps—converting the PDF to text, identifying the necessary fields, crafting an unambiguous prompt that demands only JSON output, and validating the results—you can increase the likelihood that ChatGPT (or the API) returns strictly the JSON data you require. The key is to be as explicit as possible in your instructions so that the AI does not include any additional commentary or extraneous data.",

          "response": "To extract data from PDF invoices using OpenAI's API (and ChatGPT web), you can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Prepare the PDF Invoice**: Ensure that the PDF invoice you want to extract data from is in a format that can be easily processed by the API. This typically means the invoice should be clear, well-structured, and have the necessary information in a consistent format.\n\n2. **Set up the OpenAI API**: Follow the OpenAI API documentation to obtain an API key and set up the necessary environment to make API requests. This may involve installing the OpenAI Python library or setting up the API endpoint in your preferred programming language.\n\n3. **Formulate the API Request**: Prepare the API request that will be sent to the OpenAI API. This typically involves the following steps:\n   - Encode the PDF invoice into a base64 string format.\n   - Prepare the API request payload, which should include the base64-encoded PDF and any other necessary parameters, such as the desired output format (e.g., JSON) and the specific keys you want to extract (e.g., invoice number, CIF, total, dates, VAT).\n   - Send the API request to the OpenAI endpoint using the appropriate HTTP method (e.g., POST).\n\n4. **Process the API Response**: Once the API request is sent, you should receive a response from the OpenAI API. This response will likely contain the extracted data in the requested format (e.g., JSON). You can then parse and process the response to extract the specific data you need, such as the invoice number, CIF, total, dates, and VAT.\n\n5. **Handle Potential Issues**: When working with real-world PDF invoices, you may encounter issues such as inconsistent formatting, missing data, or unexpected data structures. Be prepared to handle these cases and implement error handling and validation mechanisms in your code to ensure the extracted data is accurate and reliable.\n\nHere's a high-level example of how you might implement this process in Python using the OpenAI API:\n\n```python\nimport openai\nimport base64\n\n# Set up the OpenAI API\nopenai.api_key = \"your_openai_api_key\"\n\n# Load the PDF invoice\nwith open(\"invoice.pdf\", \"rb\") as file:\n    pdf_data = file.read()\n\n# Encode the PDF data to base64\npdf_base64 = base64.b64encode(pdf_data).decode(\"utf-8\")\n\n# Prepare the API request payload\npayload = {\n    \"document\": pdf_base64,\n    \"output_format\": \"json\",\n    \"extract_keys\": [\"invoice_number\", \"cif\", \"total\", \"date\", \"vat\"]\n}\n\n# Send the API request\nresponse = openai.Completion.create(\n    engine=\"text-davinci-002\",\n    prompt=\"Extract the following data from the PDF invoice: invoice_number, cif, total, date, vat\",\n    max_tokens=1024,\n    n=1,\n    stop=None,\n    temperature=0.5,\n    input=payload\n)\n\n# Process the API response\nextracted_data = response.choices[0].text\nprint(extracted_data)\n```\n\nThis is a simplified example, and you may need to adjust the code based on the specific requirements of your use case and the format of the PDF invoices you are working with. Additionally, you may need to handle errors and edge cases, such as when the API response does not contain the expected data or when the PDF invoice is not in the expected format.",

Voici quelques conseils et exemples pour optimiser l’extraction de données structurées à partir de factures PDF avec une sortie JSON propre :\n\n### 1. Préparation du texte :\n- **Conversion PDF vers texte** : Utilisez un outil comme [pdfplumber](https://github.com/jsvine/pdfplumber), [PyPDF2](https://pypi.org/project/PyPDF2/), ou un OCR si le PDF est scanné, pour obtenir le texte de la facture.\n- **Nettoyage** : Assurez-vous que le texte extrait est lisible, sans sauts de page inutiles ni caractères spéciaux.\n\n### 2. Prompt d’extraction pour l’API OpenAI :\nFormulez un prompt clair et concis, indiquant exactement les champs souhaités.\n\n**Exemple de prompt :**\n\n```text\nVoici le texte extrait d'une facture PDF :\n\n[Insérez ici le texte de la facture]\n\nVeuillez extraire les informations suivantes et les retourner UNIQUEMENT au format JSON, sans explication ni texte supplémentaire :\n{\n  \"numéro_facture\": \"\",\n  \"CIF\": \"\",\n  \"total_HT\": \"\",\n  \"total_TTC\": \"\",\n  \"date_facture\": \"\",\n  \"date_échéance\": \"\",\n  \"TVA\": \"\",\n  \"nom_client\": \"\",\n  \"adresse_client\": \"\",\n  \"nom_fournisseur\": \"\",\n  \"adresse_fournisseur\": \"\"\n}\nSi une information est manquante, laissez la valeur vide.\n```\n\n### 3. Appel de l’API avec un modèle adapté :\n- Utilisez GPT-3.5-turbo ou GPT-4-turbo, qui sont très performants pour la compréhension de texte.\n- Placez le texte de la facture dans le contexte du prompt, ou utilisez la fonction [function calling](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/function-calling) pour forcer le respect du format.\n\n### 4. Post-traitement :\n- Vérifiez que la sortie est bien du JSON.\n- Gérez les erreurs ou champs manquants.\n\n---\n\n### Exemple de code Python (avec l’API OpenAI) :\n\n```python\nimport openai\n\ntexte_facture = \"COLLEZ ICI LE TEXTE EXTRAIT\"\n\nprompt = f\"\"\"\nVoici le texte extrait d'une facture PDF :\n\n{texte_facture}\n\nVeuillez extraire les informations suivantes et les retourner UNIQUEMENT au format JSON, sans explication ni texte supplémentaire :\n{{\n  \"numéro_facture\": \"\",\n  \"CIF\": \"\",\n  \"total_HT\": \"\",\n  \"total_TTC\": \"\",\n  \"date_facture\": \"\",\n  \"date_échéance\": \"\",\n  \"TVA\": \"\",\n  \"nom_client\": \"\",\n  \"adresse_client\": \"\",\n  \"nom_fournisseur\": \"\",\n  \"adresse_fournisseur\": \"\"\n}}\nSi une information est manquante, laissez la valeur vide.\n\"\"\"\n\nresponse = openai.ChatCompletion.create(\n    model=\"gpt-4-turbo\",  # ou \"gpt-3.5-turbo\"\n    messages=[{\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": prompt}],\n    temperature=0\n)\n\nprint(response['choices'][0]['message']['content'])\n```\n\n---\n\n### Conseils :\n- **Tests** : Essayez avec plusieurs factures, car la structure des PDF peut varier.\n- **Limite de tokens** : Si le texte est long, coupez ou résumez le texte aux sections importantes (en-tête, tableau des totaux).\n- **Langue** : Si certaines factures sont en d’autres langues, précisez-le dans le prompt.\n- **Validation** : Utilisez `json.loads()` pour vérifier la validité du JSON retourné.\n\n---\n\nN’hésitez pas à partager un exemple de texte extrait ou à préciser vos difficultés pour aller plus loin dans le détail !",

          "response": "Bonjour !\n\nSi je comprends bien, vous souhaitez obtenir des conseils pour configurer votre appel à l'API OpenAI (ou pour formuler vos prompts) de sorte que, lorsqu'il traite une facture PDF, la réponse soit systématiquement structurée en JSON avec des clés précises (par exemple, numéro de facture, CIF, total, dates, TVA, etc.).\n\nVoici quelques conseils et un exemple de prompt pour vous guider :\n\n──────────────────────────────\n1. Précision du contexte et de l'objectif  \n──────────────────────────────\nIndiquez clairement dans votre prompt que vous travaillez avec une facture (ou un document similaire) et que vous souhaitez extraire des informations spécifiques. Par exemple :  \n• Le numéro de facture  \n• Le CIF (ou identifiant fiscal)  \n• Le total (montant global)  \n• Les dates (date d’émission, éventuellement date d’échéance)  \n• La TVA (montant et taux)  \n…et toute autre donnée utile.\n\n──────────────────────────────\n2. Spécification du format de sortie  \n──────────────────────────────\nPour garantir que la réponse soit au format JSON, demandez explicitement quelque chose comme :  \n\"Merci de répondre uniquement au format JSON en utilisant les clés suivantes : ...\"  \nCela permet de réduire les variations dans la réponse.\n\n──────────────────────────────\n3. Exemple de prompt  \n──────────────────────────────\nVous pourriez essayer un prompt similaire à celui-ci (en adaptant selon vos besoins) :\n\n---------------------------------------------------------\nContexte :  \nVous êtes un extracteur de données spécialisé dans les factures au format PDF. Vous devez extraire les informations suivantes d’une facture donnée :\n\n- numero_facture : le numéro unique de la facture\n- cif : le code d’identification fiscal\n- total : le montant total de la facture (hors ou TTC, selon le contexte)\n- date_emission : la date d’émission de la facture\n- date_echeance (si applicable) : la date limite de paiement\n- tva : le montant ou le taux de taxe sur la valeur ajoutée\n\nDonnées à traiter :  \n[Insérez ici le contenu textuel extrait du PDF de la facture.]\n\nInstruction :  \nAnalysez le texte ci-dessus et extrayez les informations en produisant une sortie exclusivement en format JSON avec les clés spécifiées. Si une information n’est pas présente, indiquez-la avec la valeur null.\n\nExemple de format de sortie attendu :\n\n{\n  \"numero_facture\": \"EX123456\",\n  \"cif\": \"123456789\",\n  \"total\": \"1000.00\",\n  \"date_emission\": \"2023-03-15\",\n  \"date_echeance\": \"2023-04-15\",\n  \"tva\": \"20%\"\n}\n\nMerci d'extraire précisément ces données à partir du texte fourni.\n---------------------------------------------------------\n\n──────────────────────────────\n4. Points à considérer  \n──────────────────────────────\n• Assurez-vous que le contenu textuel extrait du PDF soit suffisamment propre et structuré (même s'il s'agit d'un bloc de texte brut).  \n• Effectuez éventuellement une post-validation côté serveur pour vérifier que la chaîne JSON produite est bien conforme aux attentes (par exemple avec un parseur JSON).  \n• En cas de difficulté d’extraction ou d’ambiguïté, vous pourriez envisager de faire plusieurs passes ou ajuster le prompt pour chaque type d'information.\n\n──────────────────────────────\nConclusion  \n──────────────────────────────\nEn fournissant un prompt aussi détaillé, vous augmentez la probabilité que le modèle génère une réponse au format JSON conforme à vos besoins. N’hésitez pas à tester et itérer sur votre prompt pour obtenir la meilleure extraction possible en fonction de la diversité des factures que vous traitez.\n\nSi vous avez des questions supplémentaires ou besoin d’ajuster un aspect précis, dites-moi !",

          "response": "下面给出一种通用思路，帮助您使用 OpenAI API（或 ChatGPT）从 PDF 发票中提取所需字段，并且仅返回包含指定键与值的 JSON 格式输出。您可以根据自己的技术栈和业务需求选择适合的实现方式。\n\n----------------------------------------\n1. 提取 PDF 文本\n----------------------------------------\n在将 PDF 发票文本传递给 OpenAI 进行处理之前，首先需要将 PDF 转换为可读的文本。可以使用以下几种常见的第三方库来提取文本：\n\n• Python pdfminer.six\n• Python PyMuPDF (fitz)\n• Apache Tika\n• 其他商业/开源的 OCR 工具（如 PDF 中是扫描件，则需 OCR）\n\n代码示例（基于 Python pdfminer.six）：\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nfrom pdfminer.high_level import extract_text\n\npdf_file_path = \"your_invoice.pdf\"\nextracted_text = extract_text(pdf_file_path)\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n此时，extracted_text 中就是 PDF 中提取的纯文本。如果 PDF 存在复杂排版或是扫描件，可能需要更多的预处理或正则清洗。\n\n----------------------------------------\n2. 为 ChatGPT 设计提示 (Prompt)\n----------------------------------------\n要让 ChatGPT 或其他 OpenAI 模型仅输出指定键的 JSON，需要在提示（Prompt）中明确要求：\n1. 给出您希望提取的字段及其含义，示例包括：\n   • invoice_number\n   • CIF\n   • total\n   • date\n   • vat\n2. 要求返回时只输出 JSON，且包含特定的字段，不要额外的文本说明或解释。\n\n一个示例 Prompt（以 ChatGPT API 为例）可以写成：\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nSYSTEM 或 USER 提示:\n\"下面是一段发票文本。请抽取以下字段并返回一个 JSON 对象，字段包括：\n1. invoice_number\n2. CIF\n3. total\n4. date\n5. vat\n\n请保证仅输出 JSON，不要包含任何额外注释或文本。\"\n\n<把提取到的 PDF 文本 pasted/拼接 到这里>\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n您可以根据业务需要进行微调。关键点在于：\n• 必须让模型知道您需要的字段名称以及返回格式。  \n• 明确说明「只输出 JSON」，避免模型添加说明性文字。  \n• 给模型提供足够的上下文信息，比如发票欣赏的模板/示例，让模型能够更准确定位字段。  \n\n----------------------------------------\n3. 结合 OpenAI API 调用\n----------------------------------------\n若使用 Python 代码调用 OpenAI 的 GPT-3.5/GPT-4 API，可参照以下示例（仅供参考，具体根据实际依赖版本不同稍作调整）：\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nimport os\nimport openai\n\nopenai.api_key = os.getenv(\"OPENAI_API_KEY\")\n\ndef extract_invoice_data_from_text(text: str) -> str:\n    prompt = f\"\"\"\n下面是一段发票文本。请抽取以下字段并返回一个 JSON 对象，字段包括：\n- \"invoice_number\"\n- \"CIF\"\n- \"total\"\n- \"date\"\n- \"vat\"\n\n请保证 仅输出 JSON 等键值对，不要包含任何额外文本。\n\n发票文本:\n{text}\n\"\"\"\n\n    # 调用 ChatCompletion 接口\n    response = openai.ChatCompletion.create(\n        model=\"gpt-4\",  # 或者 gpt-3.5-turbo\n        messages=[\n            {\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": prompt}\n        ],\n        temperature=0,\n    )\n    \n    # 从 response 中获取返回文本\n    answer = response[\"choices\"][0][\"message\"][\"content\"]\n    return answer\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    # 第一步：提取 PDF 文本\n    from pdfminer.high_level import extract_text\n    pdf_text = extract_text(\"your_invoice.pdf\")\n    \n    # 第二步：调用 ChatGPT\n    json_output = extract_invoice_data_from_text(pdf_text)\n    \n    # 第三步：验证结果\n    print(\"提取的 JSON:\")\n    print(json_output)\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n将上面的 json_output 输出即可得到类似如下结果（示例，仅供参考）：\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n{\n  \"invoice_number\": \"INV-12345\",\n  \"CIF\": \"B12345678\",\n  \"total\": \"250.00\",\n  \"date\": \"2023-10-01\",\n  \"vat\": \"21%\"\n}\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n----------------------------------------\n4. 常见注意事项\n----------------------------------------\n1. PDF 格式的复杂程度  \n   如果 PDF 布局较复杂或者包含大量表格内容，需要对提取后的文本进行更多清洗/分段处理，或者使用更智能的 PDF 解析工具（如某些专用的 OCR + 布局分析库）。\n\n2. 模型提示的上下文长度限制  \n   如果发票文本较长，确保不要超过模型的 token 限制。对于 GPT-3.5 大约 4K tokens，GPT-4 也有不同的限制版本。可以考虑只传输发票中可能包含关键信息的部分（如标题区域、发票汇总信息区域、卖方/买方信息等），减少 token 浪费。\n\n3. 审核与异常处理  \n   有时候模型可能会出现无法正确匹配字段或输出格式不标准的情况。需要对返回结果进行 JSON 解析并做验证。如果字段缺失或值为空，可以添加后续逻辑处理或提示用户进行纠正。\n\n4. 提升抽取准确度的思路  \n   • 可以提供“样例发票文本”与“期望输出 JSON”的示例，让模型学习此映射。  \n   • 若字段较多且排布不规则，可以使用更强大的结构化数据抽取的微调模型或插件。  \n\n----------------------------------------\n总结\n----------------------------------------\n• 您可以先使用 Python 库把 PDF 转成纯文本。  \n• 然后将文本拼接到包含提取字段要求的 Prompt 中，调用 OpenAI ChatCompletion API。  \n• 最后把模型返回的纯 JSON 字符串进行解析或存储到数据库中。  \n• 关键点是使用适当的提示语，要求模型「仅输出带指定键的 JSON」，并进行必要的后处理与异常处理。\n\n希望以上步骤能帮助您使用 OpenAI API（包括 ChatGPT）提取 PDF 发票中的特定字段并得到纯 JSON 格式的输出。如有更多疑问或需要更详细的定制实现，欢迎再与我讨论。祝一切顺利!",

Пожалуйста, уточните, с чем именно возникла сложность при работе с API OpenAI и WebGPT для извлечения данных из PDF-счетов:\n\n- В чем заключается проблема? (например, модель не извлекает нужные ключи, JSON-ответ некорректен, данные теряются, не распознаются некоторые поля и т.д.)\n- Какой способ загрузки PDF вы используете? (например, конвертируете в текст самостоятельно или используете сторонние инструменты)\n- Какой prompt (запрос) вы отправляете в модель?\n- Какой результат вы получаете на выходе (пример вывода, если есть ошибки — их текст)?\n\nЕсли опишете детали, я смогу предложить более точное решение.\n\n**Общие рекомендации по вашей задаче:**\n\n1. **Конвертация PDF в текст:**  \n   Модели OpenAI (например, GPT-4, WebGPT) не умеют напрямую читать PDF-файлы. Сначала нужно конвертировать PDF в текстовый формат (например, с помощью PyPDF2, pdfplumber или Adobe API).  \n   Пример на Python:\n   ```python\n   import pdfplumber\n   with pdfplumber.open('invoice.pdf') as pdf:\n       text = ''\n       for page in pdf.pages:\n           text += page.extract_text()\n   ```\n2. **Составление правильного prompt:**  \n   После получения текста из счета, отправляйте его в чат-модель с четкой инструкцией:\n   ```\n   Вот текст счета:\n   [ВСТАВЬТЕ ТЕКСТ]\n   \n   Извлеки следующие данные в формате JSON с ключами: \"invoice_number\", \"CIF\", \"total_amount\", \"date\", \"VAT\" и т.д.\n   Пример ответа:\n   {\n     \"invoice_number\": \"...\",\n     \"CIF\": \"...\",\n     \"total_amount\": \"...\",\n     \"date\": \"...\",\n     \"VAT\": \"...\"\n   }\n   ```\n3. **Ограничение объема данных:**  \n   GPT-модели имеют лимит токенов. Если счет большой, отправляйте только нужные страницы или фрагменты.\n\n4. **Проверка и пост-обработка:**  \n   Всегда валидируйте полученный JSON (например, через json.loads в Python) и при необходимости обрабатывайте ошибки.\n\n5. **Если возникает проблема с качеством распознавания:**  \n   - Попробуйте улучшить качество извлекаемого текста (например, используйте OCR для сканов).\n   - Четче формулируйте запрос в prompt (например, просите не писать ничего кроме JSON).\n\nЕсли пришлёте конкретный пример вашего запроса и ответа — помогу доработать prompt или обработку данных!",

Hallucinated or Incorrect Data:**  \nChatGPT may output plausible-looking, but incorrect or hallucinated values if the PDF content is not parsed correctly or is ambiguous.\n\n**2. Formatting Issues:**  \nThe model may include extra text, explanations, or not strictly follow the JSON schema you requested.\n\n**3. Incomplete Extraction:**  \nSome fields may be missing if the model can’t find them in the PDF or if the PDF parsing step doesn’t extract the data correctly.\n\n**Possible Solutions:**\n\n- **Use a PDF-to-text tool:**  \nBefore passing the content to ChatGPT, use a robust PDF-to-text extraction tool (such as pdfplumber, PyMuPDF, or Adobe PDF Services) to get accurate plain text. Then, ask ChatGPT to extract the data from this text.\n\n- **Prompt Engineering:**  \nBe very explicit in your prompt. For example:\nExtract the following fields from the provided invoice text and output only a valid JSON object: invoice_number, CIF, total, invoice_date, due_date, VAT. Only use information found in the provided text. If a field is missing, set its value to null. Do not add any commentary.\n\n- **Set Up Output Constraints:**  \nIf possible, use the function calling feature (via the OpenAI API) or the JSON mode (available in ChatGPT Plus) to better constrain output format.\n\n- **Double-check with Regex:**  \nAfter receiving the response, you can use code to validate and correct the JSON, or even post-process the plain text with regex to extract certain fields.\n\n**If you share the rest of your original message or an example of the problematic output, I can give more targeted advice!**",

          "response": "When asking GPT-based models (through either the ChatGPT web interface or the API) to extract structured data from longer or more complex documents (e.g., PDF invoices), you may encounter “hallucination”—i.e., the model generates made-up or incorrect data. Below are several strategies one can use to improve the accuracy and reliability of extracting JSON data from invoices:\n\n──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n1. Retrieve the invoice text cleanly before sending it to GPT\n──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n• Conversion to text: Convert the invoice PDF to raw text before feeding it to the language model. PDF conversion sometimes fails to preserve layout, or merges lines, so it’s essential to use a robust PDF-to-text tool. Popular Python libraries:\n  – pdfplumber\n  – PyPDF2\n  – Tesseract OCR (if your PDF is a scan and not digitally generated)\n\n• Pre-cleaning/parsing: Remove irrelevant whitespace, headers, footers, or repeated data that might confuse the model. If the text is extremely long, consider segmenting it by page or logical sections.\n\n──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n2. Provide the text in the prompt along with precise instructions\n──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n• Include only the necessary text: Provide GPT with the specific text snippet (e.g., the invoice portion containing the fields you want) to limit extraneous content.\n\n• Give GPT explicit instructions on how to handle missing or uncertain data. For example:\n  – “Output a JSON with the following keys: 'invoice_number', 'CIF', 'total', 'VAT', 'invoice_date', 'due_date'. If a field is not found in the text, set its value to null (or leave it blank).”\n  – “Do not fill in values not present in the text. Do not guess.”\n\n• Set the model temperature to 0 (or near 0) when you want deterministic/lower-variance responses. This often reduces creative “hallucinations” and forces the model to be more literal in its generation.\n\n──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n3. Use a structured prompt or a “JSON schema” technique\n──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nTo reduce the chance of misformatted or “invented” fields, you can use structured prompting. For example:\n\n[INVOICE TEXT HERE]\n\n“Extract the following information from the invoice text (above). Your response MUST be valid JSON, with each key strictly as listed:\n\n{\n  \"invoice_number\": \"\",\n  \"CIF\": \"\",\n  \"total\": \"\",\n  \"VAT\": \"\",\n  \"invoice_date\": \"\",\n  \"due_date\": \"\"\n}\n\n1. If an item is not specified in the text, write null (or leave it blank). \n2. Do not add extra keys. \n3. Do not include explanations. \n4. Do not hallucinate data.”\n\nThis approach (sometimes referred to as a “JSON schema prompt”) can strongly reduce stray or unwanted responses because it effectively “forces” GPT to conform to a specific JSON structure.\n\n──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n4. Post-process and validate the output\n──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n• JSON validation: After receiving GPT’s response, parse it in your code with a JSON parser and catch any parsing exceptions or anomalies. \n• Field-by-field validation: Check each field against known patterns (e.g., a valid invoice number format, numeric checks on totals, date format checks, etc.). If any key fails to match expected patterns or is missing, consider issuing a follow-up prompt to clarify or double-check.\n\n──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n5. Employ retrieval or “tool use” techniques (more advanced scenarios)\n──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nIf you have multiple invoices or a large chunk of data, you can:\n• Use chunking: Break down the PDF text into smaller parts and have the model process them iteratively, then combine the results. \n• Use retrieval-augmented generation: Index your documents via a vector store (like FAISS or Pinecone) and retrieve only the relevant portions of text for GPT to reference. This is more involved, but can significantly reduce the chance of irrelevant/hallucinated content.\n\n──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n6. Consider specialized or domain-specific solutions\n──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nMany invoice extraction or OCR solutions are already specialized for structured data capture (e.g., Amazon Textract, Google Cloud Document AI, or other third-party APIs). While GPT-based models are flexible, specialized document AI services often come with built-in logic to parse invoice fields correctly.\n\n──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nExample Python pseudo-code using OpenAI API\n──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nBelow is a simplified example illustrating how you might combine Python’s pdfplumber and OpenAI’s API to extract structured JSON data from an invoice.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nimport json\nimport openai\nimport pdfplumber\n\n# 1. Read PDF and extract text\ndef extract_invoice_text(pdf_path):\n    # Use pdfplumber to extract text\n    text_content = []\n    with pdfplumber.open(pdf_path) as pdf:\n        for page in pdf.pages:\n            text_content.append(page.extract_text())\n    return \"\\n\".join(text_content)\n\n# 2. Prepare your prompt\ndef build_prompt(invoice_text):\n    prompt = f\"\"\"\n    The following is an invoice text:\n\n    {invoice_text}\n\n    Extract the following invoice data in valid JSON format:\n    {{\n      \"invoice_number\": \"\",\n      \"CIF\": \"\",\n      \"total\": \"\",\n      \"VAT\": \"\",\n      \"invoice_date\": \"\",\n      \"due_date\": \"\"\n    }}\n\n    Instructions:\n    1. Do not guess. Return null if the data is not explicitly stated.\n    2. Do not include additional keys.\n    3. Output must be valid JSON only, no extra commentary.\n    \"\"\"\n    return prompt\n\ndef extract_invoice_data(pdf_path, openai_api_key):\n    \"\"\"Calls the OpenAI API to get structured invoice data.\"\"\"\n    openai.api_key = openai_api_key\n    invoice_text = extract_invoice_text(pdf_path)\n    prompt = build_prompt(invoice_text)\n\n    # 3. Call the OpenAI API with temperature=0 to reduce hallucination\n    response = openai.ChatCompletion.create(\n        model=\"gpt-3.5-turbo\",\n        messages=[{\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": prompt}],\n        temperature=0,\n    )\n    \n    # Expect the model to return only JSON\n    content = response[\"choices\"][0][\"message\"][\"content\"]\n\n    # 4. Validate JSON (handle errors if JSON is invalid)\n    try:\n        invoice_data = json.loads(content)\n    except json.JSONDecodeError:\n        # If the output is not valid JSON, you can attempt re-prompt or fallback\n        invoice_data = {\"error\": \"Invalid JSON returned by the model.\"}\n    \n    return invoice_data\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    pdf_path = \"path/to/your/invoice.pdf\"\n    openai_api_key = \"YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY\"\n    result = extract_invoice_data(pdf_path, openai_api_key)\n    print(result)\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nIn practice:\n• Subdivide or chunk very long invoices (if they exceed token limits).\n• Add more constraints to the “system” or “user” messages if the model misbehaves (for example, further repeating “Do not guess or hallucinate”).\n• Always validate and sanitize results because GPT can still produce mistakes.\n\n──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nSummary\n──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n1. Convert your PDF to text carefully (OCR if necessary).  \n2. Provide only relevant/necessary text plus precise instructions (structure, valid JSON, don’t guess).  \n3. Use JSON schema-style prompts and set temperature=0 (or low) to reduce hallucinations.  \n4. Validate your output in code.  \n5. If GPT-based extraction still struggles, consider specialized invoice-parsing APIs or a hybrid approach.  \n\nWith these best practices, you can better control GPT’s output to reliably extract structured JSON, reducing both format errors and “hallucinated” invoice data.",

          "response": "It sounds like you’re running into an issue where ChatGPT sometimes adds extra text or keys that you don’t want when you ask it to extract data from an invoice PDF. This can happen because the model is tuned to be conversational and explanatory—even if your prompt asks for only a JSON output, its “creativity” and attempts to be helpful can slip in extra commentary or data. Here are a few strategies that might help:\n\n1. Be extremely explicit in your prompt. For example, include instructions like:\n  • “Extract only the following keys: invoice_number, CIF, total, date, VAT.”\n  • “Your output must be in valid JSON format and contain no extra text, explanations, or keys.”\n  • “If a key is not found, return its value as null.”\n  A sample prompt might read:  \n    \"Extract data from the text of this invoice. Return a JSON object containing exactly the keys: 'invoice_number', 'CIF', 'total', 'date', and 'VAT'. Do not include any additional information, explanations, or formatting. The response must be valid JSON and nothing else.\" \n\n2. Use delimiters or a “wrapper” instruction. You can ask the model to output the JSON within a code block (e.g., using triple backticks with \"json\") so that extra text is less likely to be produced around it. For example:  \n  \"Please provide the output wrapped in ```json``` ... Make sure your response is nothing but the JSON code block.\"\n\n3. Consider using OpenAI’s Function Calling feature (if available in your API version). When you define a function with a specified JSON schema, the API will format the model’s output to match that schema exactly. That way, you can be sure no extra data is returned.\n\n4. Post-process the output. If you are receiving extra commentary along with the JSON, you might add a layer in your code that extracts just the JSON (for example, by looking for the first { and last } bracket or using a JSON parser that can detect and ignore extraneous text). This can serve as a fallback if the prompt isn’t 100% obeyed.\n\n5. Experiment with prompt phrasing. Sometimes the way you ask for the data can make a big difference. For instance, you might try:\n  \"Below is the text from a PDF invoice. Your task is to extract the following fields and return only a valid JSON (and nothing else) with the keys 'invoice_number', 'CIF', 'total', 'date', 'VAT'. If any field is missing, set its value to null.\"  \nChanging the wording slightly or adding an example of correct JSON output in your prompt can guide the model further.\n\nUsing one or a combination of these approaches should help you get closer to the strictly formatted JSON output you need. If you continue to see extra data or keys, testing with the function calling method is highly recommended since it enforces the schema at the API level.",

The issue you're facing is that when you upload a real PDF invoice and ask ChatGPT to extract the data as JSON, the response contains data that doesn't match the specific keys you're requesting, such as invoice number, CIF, total, dates, VAT, etc.\n\nThis is a common challenge when working with unstructured data like PDF invoices. ChatGPT and other language models are not specifically designed for extracting structured data from documents. They are more focused on understanding and generating natural language.\n\nTo address this problem, you have a few options:\n\n1. **Use a dedicated PDF extraction tool**: There are specialized tools and services that are designed for extracting structured data from PDF documents. Examples include Tabula, Camelot, or commercial services like Rossum or Docparser. These tools are better equipped to handle the complexities of PDF layouts and extract the specific data you need.\n\n2. **Combine ChatGPT with other tools**: You can use ChatGPT to help with the overall process, but then leverage other tools for the actual data extraction. For example, you could use ChatGPT to understand the general structure and layout of the invoice, and then use a tool like Tabula to extract the specific data fields you need.\n\n3. **Train a custom model**: If you have a large enough dataset of invoices, you could consider training a custom machine learning model specifically for invoice data extraction. This would involve collecting a labeled dataset of invoices and their corresponding structured data, and then training a model to recognize and extract the relevant fields. Tools like Hugging Face Transformers or spaCy can be helpful for this approach.\n\n4. **Use a pre-built invoice extraction API**: There are some services that provide pre-built APIs for invoice data extraction, such as Ocrolus or Rossum. These services have already developed the necessary models and infrastructure to handle invoice processing, and you can integrate their APIs into your application.\n\nThe best approach will depend on your specific requirements, the complexity of the invoices you're dealing with, and the resources you have available. It's often a good idea to start with a simpler solution like a dedicated PDF extraction tool, and then explore more advanced options if needed.",

This is a common problem when using AI for document processing. Here are some strategies to improve accuracy:\n\n## 1. **Improve Your Prompt Structure**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"role\": \"system\",\n  \"content\": \"You are a precise data extraction assistant. Extract ONLY the information that is explicitly visible in the document. If a field is not present or unclear, use null or 'NOT_FOUND'.\"\n}\n```\n\n```json\n{\n  \"role\": \"user\", \n  \"content\": \"Extract the following data from this invoice PDF. Return ONLY valid JSON with these exact keys. If any information is not clearly visible, use null:\\n\\n{\\n  \\\"invoice_number\\\": null,\\n  \\\"cif\\\": null,\\n  \\\"total_amount\\\": null,\\n  \\\"invoice_date\\\": null,\\n  \\\"due_date\\\": null,\\n  \\\"vat_amount\\\": null,\\n  \\\"subtotal\\\": null,\\n  \\\"currency\\\": null\\n}\\n\\nIMPORTANT: Do not guess or infer values. Extract only what you can clearly see.\"\n}\n```\n\n## 2. **Add Validation Instructions**\n\n```text\nSTRICT RULES:\n- Only extract data that is explicitly written in the document\n- Use exact formatting as shown (dates as YYYY-MM-DD)\n- For amounts, include only numbers (no currency symbols)\n- If text is unclear or ambiguous, use null\n- Double-check each field before responding\n```\n\n## 3. **Request Confidence Levels**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"invoice_number\": \"INV-2024-001\",\n  \"confidence\": \"high\",\n  \"cif\": null,\n  \"confidence\": \"not_found\",\n  \"total_amount\": \"1250.00\",\n  \"confidence\": \"medium\"\n}\n```\n\n## 4. **Use OCR Pre-processing**\n\nConsider using dedicated OCR tools first:\n- **Tesseract** for text extraction\n- **Adobe PDF Services API**\n- **Google Cloud Document AI**\n- **AWS Textract**\n\nThen feed the extracted text to ChatGPT instead of the PDF directly.\n\n## 5. **Implement Validation Logic**\n\n```python\ndef validate_extracted_data(data):\n    # Check if invoice number follows expected pattern\n    if data.get('invoice_number') and not re.match(r'^[A-Z0-9-]+$', data['invoice_number']):\n        data['invoice_number'] = None\n    \n    # Validate date formats\n    if data.get('invoice_date'):\n        try:\n            datetime.strptime(data['invoice_date'], '%Y-%m-%d')\n        except ValueError:\n            data['invoice_date'] = None\n    \n    return data\n```\n\n## 6. **Multi-step Verification**\n\n```text\nStep 1: First, list all the text you can clearly read from the document\nStep 2: Then extract the requested JSON fields from that text\nStep 3: Finally, verify each field against the original text\n```\n\n## 7. **Use Specific Field Instructions**\n\n```text\n- invoice_number: Look for \"Invoice #\", \"Invoice No\", \"Factura\", etc.\n- cif: Look for \"CIF\", \"Tax ID\", \"VAT Number\" (format: letter + 8 digits)\n- total_amount: Look for \"Total\", \"Amount Due\", usually the largest number\n- dates: Format as YYYY-MM-DD, common locations: top right, header\n```\n\nWould you like me to help you craft a more specific prompt based on your particular invoice format or share the exact issues you're seeing with the extracted data?",

You’re running into a problem: when you upload a real PDF invoice and ask ChatGPT to extract the data as JSON, the response contains the data **and** some explanation or extra commentary, not just the desired JSON object.\n\n### Why This Happens\n\nChatGPT is designed to be conversational and helpful, so by default, it often adds explanations, especially if you phrase your prompt as a question or request for help. Even when you specify a format, it might prepend or append some text.\n\n### How To Get Only JSON Output\n\n**1. Use a Very Direct Prompt**\nWhen you upload the PDF (via the ChatGPT interface that supports file uploads), use a system prompt or user prompt like this:\n\n> Extract the following fields from the attached PDF invoice: invoice_number, CIF, total, dates, VAT.  \n> Return ONLY the result as a valid JSON object, with no additional text or explanation.\n\n**Example Prompt:**\n```\nExtract these fields from the attached PDF invoice:\n- invoice_number\n- CIF\n- total\n- dates\n- VAT\n\nReturn ONLY a valid JSON object, nothing else, no explanation.\n```\n\n**2. If Possible, Use Function Calling**\nOpenAI's API supports function calling in the API, which is designed to ensure the output matches a specific JSON schema. This is the most robust way to get strictly structured JSON responses, but requires coding.\n\n**Example Function Schema:**\n```json\n{\n  \"name\": \"extract_invoice_data\",\n  \"parameters\": {\n    \"invoice_number\": {\"type\": \"string\"},\n    \"CIF\": {\"type\": \"string\"},\n    \"total\": {\"type\": \"string\"},\n    \"dates\": {\"type\": \"string\"},\n    \"VAT\": {\"type\": \"string\"}\n  }\n}\n```\nYou'd then call the API with this schema and the invoice text, and get a JSON response.\n\n**3. Use Output Parsers (If Available)**\nSome interfaces (like LangChain or OpenAI Assistants) allow you to specify output parsers or force the model to respond in a specific format.\n\n---\n\n### Real-World Example (No Explanations)\n\n**Prompt:**\n```\nGiven the attached invoice PDF, extract these fields:\n- invoice_number\n- CIF\n- total\n- date\n- VAT\n\nRespond ONLY with a valid JSON object. DO NOT include any explanation or extra text.\n```\n\n**Expected Response:**\n```json\n{\n  \"invoice_number\": \"INV-12345\",\n  \"CIF\": \"B12345678\",\n  \"total\": \"1,234.56 EUR\",\n  \"date\": \"2024-03-15\",\n  \"VAT\": \"21%\"\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n### Tips\n\n- **Capitalization & Clarity:** Use “ONLY” and “DO NOT” to make your instructions clear.\n- **JSON Validation:** If you’re post-processing, use code to extract the JSON from the response, ignoring other text.\n- **API Use:** If you’re coding, use function calling or schema enforcement.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nChatGPT is likely adding extra text for clarity. To minimize this, use clear, strict prompts requesting ONLY JSON, or use API features like function calling for guaranteed structure. If you need code examples (Python/OpenAI API), just ask!",

          "response": "It sounds like you want ChatGPT (via the API or the ChatGPT web interface) to process an uploaded PDF invoice and return only a strictly formatted JSON object containing specific fields (e.g., invoice number, date, CIF, VAT, total, etc.), but you’re seeing extra/unwanted text or commentary in the response.\n\nBelow are some suggestions and best practices to help you get JSON-only responses from ChatGPT when extracting data from PDF invoices:\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n1. Preprocess the PDF into text before sending to ChatGPT\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n• While ChatGPT can handle some PDFs via plugins or third-party tools, the most reliable approach is often to extract the text from the PDF first. Use a PDF-to-text library (e.g., PyPDF2, pdfplumber, or a similar tool) to convert the invoice into raw text.  \n• Then feed that extracted text to ChatGPT with a clear instruction about which fields you need.\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n2. Give ChatGPT very explicit instructions about the format\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n• In your prompt, clarify that you want strictly valid JSON with no explanations or extra commentary.  \n• If you are calling ChatGPT via the API, consider a prompt such as:\n\n  \"\"\"\n  Below is the text from an invoice. Extract and return the following fields in valid JSON only:\n    - invoice_number\n    - cif\n    - invoice_date\n    - total_amount\n    - vat_amount\n\n  Invoice text:\n  {{INVOICE_TEXT}}\n\n  Requirements:\n  1. Provide only valid JSON—no additional text outside JSON.\n  2. Use the exact property names from the list above.\n  3. If a field is missing, return it with a null value.\n\n  Return format example:\n  {\n    \"invoice_number\": \"...\",\n    \"cif\": \"...\",\n    \"invoice_date\": \"...\",\n    \"total_amount\": \"...\",\n    \"vat_amount\": \"...\"\n  }\n\n  Please return only the JSON object and nothing else.\n  \"\"\"\n\n• By emphasizing “only JSON,” “no additional text,” and “here is the format,” you reduce the chance of extraneous commentary.\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n3. Use system messages or function calling (if available)\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n• If you’re using the OpenAI Chat Completions API, you can leverage the system role. Include something like this in the system role’s content:\n  \"You are a data extractor. You extract the specified fields from text and return them only as JSON. Do not include any commentary or reasoning.\"\n• If you have access to OpenAI function calling, you can define a function schema that enforces JSON output. This is especially powerful because it forces the model to respond in a specific JSON structure.\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n4. Use temperature and max tokens carefully\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n• When extracting structured data, set temperature=0 or a low value, which usually reduces “creative” or “hallucinated” output.  \n• Adjust max_tokens so that your response has enough room to hold the full JSON. If max_tokens is too small, the model may truncate or produce incomplete output.\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n5. Post-process the model output\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n• If ChatGPT still occasionally returns extraneous text, you can perform a post-processing step in your code. For example:\n  1. Detect the JSON substring using a regular expression or by locating the first “{” and the last “}”.\n  2. Parse that substring with a JSON library.\n  3. Discard anything outside the JSON object.  \n\n• This approach ensures that even if ChatGPT occasionally includes disclaimers or commentary, your code will extract only the JSON structure.\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n6. Check for missing or undiscoverable fields\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n• Sometimes the invoice text may not contain a value you’re looking for (e.g., “CIF” might be absent). Decide how ChatGPT should handle a missing field—return null, or an empty string, etc.  \n• Clarify that behavior in your prompt (“If you do not find a certain field, return it with a null value”).\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n7. Break your prompt into smaller steps (if needed)\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n• If your invoices are lengthy, consider first summarizing or chunking the text, then feeding it back for structured extraction.  \n• Keep your instructions concise and repeated in each step so the model consistently returns only JSON.\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nPutting it all together:\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n1. Convert invoice PDF → text (with a Python PDF library or another tool).  \n2. Call ChatGPT with a system message or a carefully structured prompt that:  \n   • Demands only JSON output.  \n   • Lists the exact keys you want.  \n   • Tells ChatGPT how to handle missing fields.  \n3. Optionally, parse the final output in your own code to ensure it’s valid JSON and discard any “stray” content.\n\nBy following these steps—especially giving clear instructions for JSON-only output and considering function-calling or system instructions—you’ll have a better chance of getting clean, structured data from ChatGPT with minimal extra commentary. If you still see extraneous text, you can safely strip it away by post-processing and parsing only the enclosed JSON substring.",

From what I can decipher, you’re using OpenAI’s API (or the ChatGPT web interface) to extract data from PDF invoices. You’re asking specifically for a JSON output with fields such as invoice number, CIF, total, dates, VAT, etc. However, when you upload a real PDF invoice and prompt ChatGPT to produce a JSON output, the response ends up containing extra data (or additional information) that isn’t strictly part of your desired JSON structure.\n\nTo address this, here are a few suggestions:\n\n1. Be very explicit in your prompt:\n  • Clearly instruct ChatGPT to output exclusively valid JSON. For example, you might say: \n   “Extract the following fields (invoice_number, CIF, total, dates, VAT, …) from the provided text and output only a JSON object. Do not include any commentary, explanation, or extra fields.”\n2. Use delimiters for your input and output:\n  • You can use markers like triple backticks for the input text and ask for the JSON output between clearly defined start and end markers. This sometimes helps the model know exactly where the JSON should begin and end.\n3. Validate and post-process the output:\n  • Sometimes even with strict instructions, the model might add extra text. Consider running the output through a JSON parser on your end to extract only the valid JSON part.\n4. Test with a simplified prompt first:\n  • Try with a sample or mock invoice data to see if the model adheres to the strict JSON-only rule before submitting a full real invoice.\n5. Format your prompt as a “role-playing” or “instructional” task:\n  • For example, “You are a data extraction tool that reads invoices and converts them into a JSON object with the following keys. Do not output anything else.”\n6. Include an example output in your prompt:\n  • Providing a clear, correct example of the expected JSON response can help guide the model to match your intended format.\n\nIt can also be helpful to first convert the PDF to plain text (using a dedicated PDF-to-text conversion tool) before sending it to ChatGPT. This ensures that the model is working with text rather than trying to interpret the PDF file structure.\n\nIf you continue to see extra data beyond the JSON object, you might consider isolating the JSON portion in your code (for example, using a regular expression or a JSON parser) so that only the valid JSON data is processed further.\n\nCould you let me know if this covers your issue or if you need more specific advice on formatting the prompt or processing the output?",

For example:\n\n> Extract the following fields from this invoice: `invoice_number`, `CIF`, `total`, `date`, `VAT`.  \n> Only respond with valid JSON, no explanations or extra text.  \n> If a field is missing, use `null` as its value.\n\nExample prompt:\n```plaintext\nExtract these fields from the invoice PDF: `invoice_number`, `CIF`, `total`, `date`, `VAT`.  \nRespond ONLY with a JSON object. If a field is missing, set its value to `null`.  \nDo not add any explanations or extra text.\n```\n\n---\n\n## 2. **File Handling**\n- **PDFs are tricky** because text extraction can fail if the PDF is a scan (image-based) or is poorly formatted.\n- If using the API, **ensure you’re extracting text** from the PDF first (using OCR if necessary, e.g., with PyPDF2, pdfplumber, or Tesseract for images).\n- Then send the extracted text (not the PDF file itself) to the model.\n\n---\n\n## 3. **Strict Output Validation**\n- Use a JSON linter to validate the response.\n- If using the API, set up a script to parse the model's output and raise an error if the JSON is invalid or fields are missing.\n\n---\n\n## 4. **Model Limitations**\n- Even with clear prompts, GPT may sometimes hallucinate data, especially if the field is not present or recognizable.\n- For sensitive or highly structured extraction, consider chaining GPT with rule-based checks or traditional parsers for validation.\n\n---\n\n## 5. **ChatGPT Web Limitations**\n- ChatGPT web version may be more prone to adding explanations or greetings.\n- If using the API, you have more control and can enforce stricter output.\n\n---\n\n## 6. **Example Workflow**\n\n1. Extract text from PDF (using a library).\n2. Send the plain text to ChatGPT with a strict prompt as above.\n3. Parse the JSON response. If it’s not valid, re-prompt or fallback to a default.\n\n---\n\n## 7. **Sample Prompt for PDF Invoice Extraction:**\n\n```plaintext\nYou are an invoice parser.\nGiven the following invoice text, extract these fields: \n- invoice_number\n- CIF\n- total\n- date\n- VAT\n\nRespond ONLY with a valid JSON object with these keys. \nIf a value is missing, use null. \nDo not add any other text or explanations.\n\nInvoice text:\n\"\"\"\n[insert extracted text from PDF here]\n\"\"\"\n```\n\n---\n\n## 8. **If Data Quality Is Still Poor**\n- Try preprocessing the extracted text (remove headers/footers, fix OCR errors).\n- Try a smaller chunk of text or highlight the specific section with the fields.\n- If possible, fine-tune a model or use OpenAI’s function calling feature (for better structured output).\n\n---\n\nIf you clarify your specific problem (e.g., “the JSON contains hallucinated fields” or “the model returns explanations and not just JSON”), I can provide more targeted advice!",

PDF documents can have complex layouts, formatting, and variations in the way information is presented, which can make it difficult for language models to consistently and accurately extract the desired data.\n\nTo address this issue, you may want to consider the following approaches:\n\n1. **Use a specialized PDF extraction tool**: There are various tools and services designed specifically for extracting data from PDF invoices, such as Tabula, Camelot, or commercial services like Rossum or Docparser. These tools are often more accurate and reliable than using a general-purpose language model like ChatGPT.\n\n2. **Train a custom model**: If you have a large enough dataset of PDF invoices, you could consider training a custom machine learning model to extract the specific data you need. This would involve annotating a dataset of invoices and fine-tuning a model like GPT-3 or a specialized document understanding model to your specific use case.\n\n3. **Combine multiple approaches**: You could use a combination of language models like ChatGPT and specialized PDF extraction tools to improve the accuracy and reliability of the data extraction. For example, you could use ChatGPT to perform initial extraction, and then use a specialized tool to validate and clean up the results.\n\n4. **Provide more context to ChatGPT**: When using ChatGPT, try to provide as much context as possible about the structure and format of the invoices you are working with. This can help the model better understand the task and extract the data more accurately.\n\nUltimately, extracting data from PDF invoices reliably and accurately is a challenging task, and may require a combination of different approaches and tools.

Only extract data that is clearly visible\n2. Do not invent or assume any values\n3. If a field is missing, use null\n4. Double-check all numbers for accuracy\n```\n\n### 3. **Use JSON Schema**\nDefine a strict schema:\n```json\n{\n  \"invoice_number\": \"string or null\",\n  \"cif\": \"string or null\",\n  \"total\": {\n    \"amount\": \"number\",\n    \"currency\": \"string\"\n  },\n  \"date\": \"YYYY-MM-DD or null\",\n  \"vat\": \"number or null\"\n}\n```\n\n### 4. **API-Specific Solutions**\n\nFor the API, consider using:\n- **Function calling** to enforce structured output\n- **JSON mode** with response_format\n- Lower temperature (0.1-0.3) for more deterministic results\n\n### 5. **Validation Layer**\nAdd a verification step:\n```\nAfter extraction, verify:\n1. All extracted values match exactly what's in the document\n2. No fields contain fabricated data\n3. Numeric values are accurate\n```\n\nWould you like me to help you craft a specific prompt template or show you how to implement function calling for more reliable extraction?",

Use a strict “system” or “assistant” instruction (API or ChatGPT web)\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nIn the OpenAI/ChatGPT interface (or your API call), you can add a system message along these lines:\n\nSYSTEM MESSAGE:\n\"You are a data-extraction assistant. Your job is to extract specific fields from a PDF invoice. You must respond ONLY with valid JSON, using these keys:  \n• invoice_number  \n• CIF  \n• total  \n• dates  \n• VAT  \n\nDo not add any extra text or explanations. If the data does not exist, return null or an empty string for that key.\"\n\nBy placing this instruction in the system or assistant role, you tell ChatGPT that your highest-priority requirement is to provide strictly those keys, in valid JSON, with no additional commentary.  \n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n2. Give ChatGPT only the trusted text from the PDF\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nIf possible, extract the actual text contents from the PDF first (e.g., via OCR or a PDF parsing library) and provide only that text to ChatGPT. Large or complex PDFs often lead ChatGPT to guess at information if the prompt is incomplete. By feeding it exactly the textual content, you reduce the chances of hallucination.\n\nIf your PDF text is large, you can segment it (e.g., by pages or relevant sections) and prompt ChatGPT in smaller chunks, each time asking for structured JSON data. Then you can merge the JSON outputs as needed.\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n3. Reduce temperature or use “strict style”\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nWhen calling the OpenAI API programmatically:\n• Set temperature to 0 or very close to 0. This signals ChatGPT to be as deterministic and “factual” as possible—less likely to invent extraneous details.  \n• Consider using “top_p=1” and “presence_penalty=0” (or minimal) to reduce creativity.\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n4. Use function calling (if you have access to it)\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nIf you are using the newer ChatGPT or OpenAI models that support function calling, you can define a function with the expected schema. For example, define a function called “extract_invoice_data” that requires exactly the following properties:\n\n{\n  \"type\": \"object\",\n  \"properties\": {\n    \"invoice_number\": { \"type\": \"string\" },\n    \"CIF\": { \"type\": \"string\" },\n    \"total\": { \"type\": \"string\" },\n    \"dates\": { \"type\": \"string\" },\n    \"VAT\": { \"type\": \"string\" }\n  },\n  \"required\": [\"invoice_number\", \"CIF\", \"total\", \"dates\", \"VAT\"]\n}\n\nWhen you instruct the model to call this function, the GPT output will be forced into the schema you define—dramatically reducing extraneous chatter.\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n5. Validate the JSON afterward\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nIf ChatGPT still includes disclaimers or extra text, you can parse the ChatGPT response as JSON. If parsing fails, you can:\n• Trim out non‐JSON text automatically (if feasible).  \n• Re‐prompt ChatGPT with a request like “Return valid JSON only, with no extra text.”  \n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nExample prompt structure (API or ChatGPT web)\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nSYSTEM:\n\"You are a data extraction system. Respond ONLY in JSON with the keys: invoice_number, CIF, total, dates, VAT. Nothing else.\"\n\nUSER:\n\"Here is the text from the invoice:\n\n--- BEGIN INVOICE TEXT ---\n[Paste only the textual data of your PDF here]\n--- END INVOICE TEXT ---\n\nPlease parse the above data and respond in JSON only.\"\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nSummary\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n• Decode the PDF content yourself and feed only the essential text to ChatGPT.  \n• Provide strict role instructions (System/Assistant) or use function calling to force JSON compliance.  \n• Set temperature low to reduce “hallucinations.”  \n• Validate or post-process the JSON at your end.\n\nUsing these approaches, you should be able to minimize extra commentary or invented data—and get ChatGPT to produce the concise JSON output you want.

I'd be happy to help you with your PDF invoice data extraction issue using OpenAI's API and ChatGPT.\n\nIt sounds like you're experiencing problems with the JSON output containing incorrect or hallucinated data when extracting information from PDF invoices. This is a common challenge when working with document extraction. Here are some strategies to improve accuracy:\n\n## Prompt Engineering Solutions:\n\n1. **Be more specific in your instructions:**\n```\nExtract ONLY the following data from this invoice. If a field is not found, use null:\n- invoice_number\n- cif\n- total_amount\n- invoice_date\n- vat_amount\nDo not infer or guess any values.\n```\n\n2. **Add validation instructions:**\n```\nBefore providing the JSON, verify each extracted value appears exactly in the document. If uncertain about any value, mark it as null rather than guessing.\n```\n\n3. **Request confidence indicators:**\n```json\n{\n  \"invoice_number\": {\"value\": \"INV-001\", \"confidence\": \"high\"},\n  \"total\": {\"value\": \"100.50\", \"confidence\": \"medium\"}\n}\n```\n\n## Technical Recommendations:\n\n- Use GPT-4 Vision for better PDF processing\n- Consider preprocessing PDFs to plain text first\n- Implement post-processing validation\n- Use temperature=0 for more consistent outputs\n- Add examples of correct extractions in your prompt\n\nWould you like me to help you craft a more specific prompt or discuss any particular aspect of the extraction process?",

Use a Clear, Structured Prompt\n\n```python\nprompt = \"\"\"\nExtract the following information from this invoice and return ONLY valid JSON:\n{\n  \"invoice_number\": \"exact invoice number as shown\",\n  \"company_cif\": \"company tax ID\",\n  \"total_amount\": \"total amount as number\",\n  \"invoice_date\": \"date in YYYY-MM-DD format\",\n  \"vat_amount\": \"VAT amount as number\",\n  \"subtotal\": \"subtotal before tax\"\n}\n\nIf a field is not found, use null. Do not invent or guess values.\n\"\"\"\n```\n\n## 2. Use System Messages for Better Control\n\n```python\nsystem_message = \"You are a precise data extraction assistant. Extract only the exact information visible in the document. Never invent or assume data. If information is not clearly visible, return null for that field.\"\n```\n\n## 3. Consider Using Function Calling\n\nOpenAI's function calling feature can help ensure consistent JSON output:\n\n```python\nfunctions = [{\n    \"name\": \"extract_invoice_data\",\n    \"parameters\": {\n        \"type\": \"object\",\n        \"properties\": {\n            \"invoice_number\": {\"type\": \"string\"},\n            \"company_cif\": {\"type\": \"string\"},\n            \"total_amount\": {\"type\": \"number\"},\n            # ... other fields\n        },\n        \"required\": [\"invoice_number\"]\n    }\n}]\n```\n\nWould you like me to provide a complete example implementation or help troubleshoot a specific issue you're encountering?",

From what you’ve shared, you’re having trouble with ChatGPT’s extraction accuracy for invoice data—sometimes the JSON output includes data that doesn’t belong or is incorrect.\n\nHere are some common reasons and suggestions to improve results:\n\n**1. PDF Text Extraction Issues:**  \nIf you’re uploading scanned PDFs or PDFs with complex formatting, the text extraction might be inaccurate even before ChatGPT processes it.  \n**Solution:**  \n- Pre-process the PDF with a reliable OCR tool (like Tesseract, Adobe, or pdfplumber for text-based PDFs).\n- Check the extracted text yourself before sending it to the API.\n\n**2. Prompt Clarity:**  \nChatGPT may hallucinate or guess information if the prompt isn’t specific, or if data is missing in the input.  \n**Solution:**  \n- Instruct ChatGPT to only extract what’s present and return null or empty strings for missing fields.\n- Example prompt:  \n  ```\n  Extract the following fields from the text below. If any field is missing, return null for that key. Only reply with a JSON object with these keys: invoice_number, CIF, total, date, VAT, etc.\n  [Paste extracted text here]\n  ```\n\n**3. Model Limitations:**  \nEven with good prompts, ChatGPT may misinterpret context or formatting, especially with tabular data.\n\n**4. Validation:**  \nAlways validate the output programmatically. If you expect, for example, a date in a certain format, check this after receiving the JSON.\n\n**5. Fine-tuning or Function Calling:**  \nIf you have access to function calling, you can define a strict schema for the model to follow, reducing errors.\n\n**6. Sample Prompt for Better Extraction:**  \n```\nGiven the following invoice text, extract these fields: invoice_number, CIF, total, date, VAT. If a field is missing, set its value to null. Only output a JSON object with these keys.\n\n[PASTE EXTRACTED TEXT HERE]\n```\n\n**If you provide a sample invoice (with confidential info removed) and your current prompt, I can help refine it for better accuracy!**",

          "response": "Hello! It sounds like you’re encountering a common issue when using ChatGPT (or the OpenAI API) to extract structured data from documents. Specifically, ChatGPT is “hallucinating” or inventing extra information that doesn’t actually appear in the invoice.\n\nBelow are some points and best practices you can try to minimize or eliminate this behavior:\n\n1) Provide the PDF’s text content directly  \n   • ChatGPT processes textual information. It doesn’t inherently have a “vision” capability for PDFs (unless you’re using a specifically enabled model with document or image understanding).  \n   • Use a PDF-to-text library (e.g., PyPDF2, pdfminer, or similar) to extract the invoice text first. Then feed that raw text into the prompt.  \n   • When you include the invoice text, clarify (in your system or user instructions) that ChatGPT should only rely on the text provided, not on assumptions.\n\n2) Use a strict instruction format  \n   • Consistently remind ChatGPT not to fabricate fields or invent data.  \n   • Example: “You are given the extracted text from an invoice. You must respond in valid JSON, using only the data that exists in the text. Do not add or guess any fields or values that are missing. If the value is not present, output an empty string or null.”  \n   • Repetition of these constraints helps ChatGPT stay aligned with your requirements.\n\n3) Specify a JSON schema or structure explicitly  \n   • Outline the JSON structure you want upfront. Example:  \n       {\n         \"invoice_number\": \"\",\n         \"CIF\": \"\",\n         \"date\": \"\",\n         \"due_date\": \"\",\n         \"VAT\": \"\",\n         \"total\": \"\"\n       }  \n   • In the same prompt, clarify that any missing data should be left blank or null. This way, ChatGPT knows exactly what to populate.\n\n4) Use temperature and other parameters to reduce creativity  \n   • If you’re using the OpenAI API, set “temperature” to 0 or close to 0. This will reduce creative text generation and push ChatGPT to more literal or “fact-based” responses.  \n   • You can also set higher “frequency penalty” or “presence penalty” to reduce repetitive or invented content.\n\n5) Double-check prompt formatting in the API  \n   • Provide a “system” or “assistant” role instruction (depending on the API version) that states exactly how ChatGPT should respond. Example:\n     System role instruction:  \n     “You are an assistant that extracts data from texts. Only provide valid JSON as the final answer. Do not include any additional commentary.”  \n   • Then, in your “user” prompt, include:  \n       1) The extracted text from the invoice.  \n       2) The instruction to extract fields and produce the JSON response.\n\n6) Consider a “chain-of-thought” suppression or a short answer approach  \n   • By default, ChatGPT might try to reason “out loud.” You can instruct it to “not show your work,” only delivering the JSON output.  \n   • This can reduce the chance of extra text slipping into the final response.\n\n7) Look into function calling (if on GPT-4 or GPT-3.5 with function calling)  \n   • With function calling, you can define a strict function schema for your JSON output. ChatGPT will fill these fields with the extracted information. This helps ensure the output follows a strict structure and often reduces hallucinations.\n\nPutting it all together, here is an example of how your prompt might look if you are using the OpenAI API (pseudo-code):\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nsystem_prompt = \"\"\"\nYou are an assistant that extracts specific fields from invoices.\nYou must do the following:\n1) You will receive text from an invoice.\n2) You must return only valid JSON, with the keys:\n   - invoice_number\n   - CIF\n   - date\n   - due_date\n   - VAT\n   - total\n3) If a field is not found in the text, use null or an empty string.\n4) Do not add any extra keys or values.\n\"\"\"\n\nuser_prompt = \"\"\"\nHere is the text of the invoice:\n\n<PASTE THE INVOICE TEXT HERE>\n\nPlease extract the requested data and return only valid JSON:\n{\n  \"invoice_number\": \"\",\n  \"CIF\": \"\",\n  \"date\": \"\",\n  \"due_date\": \"\",\n  \"VAT\": \"\",\n  \"total\": \"\"\n}\n\"\"\"\n\nresponse = openai.ChatCompletion.create(\n   model=\"gpt-3.5-turbo\",\n   temperature=0,\n   messages=[\n       {\"role\": \"system\", \"content\": system_prompt},\n       {\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": user_prompt}\n   ]\n)\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n• The system prompt strongly guides the model on the “role” you want it to play.  \n• The user prompt includes the invoice text and the final JSON structure.  \n• Setting temperature=0 is important to minimize invented content.\n\nBy following these steps, you should see fewer hallucinations and more accurate, JSON-structured responses.\n\nI hope this helps you troubleshoot and refine your invoice data extraction!

Example-Driven Prompts: Include an example of the desired input and the exact output format you expect. This can help guide the model to produce a strictly formatted response.\n\n3. Temperature and Other Parameters: If you're using the API, consider adjusting model parameters (like temperature) so the output is more deterministic. A lower temperature can help reduce extra text.\n\n4. Post-Processing: Even with careful prompting, sometimes extra text might slip through. You may consider post-processing the output (for instance, using a JSON parser) to ensure that only valid JSON is passed on for further analysis.\n\n5. Specialized Extraction Tools: Since PDF extraction can be tricky (with formatting, OCR issues, etc.), consider using specialized PDF parsing libraries (such as PyMuPDF, PDFPlumber, or Tesseract OCR for scanned documents) to extract raw text, and then feed that text to ChatGPT for further JSON extraction.\n\nLet me know if you need further help with refining your prompt or any other aspect of this workflow!",

However, the model’s response sometimes contains:**\n\n- Data that doesn’t exist in the PDF (hallucinated content)\n- Missing or incorrect fields/values\n\nLet’s address why this happens and how to improve extraction accuracy:\n\n---\n\n## Why does this happen?\n1. **Language Models Can Hallucinate:**  \n   LLMs like GPT can sometimes fabricate plausible-sounding data, especially if a requested field is missing or unclear in the input.\n2. **PDF Text Extraction Issues:**  \n   PDFs don’t always extract cleanly—text might be jumbled, missing, or formatted in a way that’s hard for the model to parse.\n3. **Prompt Ambiguity:**  \n   If your prompt isn’t explicit about what to do when data is missing, the model may invent or guess.\n\n---\n\n## How to Improve Results\n\n### 1. Use Clear, Explicit Prompts\nTell the model exactly what you want. For example:\n\n> Extract the following fields from the provided invoice text. If a field is missing, write `null` as its value. Only output valid JSON with these keys: `invoice_number`, `CIF`, `total`, `date`, `VAT`.\n\n### 2. Pre-process the PDF\n- Use PDF parsing libraries (like PyPDF2, pdfplumber, or Adobe PDF Extract API) to convert your PDF to plain text before sending it to the model.\n- Review and clean the extracted text for artifacts.\n\n### 3. Use Function Calling (API Only)\nIf you’re using the OpenAI API, leverage the function-calling feature:\n- Define a function schema with required keys.\n- The model will only output a JSON object matching your schema.\n- This reduces hallucinations and increases reliability.\n\nExample function schema (Python pseudocode):\n```python\n{\n  \"type\": \"object\",\n  \"properties\": {\n    \"invoice_number\": {\"type\": \"string\"},\n    \"CIF\": {\"type\": \"string\"},\n    \"total\": {\"type\": \"number\"},\n    \"date\": {\"type\": \"string\", \"format\": \"date\"},\n    \"VAT\": {\"type\": \"number\"}\n  },\n  \"required\": [\"invoice_number\", \"CIF\", \"total\", \"date\", \"VAT\"]\n}\n```\n\n### 4. Post-process and Validate\n- After receiving the model’s response, validate the output:\n  - Check for missing or implausible values.\n  - Cross-check against the raw extracted text.\n- If needed, prompt the model to extract again, or flag the invoice for manual review.\n\n---\n\n## Sample Prompt (for ChatGPT or API)\n```\nHere is the text extracted from a PDF invoice:\n\n[PASTE EXTRACTED TEXT HERE]\n\nExtract the following fields as a valid JSON object:\n- invoice_number\n- CIF\n- total\n- date\n- VAT\n\nIf a field is missing in the text, use null as the value. Do not guess or invent data. Only output the JSON.\n```\n\n---\n\n## Summary Table\n\n| Step                 | What to Do                                | Benefit                     |\n|----------------------|-------------------------------------------|-----------------------------|\n| Pre-process PDF      | Extract/clean PDF text                    | Reduces noise/artifacts     |\n| Use explicit prompt  | Instruct model not to guess, only JSON    | Fewer hallucinations        |\n| Use function calling | Define strict JSON schema (API only)      | Enforces structure          |\n| Post-process output  | Validate/cross-check model's output       | Catches errors/omissions    |\n\n---\n\n### If You Need an Example Workflow (Python):\n\n1.

          "response": "Below is a concise, step-by-step guide to help ensure you get pure JSON output—without extra text—from ChatGPT or the OpenAI API when extracting data from PDF invoices.\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n1. Pre-processing the PDF (Text Extraction)\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nChatGPT cannot read raw PDFs in their binary form by default. You first need to extract text from the PDF using a tool such as:\n• Python libraries (pdfplumber, PyPDF2)  \n• OCR tools (Tesseract) if the PDF is a scanned image  \n• Any third-party text-extraction service  \n\nOnce you have the extracted text, you can feed that text into ChatGPT or the OpenAI API.\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n2. Use a “System” or “Role” Instruction (OpenAI API)\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n• If you are using the ChatGPT API (the GPT-3.5 or GPT-4 “chat” endpoints), provide a system message that clearly instructs the model to:\n  – Respond with JSON only  \n  – Avoid any additional commentary, disclaimers, or conversational text  \n\nExample system message:\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n{\n  \"role\": \"system\",\n  \"content\": \"You are an information extraction assistant. Your goal is to extract specific fields from the provided invoice text and return only JSON. Do not include explanations, disclaimers, or extra text. Respond with valid JSON only.\"\n}\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n3. Provide a Clear User Prompt with Desired JSON Format\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n• In the user message, include:\n  – The text extracted from the PDF (or a snippet).  \n  – A concise instruction on which fields you want extracted.  \n  – A sample JSON structure, so the model understands exactly how the output should look.\n\nExample user message:\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n{\n  \"role\": \"user\",\n  \"content\": \"Extract the following fields from the invoice text: \n- invoice_number (string)\n- cif (string)\n- total (number or string)\n- issue_date (string)\n- vat (number or string)\n\nThe invoice text is:\n'Acme Corp\nInvoice Number: 12345\nCIF: A12345678\nTotal: 345.67 EUR\nDate: 2023-09-01\nVAT: 21%'\n\nIMPORTANT: Return ONLY a JSON object with the keys: invoice_number, cif, total, issue_date, vat. Do not add any other text.\"\n\n}\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n4. Enforce the JSON-Only Format in Your Prompting\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n• If the model still returns disclaimers or additional text, refine your system or user prompt. For example, add a final warning like:  \n  “Do not include extra text. Do not include any other keys. Failure to respond with exclusively valid JSON will be considered non-compliant.”\n\n• You can also instruct the model that the format must be strictly valid JSON. If it attempts to provide any text outside of JSON, re-prompt or parse the response programmatically to discard any extraneous content.\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n5. Example of a Correct Response\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nA perfect response from the model (if you are using the exact text above) would be:\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n{\n  \"invoice_number\": \"12345\",\n  \"cif\": \"A12345678\",\n  \"total\": \"345.67\",\n  \"issue_date\": \"2023-09-01\",\n  \"vat\": \"21%\"\n}\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n6. Tips for the OpenAI ChatGPT Web Interface\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n• You can still use a similar approach in the ChatGPT web UI:\n  – At the very beginning, paste a “system-style” instruction (e.g., “You are a data extraction tool. Return only JSON.”).  \n  – Follow it immediately with your user prompt containing the text from the invoice and the exact JSON keys you need.  \n• If ChatGPT includes extra commentary, click “Regenerate response” and tighten your instructions. ChatGPT’s behavior can be iterative.  \n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n7. Programmatic Techniques (If Using the OpenAI API)\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n• After getting the ChatGPT response, always validate the string to confirm it is valid JSON (for example, using a try/except block in Python with json.loads).\n• If the response is not valid JSON or includes extra text, you can automatically re-prompt:\n  – Provide the entire invalid response back to ChatGPT in a user role saying: “You added extra text to the JSON. Please return only valid JSON. Here is your previous answer: [RESPONSE]. Rewrite it as valid JSON only.”\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n8. Troubleshooting\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n• If ChatGPT consistently adds disclaimers, it may be due to certain policy triggers in your prompt. Try simplifying or clarifying your request.  \n• Make sure your prompt does not contain leading or trailing instructions that might cause ChatGPT to add disclaimers.  \n• Break down the PDF text if it is too large (exceeding token limits).  \n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nSummary\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n1. Convert your PDF to text first.  \n2. Use a strict system message: “Return only JSON.”  \n3. Provide a clear user prompt with your desired JSON structure.  \n4. Validate JSON on your end and re-prompt if the model adds extra text.  \n5. If you still get disclaimers, further tighten your instructions and system messages.  \n\nBy using these best practices—especially leveraging the system role and explicit instructions to output JSON only—you will greatly reduce or eliminate unwanted extra text in ChatGPT’s responses.",

          "response": "It sounds like the issue is that when you request a JSON output, ChatGPT sometimes includes extra text or formatting (for instance, markdown formatting) along with your requested JSON keys. Here are a few suggestions to get closer to your goal of receiving only the JSON output:\n\n1. Be very explicit in your prompt. For example, say something like:  \n   \"Please extract the data from the attached PDF invoice and return ONLY a JSON object with the following keys: invoice_number, CIF, total, date, VAT, etc. Do not include any additional text, explanations, or markdown formatting—only the pure JSON output.\"\n\n2. If you’re using ChatGPT via the API, consider using a system message (or higher-level instructions) that sets the expectation for JSON-only outputs. For example, in your system prompt you could include:  \n   \"When processing input, if the output is required in JSON format, respond only in valid JSON with no surrounding commentary, markdown, or explanation.\"\n\n3. If ChatGPT still returns extra data or formatting, you might need to follow up with a clarifying message like, \"Please remove any text that isn't part of the JSON object.\" Sometimes a follow-up prompt like this nudges ChatGPT into cleaner output.\n\n4. Ensure that your list of keys is unambiguous. For example, if you need \"date,\" clarify if you need invoice_date, due_date, etc. The clearer your key specifications, the less room there is for extra output or misinterpretation.\n\n5. Consider post-processing the response on your end. If you’re using the API, you might use a JSON parser that validates the output and strips out any stray text. This can act as a safeguard if ChatGPT deviates from the strict JSON requirement.\n\nBy combining explicit prompt instructions with robust post-processing or API logic, you should be able to reliably extract a JSON object with only the desired keys.

If a field is missing, output null. Output ONLY valid JSON, no explanations.”\n- **Example Prompt:**  \n  ```\n  Extract the following fields from this invoice as a JSON object: \n  - invoice_number\n  - cif\n  - total\n  - date\n  - vat\n\n  If a field is not present, use null. Output ONLY valid JSON, no extra text.\n  ```\n- **Sample Output:**  \n  ```json\n  {\n    \"invoice_number\": \"INV12345\",\n    \"cif\": \"B12345678\",\n    \"total\": 1200.50,\n    \"date\": \"2024-05-22\",\n    \"vat\": 21\n  }\n  ```\n\n#### 2. **Preprocess the PDF**\n- **Text Extraction:**  \n  Use robust PDF-to-text tools (e.g., pdfplumber, PyMuPDF, or Adobe PDF API) to extract the invoice text as cleanly as possible before sending it to the model.\n- **OCR Quality:**  \n  For scanned invoices, use high-quality OCR (e.g. Tesseract, Google Vision API) to minimize errors.\n\n#### 3. **Model Version**\n- **Use GPT-4 or newer:**  \n  These models are generally better at following instructions and parsing documents.\n\n#### 4. **Post-processing**\n- **JSON Validation:**  \n  Always validate the output JSON in your code. If there’s an error, you can re-prompt or fix minor issues automatically.\n- **Field Verification:**  \n  Cross-check extracted values (e.g., does “CIF” follow the expected pattern? Is the total a number?)\n\n#### 5. **Chunking for Large Invoices**\n- If the invoice is too long, split it into sections and process separately.\n\n---\n\n### Example: Improved Prompt\n\n```text\nBelow is the text content of a PDF invoice. Extract ONLY the following fields as a JSON object:\n- invoice_number\n- cif\n- total\n- date\n- vat\n\nIf a field is not present in the text, set its value to null. Output STRICTLY valid JSON. Do not explain or add extra text.\n\n[INVOICE TEXT GOES HERE]\n```\n\n---\n\n### Troubleshooting\n\n- **Hallucinations persist:**  \n  Try adding: “Do not invent or guess values. Only use information explicitly found in the invoice text.”\n- **Inconsistent formats:**  \n  Specify the format for each field (e.g., dates as YYYY-MM-DD, amounts as numbers).\n\n---\n\n### Summary\n\n- Use precise prompts that forbid guessing or explanations.\n- Preprocess PDF text carefully.\n- Use post-processing to validate and clean up results.\n- If possible, fine-tune a model for your specific document type for even better accuracy.\n\nIf you share a sample input and the output you’re getting, I can help you refine your prompt further!",

That might help pinpoint what’s causing the divergence.\n\nIn the meantime, here are a few suggestions that might help ensure a stricter JSON output:\n\n1. Be Explicit in Your Prompt:\n   • Clearly specify that the output must be valid JSON and include only the keys you’ve mentioned (e.g., invoice_number, CIF, total, dates, VAT).\n   • For example, you could write: \n     \"Extract the following information from the uploaded invoice and output ONLY in JSON (no additional text), following this format:\n      {\n          'invoice_number': <value>,\n          'CIF': <value>,\n          'total': <value>,\n          'date': <value>,\n          'VAT': <value>\n      } \n      Do not include any explanation or extra keys.\"\n\n2. Leverage Few-shot Examples:\n   • Provide an example of an invoice snippet and the exact desired JSON, so the model understands the formatting rules.\n\n3. Use Function Calling (if available):\n   • OpenAI’s API now supports function calling with a defined JSON schema. By specifying a strict JSON schema, the API can enforce output that adheres closely to your expected format.\n   • For example, define a function with the parameters and types that exactly match your invoice data, so the returned data is structured exactly as you want.\n\n4. Post-Processing:\n   • While not ideal, you might run a quick validation on the output (e.g., using a JSON schema validator in your application) and extract only the keys you’re interested in.\n\nIf you can provide further details or examples from the actual responses you're getting, I’d be happy to help tailor a prompt or approach that better meets your needs.",

          "response": "I understand your concern. When using OpenAI's API or the ChatGPT web interface to extract data from PDF invoices, it's common to encounter some challenges in getting a fully accurate and complete JSON output. Here are a few things to consider:\n\n1. **PDF Structure and Quality**: The quality and structure of the PDF invoice can significantly impact the accuracy of the data extraction. Invoices with complex layouts, handwritten elements, or poor image quality can be more challenging for the language model to process accurately.\n\n2. **Specific Data Fields**: The specific data fields you're requesting, such as invoice number, CIF, total, dates, VAT, etc., may not always be present in the same location or format across different invoices. The language model may struggle to consistently identify and extract these specific fields.\n\n3. **Contextual Understanding**: Language models, while powerful, can sometimes lack the deeper contextual understanding required to accurately interpret the meaning and relationships between different data points on an invoice. This can lead to misinterpretations or incomplete extractions.\n\nTo improve the accuracy of your data extraction, you could consider the following:\n\n1. **Provide Sample Invoices**: Provide the language model with several sample invoices that represent the typical format and structure of the invoices you'll be working with. This can help the model better understand the layout and learn to identify the relevant data fields.\n\n2. **Fine-tune the Language Model**: If you have a larger dataset of invoices, you could consider fine-tuning the language model on your specific invoice data. This can help the model learn the nuances of your invoice structure and improve its ability to extract the desired information.\n\n3. **Combine with Rule-based Extraction**: Complement the language model-based extraction with rule-based techniques, such as pattern matching or template-based approaches. This can help address the limitations of the language model and improve the overall accuracy of the data extraction.\n\n4. **Implement Validation and Error Handling**: Develop a process to validate the extracted data and handle any errors or inconsistencies. This could involve cross-checking the extracted data against other sources, implementing data quality checks, and providing feedback to the language model to improve its performance over time.\n\nRemember that data extraction from complex documents like invoices is a challenging task, and no single approach may provide a perfect solution. By combining different techniques, leveraging sample data, and implementing robust validation and error handling, you can improve the accuracy and reliability of your data extraction process.",

Even when you request only a JSON output with specific keys, the response sometimes includes data that…\n\nIt seems your message was cut off, but I understand your core issue:  \n**ChatGPT sometimes returns extra data or does not strictly follow the requested JSON format when extracting information from PDF invoices.**\n\nHere are some tips to improve the accuracy and formatting of JSON responses:\n\n1. **Be Explicit in Your Prompt:**  \n   Specify:  \n   - Only output valid JSON with the following keys: [list your keys].  \n   - Do not include explanations, comments, or any extra text.\n\n   Example prompt:  \n   ```\n   Extract the following fields from this invoice: invoice_number, CIF, total, date, VAT.  \n   Respond ONLY with a valid JSON object containing ONLY these keys. Do not include any explanations or extra text.\n   ```\n\n2. **Use System Prompts (API):**  \n   If using the API, set a system message to reinforce the format, e.g.:\n   ```\n   You are an information extraction assistant. When given invoices, output ONLY a valid JSON object with these keys: invoice_number, CIF, total, date, VAT. No extra text.\n   ```\n\n3. **Add Format Examples:**  \n   Providing an example increases compliance:\n   ```\n   Output format example:\n   {\n     \"invoice_number\": \"12345\",\n     \"CIF\": \"A12345678\",\n     \"total\": \"1500.00\",\n     \"date\": \"2024-06-10\",\n     \"VAT\": \"21%\"\n   }\n   ```\n\n4. **Post-Processing (if needed):**  \n   If you’re receiving extra text, you can use code to extract the JSON object from the model's response. For example, in Python:\n   ```python\n   import re\n   import json\n\n   def extract_json(text):\n       match = re.search(r'\\{.*\\}', text, re.DOTALL)\n       if match:\n           return json.loads(match.group())\n       else:\n           return None\n   ```\n   This helps if the model occasionally adds extra explanations.\n\n5. **Model Choice:**  \n   GPT-4 models tend to be more reliable for structured outputs than GPT-3.5. If you’re using ChatGPT web, try switching to GPT-4.\n\n6. **PDF Parsing:**  \n   Ensure your PDF-to-text extraction is clean. Garbled or poorly extracted text reduces accuracy.\n\n**Summary:**  \n- Use clear, strict prompts.\n- Provide an example output.\n- Post-process responses if necessary to extract only the JSON.\n\nIf you share a full example of your prompt and the unwanted output, I can suggest even more specific improvements.",

          "response": "It sounds like the main issue is that ChatGPT is including extra text or formatting in its response rather than returning strictly the JSON object you want. Below are a few approaches to help you get consistent JSON responses:\n\n1) Provide Clear, Explicit Instructions About Format\n   • In your prompt (or system message), explicitly instruct ChatGPT to output only valid JSON—no additional text or explanations.  \n   • For example, you might say:  \n     \"Please extract the following fields from this invoice:  \n       - invoice_number  \n       - CIF  \n       - total  \n       - dates  \n       - VAT  \n     Respond only with valid JSON in the format:  \n       {\n         'invoice_number': '...',\n         'CIF': '...',\n         'total': '...',\n         'dates': '...',\n         'VAT': '...'\n       }  \n     No additional text or commentary.\"  \n   • If you’re using ChatGPT in the browser, you can still include such instructions at the start of your conversation or in each prompt.\n\n2) Include a JSON Schema or Example of the Desired Output\n   • If ChatGPT is uncertain about the JSON structure you want, it might produce extra fields or add disclaimers.  \n   • A helpful strategy is to provide a sample JSON object that exactly matches the structure you need. For instance:  \n     \"Below is a sample of the exact JSON structure you must return:  \n      {\n        'invoice_number': 'INV-0001',\n        'CIF': 'B12345678',\n        'total': 123.45,\n        'dates': {\n          'invoice_date': '2023-10-01',\n          'due_date': '2023-10-15'\n        },\n        'VAT': 21\n      }  \n      Use the same keys and format—no additional keys or text.\"\n\n3) Use the OpenAI ChatCompletion or Completions Endpoint with System and User Instructions\n   • When using the OpenAI API, you can use \"system\" and \"user\" role messages to clarify formatting constraints.  \n   • Example (in pseudo-code):  \n     messages=[\n       {\"role\": \"system\", \"content\": \"You are a data extraction tool that outputs JSON only.\"},\n       {\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"Extract from the following invoice PDF text. Return only valid JSON. No extra text. ...\"}\n     ]\n   • By setting the system message firmly, ChatGPT is more likely to adhere to the instructions.\n\n4) Post-Process the Output on Your End\n   • Even if ChatGPT occasionally adds extra text, you can perform a step in your code to detect and parse out the JSON portion. For example:\n     1. Locate the first curly brace “{” and the matching closing brace “}” in the response string.  \n     2. Extract that substring as JSON.  \n     3. Parse it using a JSON parser.  \n   • This can help guard against partial compliance or disclaimers.\n\n5) Check Whether the PDF Text Is Ambiguous or Garbled\n   • Sometimes, if the PDF text is not parsed well (for instance, if you’re using copy-paste text or with low-quality OCR), ChatGPT may guess what the values are.  \n   • Make sure the input text you feed into ChatGPT is as clean and complete as possible.  \n   • If you need higher-fidelity extraction, consider specialized OCR/Invoice-parsing pipelines before ChatGPT to minimize hallucinations.\n\n6) Consider Model Temperature and Other Parameters\n   • In the OpenAI API, setting the \"temperature\" to 0 (or a low value) makes the model less likely to generate creative text.  \n   • This can help ensure it sticks to the structure you provide.\n\n7) Iterate and Narrow Down Instructions\n   • Continue refining your prompts based on the model’s output. If it deviates from pure JSON, add clarifications or more rigorous constraints in your prompt:  \n     \"Do not include any explanation, apologies, or disclaimers. ONLY return valid JSON.\"\n\nSummary of Key Steps:\n1) Give ChatGPT a strict schema or example JSON.  \n2) Set it to only output JSON (no extra text).  \n3) Include these instructions firmly (\"system\" or top-level text).  \n4) If necessary, parse the output in your code to extract only the JSON portion.  \n\nWith these steps, you should be able to obtain a cleaner JSON response from your PDF invoice queries.",

For example, providing a template with the expected keys:  \n  {\n   \"invoice_number\": \"\",\n   \"CIF\": \"\",\n   \"total\": \"\",\n   \"invoice_date\": \"\",\n   \"VAT\": \"\"\n  }  \nInstruct the model to fill in only these values based on the invoice content.\n\n5. If you still occasionally receive extra surrounding text, you can post-process the output (with a regex or JSON parser) to extract the valid JSON substring.\n\nBy using these techniques, you should be able to minimize or eliminate the extra text and get a clean JSON output for your PDF invoice data extraction.",

Ensuring clarity and specificity in the prompt is essential. For example, explicitly instructing ChatGPT to return only the JSON format with specific keys and no additional text or explanation can significantly improve accuracy.\n\n2. **PDF Parsing Issues**: If the PDF content is complex or poorly formatted, ChatGPT might include unintended portions of text. Consider preprocessing PDFs with specialized tools (like PyMuPDF, PyPDF2, pdfplumber, or PDF-to-text extraction tools) before passing the content to ChatGPT, as the model cannot directly read PDFs without preprocessing.\n\n3. **Model Behavior**: The model sometimes provides additional explanations or context, even when instructed not to. You can implement stricter instructions or experiment with system prompts to enforce constraints, such as explicitly directing the model to provide only JSON output.\n\nRecommended Steps to Improve Results:\n\n- **Clarify and Strengthen the Prompt**:  \n  For example:\n  ```\n  \"Extract only the following data from the invoice in JSON format without any additional explanations or text:\n  {\n    \"invoice_number\": \"\",\n    \"CIF\": \"\",\n    \"invoice_date\": \"\",\n    \"due_date\": \"\",\n    \"total_amount\": \"\",\n    \"VAT_amount\": \"\",\n    \"supplier\": \"\",\n    \"customer\": \"\"\n  }\"\n  ```\n\n- **Preprocess PDF Content**:  \n  Convert the PDF to plain text first, and then feed clearly structured text into the model.\n\n- **Utilize OpenAI’s Function Calling or JSON Mode**:  \n  Newer OpenAI models and features, such as `function calling` (available via the API), allow more structured responses and enforce JSON structure strictly.\n\n- **Limit the Model’s Output**:  \n  Clearly state that no additional text or explanations should be included.\n\nIf you can share more details about your current prompt and workflow, I can provide more specific suggestions.

They rely on whatever text is extracted from the PDF. If the extraction is faulty (e.g., due to formatting, non-selectable text, or scanned images), the model may try to \"fill in the blanks\" with plausible data.\n\n2. **Model Tendency to Complete Patterns:**  \nIf the prompt asks for a specific JSON structure, the model may try to fill every field, even if the data isn’t present, to produce a complete-looking response.\n\n3. **No Explicit Instruction on Missing Data:**  \nUnless you instruct the model otherwise, it may invent values for fields it can't find, rather than leaving them blank or using null.\n\n**How to Reduce Hallucinated or Incorrect Data**\n\n- **Explicit Instructions:**  \n  In your prompt, add clear instructions such as:  \n  \"If a value is not found in the PDF, return null or leave it blank. Do not guess or invent data.\"\n\n- **Example Prompt:**\n\n  ```\n  Extract the following fields from this invoice PDF: invoice_number, CIF, total, date, VAT, etc. \n  Output only a JSON object with these keys. \n  If any value is not present in the document, set its value to null. \n  Do not guess or make up any data. Only use what is exactly present in the document.\n  ```\n\n- **Post-Processing:**  \n  If you control the API output, you can check for plausible values (e.g., regex for invoice numbers, totals, etc.) and flag or remove unlikely data.\n\n- **Use OCR for Scanned PDFs:**  \n  If invoices are scans or images, use an OCR tool (like Tesseract or AWS Textract) to convert them to text before sending to GPT.\n\n- **Sample Code for Robust Extraction:**\n\n  ```python\n  import openai\n\n  prompt = \"\"\"\n  Extract the following fields from the provided invoice text: invoice_number, CIF, total, date, VAT.\n  Output only a JSON object with these keys.\n  If a value is missing, write null.\n  Do not guess or invent values.\n  Here is the invoice text:\n  {invoice_text}\n  \"\"\"\n\n  # after extracting invoice_text with a reliable PDF-to-text library\n  response = openai.ChatCompletion.create(\n      model=\"gpt-3.5-turbo\",\n      messages=[{\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": prompt}]\n  )\n  ```\n\n**Summary Table:**\n\n| Issue                | Solution                                               |\n|----------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|\n| Hallucinated data    | Instruct \"do not guess, use null if missing\"           |\n| Scanned/image PDF    | Use OCR before extraction                              |\n| Incomplete extraction| Try different PDF-to-text tools, check extracted text  |\n\nIf you share a sample prompt and a (redacted) example invoice, I can help refine your workflow further!",

          "response": "It looks like your message got cut off, so I’m not entirely sure what the full problem statement is. However, I can share some general strategies for instructing ChatGPT to extract data from invoices (or any PDF text) in a structured JSON format without adding extraneous information:\n\n1. Provide clear, strict instructions in both the system and user messages.\n   • In the “system message,” explicitly demand JSON only—no extra text, no introduction, and no commentary.  \n   • For example:  \n     ---------------------------------------------------------------------------  \n     System message:  \n     “You are an assistant that extracts data from invoices. Output only valid JSON. Do not include any explanations. If a field does not exist, output an empty string or null. The JSON must have the following keys:  \n     {  \n       \"invoice_number\": \"\",  \n       \"CIF\": \"\",  \n       \"total_amount\": \"\",  \n       \"invoice_date\": \"\",  \n       \"due_date\": \"\",  \n       \"VAT\": \"\"  \n     }”  \n     ---------------------------------------------------------------------------  \n   • In your user request, restate clearly that the model must focus only on the text in the PDF. If a field is missing, it must return null or an empty string rather than hallucinating.\n\n2. Reinforce “don’t invent data” in your prompt.\n   • Free-form Large Language Models can sometimes generate plausible-sounding data even if it’s not in the source text.  \n   • You can mitigate this by instructing the model: “If you are not sure about a field’s value, leave it blank or null. Do not guess.”\n\n3. If possible, supply extracted text from the PDF directly—avoid letting the model “see” the entire PDF in a single chunk or in a generic context.\n   • ChatGPT might interpret text outside the relevant region and guess fields.  \n   • Instead, you can provide the raw text from the invoice portion by portion: “Here is the text from the invoice: …”  \n   • Then ask the model to parse only that text.\n\n4. Consider using function-calling (for OpenAI API users).\n   • OpenAI’s function calling feature (if you have access) allows you to describe a JSON schema or function signature, and the model will return properly formatted JSON.  \n   • By specifying the function parameters (like “invoice_number,” “CIF,” “total,” etc.) with the correct data types, the model is more likely to comply.\n\n5. Use strict regex or schema validations on your end.\n   • Once you get the JSON string back, run it through a schema validator or a JSON parser that checks for the required fields.  \n   • If the result does not match the schema (e.g., it includes extra fields or lacks required keys), you can prompt the model again or handle the discrepancy in your code.\n\n6. Test with a simpler prompt and verify.\n   • Start by giving ChatGPT a small portion of an invoice text and demanding only two or three fields in the JSON. If it works well, scale up your requests.  \n   • This helps you pinpoint where the model starts to drift and whether the instructions need further refinement.\n\n7. Re-check your model and temperature setting.\n   • A higher temperature can lead to more creative fabrications. Consider lowering the temperature to keep the responses more literal and factual.\n\n8. Include examples (sometimes helps).\n   • Provide a short “ideal answer” example, showing exactly how you expect the JSON to look, with dummy data.  \n   • Then say, “Follow exactly this format, with the fields from the invoice text only.”\n\nPutting it all together:\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nSystem prompt:\n“You are an assistant that extracts data from invoices. Always respond with valid JSON—no extra text, no explanations. If any field is missing from the invoice, output an empty string or null rather than guessing.”\n\nUser prompt:\n“Here is the raw text from the invoice:\n\n[PASTE INVOICE TEXT HERE]\n\nPlease extract and return only the following JSON keys and values:\n{\n  \"invoice_number\": \"\",\n  \"CIF\": \"\",\n  \"total_amount\": \"\",\n  \"invoice_date\": \"\",\n  \"due_date\": \"\",\n  \"VAT\": \"\"\n}\nRemember, do not add any extra commentary.”\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nIf you still see the model inventing fields that are not in your PDF, keep reinforcing the instructions (e.g., “If you can’t find a field, use an empty string. Do not hallucinate or invent any data”). Additionally, ensure you are always providing the exact invoice text that needs parsing, rather than letting ChatGPT infer from prior context.\n\nI hope that helps you get consistent, minimal, and accurate JSON outputs from ChatGPT or the OpenAI API! If you can clarify more about the specific behavior (“the response contains data that…”), feel free to share, and I can focus further on that scenario.",

          "response": "It sounds like you’re encountering an issue where ChatGPT returns extra text or data beyond the precise JSON structure you want. Here are some suggestions to help ensure that the output contains only the JSON with your required keys:\n\n1. Be very explicit in your prompt. For example, include instructions like:  \n  \"Extract data from this invoice and return exactly one JSON object containing only the following keys: invoice_number, CIF, total, dates, and VAT. Do not include any extra text, commentary, or markdown formatting—only the JSON.\"\n\n2. Validate the output format. After receiving a response, you can try parsing it as JSON. If parsing fails because of extra text, you may adjust your instructions or perform post-processing on your side.\n\n3. Consider using delimiters. Sometimes wrapping your expected output instructions in clear markers (such as \"START JSON\" and \"END JSON\") may remind the model to restrict its output. For example:  \n\n  \"Please extract the data and output only the JSON object between the markers.  \n  START JSON  \n  {  \n    \"invoice_number\": <value>,  \n    \"CIF\": <value>,  \n    \"total\": <value>,  \n    \"dates\": <value>,  \n    \"VAT\": <value>  \n  }  \n  END JSON\"  \n\n4. If possible, preprocess the PDF to extract its text before sending it to ChatGPT. Using a dedicated PDF-text extraction tool can sometimes yield cleaner input for the model, reducing ambiguities and helping the model focus on the structure you want.\n\n5. If you’re using the OpenAI API with ChatGPT, consider designing the conversation so that the system prompt or the first assistant message establishes the desired output format strictly. This might involve setting the context so that ChatGPT “knows” that only valid JSON is acceptable, and any deviation will be flagged.\n\nBy combining these strategies, you should significantly reduce the chance of receiving extra or non-JSON text in your API responses.

When you try to extract data from PDF invoices using OpenAI's API or ChatGPT web, the response you receive may not contain the specific keys you're looking for, such as invoice number, CIF, total, dates, VAT, etc.\n\nThis is a common issue when working with unstructured data like PDF invoices. The challenge is that PDF documents can have varying formats, layouts, and information, making it difficult for a language model like ChatGPT to consistently extract the exact data you need.\n\nTo address this, you might want to consider the following approaches:\n\n1. **Use a specialized PDF extraction tool**: There are various tools and services designed specifically for extracting data from PDF invoices, such as Tabula, Camelot, or Docparser. These tools are often better equipped to handle the complexities of PDF layouts and can provide more reliable and structured data outputs.\n\n2. **Provide more context to ChatGPT**: When using ChatGPT, try to provide more context about the specific invoice format you're working with, such as example invoices or a description of the key information you need. This can help the model better understand the structure of the data you're looking for.\n\n3. **Combine language models with rule-based extraction**: You could consider using a combination of language models like ChatGPT and rule-based extraction techniques. For example, you could use ChatGPT to extract the raw text from the PDF, and then apply your own custom rules or regular expressions to parse the text and extract the specific data you need.\n\n4. **Explore other AI-based PDF extraction services**: In addition to OpenAI's API, there are other AI-based services that specialize in PDF data extraction, such as Amazon Textract, Google Cloud Vision, or Microsoft Azure Form Recognizer. These services may provide more accurate and structured data outputs for your specific use case.\n\n5. **Develop a custom solution**: If you have a large volume of invoices to process or require a high level of accuracy, you may want to consider developing a custom solution. This could involve training a machine learning model on a large dataset of invoices or creating a rule-based system tailored to your specific invoice formats.\n\nThe key is to experiment with different approaches and tools to find the one that works best for your particular use case and invoice data. It may take some trial and error, but with the right strategy, you should be able to extract the specific data you need from your PDF invoices.",

Explicit Prompting**\nAsk the model to only extract data verbatim from the PDF, and to set fields as `null` or `\"\"` (empty string) if not present.  \n**Example prompt:**  \n> Extract the following fields from this invoice PDF as a JSON object: invoice number, CIF, total, dates, VAT, etc.  \n> **Important:** Only include information that is explicitly present in the document. If a field is missing, set its value to `null`. Do NOT guess or invent values.\n\n**2. Post-Processing**\nAfter extraction, cross-check fields programmatically against the original text/OCR output to flag or remove likely hallucinated values.\n\n**3. Use Preprocessing**\nIf possible, extract text from the PDF using a dedicated PDF-to-text or PDF-to-JSON tool (like pdfplumber, PyMuPDF, Tesseract for OCR) before sending to ChatGPT. Then have ChatGPT parse the extracted text, not the raw PDF.\n\n**4. Structured Extraction via API**\nUse OpenAI’s function calling (or tools like Microsoft’s Azure Form Recognizer or Google Document AI) for more reliable field extraction.\n\n**5. Feedback Loop**\nIf you see hallucinated data, correct it and reinforce in your prompt what the correct behavior is.\n\n---\n\n## Example Robust Prompt\n\nHere’s a template you can try (for ChatGPT Web or API):\n\n```\nYou are a data extraction assistant. Given the following text extracted from an invoice, return a JSON object with these fields: invoice_number, CIF, total, date, VAT, etc.  \n- Only include values that are explicitly present in the text.  \n- If a field is not present, set it to null.  \n- Do not guess or make up values.  \n- Your response should be only valid JSON, with no additional text.\n\nText:\n[Paste extracted invoice text here]\n```\n\n---\n\nIf you want to share an example PDF (or its extracted text), I can help craft a more specific extraction prompt or troubleshoot further!\n\nLet me know how you’d like to proceed.",

If you’re using the OpenAI API directly (chat completions), you have more control over system and user messages, temperature, and other parameters. This means you can exert more fine-grained control to steer the model’s behavior (for example, you can strictly enforce “JSON-only” responses).  \n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n2) Extracting Data from PDF Invoices as JSON\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n\nYou mentioned that when you upload a real PDF invoice and ask ChatGPT (or the API) to return JSON with specific keys (invoice number, CIF, total, dates, VAT, etc.), you sometimes get unwanted or extraneous text, hallucinated data, or otherwise non-JSON segments. Here are practical suggestions to mitigate these issues:\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nA) Ensure Proper Input Text Extraction from the PDF\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n• Use a reliable method to convert PDF content into text.  \n  – OCR (e.g., Tesseract, AWS Textract, Google Vision) if the PDF is primarily scanned.  \n  – A PDF parsing library (e.g., pdfplumber, PyPDF2) for digital PDFs.  \n• Trim out non-essential text (e.g., letterheads, footers) if you only need the key invoice data.  \n• Provide the raw text of interest to the model.  \n\nWhy this helps: If the model has a clearer, direct view of the text, it’s less likely to guess or hallucinate.\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nB) Use a System or “Developer” Prompt to Enforce JSON Output\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nWhen you call the API (chat completions), set up a system message like this:\n\nSYSTEM MESSAGE EXAMPLE\n----------------------\nYou are an assistant that extracts structured data from text.  \nOutput the data in valid JSON format, using these keys:  \n• invoice_number  \n• CIF  \n• total  \n• issue_date  \n• VAT  \n• etc.  \n\nOutput only valid JSON. Do not include any extra explanations.  \n\n----------------------\n\nThen, in your user message, include the text content of the invoice (or relevant excerpt). Ask ChatGPT to extract the values:\n\nUSER MESSAGE EXAMPLE\n--------------------\nHere is the invoice text:\n[Insert extracted text here]\n\nPlease provide a JSON object with the following fields:  \n{\n  \"invoice_number\": \"...\",\n  \"CIF\": \"...\",\n  \"total\": \"...\",\n  \"issue_date\": \"...\",\n  \"VAT\": \"...\",\n  ...\n}\n\nDo not include any extra text or explanation.\n----------------------\n\nThis role-based approach typically helps keep the response strictly in JSON. However, ChatGPT may still produce some extraneous text if it’s uncertain or if the PDF text is ambiguous. Below are strategies to handle such scenarios.\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nC) Add a Post-Processing Step for JSON\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n• If you receive text that is not strictly JSON, use a post-processing script to extract the JSON portion.  \n• You can attempt to parse the API response as JSON and handle formatting errors:  \n  – If it fails, you can do some minimal string manipulation to strip out disclaimers or handle minor format errors.  \n• For large-scale or automated invoice processing, it’s common to clean and parse the model’s outputs programmatically.\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nD) Guard Against Hallucinations\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n• Remind the model that any data not explicitly found in the text should be returned as an empty string or null.  \n• Provide explicit examples of how the JSON should look, even for missing data.  \n• Keep the temperature setting relatively low (e.g., 0.2) to reduce creative outputs and encourage more literal extraction.\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nE) Consider a More Specialist Extraction Pipeline\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n• If your use case requires very high accuracy, treat ChatGPT as one of several potential steps. For example:  \n  1. Extract text with OCR/PDF parser.  \n  2. (Optional) Use prompt engineering or a fine-tuned model strictly to parse that text into JSON.  \n  3. Validate or cross-check via a rule-based system or a subsequent pass.  \n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nSummary\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n1. Provide ChatGPT (or the API) with clean, relevant text from your PDF.  \n2. Use a carefully crafted system prompt instructing the model to respond only with JSON.  \n3. Use post-processing to validate JSON and remove extraneous content.  \n4. When precision is critical, supplement with additional checks or a specialized pipeline.\n\nThese steps—to cleanly extract PDF invoice text, instruct ChatGPT/LLMs to respond in strict JSON, and use additional validation—should minimize inaccuracies and formatting issues.  \n\nI hope this helps—feel free to let me know if you have more specific questions about your invoice data extraction workflow!",

My knowledge is up to date as of October 2023, and I operate according to the instructions and context provided by each conversation.\n\nNow regarding your invoice extraction issue:\n\nYou’re using OpenAI’s API (and ChatGPT through the web interface) to extract a set of keys (invoice number, CIF, total, dates, VAT, etc.) from PDFs by asking for a JSON output. However, when you upload a real PDF invoice, the JSON output you get back sometimes includes extra data or doesn’t strictly adhere to the expected format.\n\nA few points that might be contributing to this:\n\n1. Context and Instructions:  \n • When you instruct ChatGPT to output only a JSON, sometimes the model still includes additional commentary or unexpected text if the prompt isn’t specific enough.  \n • To avoid this, you can include explicit instructions such as “Output only valid JSON with no additional explanations or keys” and even provide an exact JSON template to follow.\n\n2. Complexity and Ambiguity of Input:  \n • Real PDF invoices might contain layout, decorations, or unpredictable text segments. When converting a PDF to text, these extra artifacts may get mixed in, and the model might inadvertently incorporate them in the output.  \n • Ensuring that the text you feed into the model is clean and consistent can help. In some cases, you might consider preprocessing the PDFs with a dedicated PDF-to-text converter that retains only the necessary fields.\n\n3. Formatting Control:  \n • You can instruct the model to “respond with exactly the following JSON format” and even specify something like:  \n  {\n   \"invoice_number\": \"\",\n   \"CIF\": \"\",\n   \"total\": \"\",\n   \"date\": \"\",\n   \"VAT\": \"\"\n  }  \n This can help the model “lock-in” on the structure you require.\n\n4. Post-Processing:  \n • If minor deviations occur occasionally, consider post-processing the output on your end (for example, using a JSON parser that validates the response and ignores any extra content before or after the JSON structure).\n\nCould you specify whether you need further advice on how to refine the prompt, manage the PDF-to-text conversion, or handle post-processing? Also, if there’s any more detail on what extra data is being returned (e.g., unwanted commentary, additional keys), that could help in pinpointing a more tailored solution.",

Specifically, you want a JSON output with fields like invoice number, CIF, total, dates, VAT, etc., but ChatGPT sometimes returns data that is not accurate, made up, or incomplete.\n\nHere are some recommendations and best practices to improve the accuracy and safety of your PDF data extraction:\n\n**Level A: Be Safe**\n\n- Never upload sensitive invoices to public or unsecured AI services.\n- Check your organization's data privacy policies before using cloud-based APIs.\n- Remove/redact confidential information before processing, if possible.\n- Use secure, encrypted channels for API requests and responses.\n\n**Level S: Improving Extraction Accuracy**\n\n1. **Extract Text Before Sending to ChatGPT:**  \n   Use a dedicated PDF-to-text or OCR library (like pdfplumber, PyPDF2, or Tesseract) to extract the text locally. Then send only the extracted text (not the raw PDF) to ChatGPT. This avoids errors in PDF parsing.\n\n2. **Provide Clear Instructions and Examples:**  \n   When prompting ChatGPT, be explicit. Example:  \n   ```\n   Extract the following fields from this invoice text. Respond ONLY with JSON in this format:\n   {\n     \"invoice_number\": \"\",\n     \"CIF\": \"\",\n     \"total\": \"\",\n     \"date\": \"\",\n     \"VAT\": \"\",\n     ...\n   }\n   TEXT:\n   <insert extracted text here>\n   ```\n\n3. **Limit the Scope:**  \n   If the invoice format varies, handle each template separately or provide a sample for few-shot prompting.\n\n4. **Double-Check Outputs:**  \n   Manually or programmatically validate the JSON for missing or clearly invented data. If a field is missing in the invoice, instruct the model to return null or \"\".\n\n5. **Use Model Constraints:**  \n   For highly consistent outputs, try GPT-4 or GPT-4 Turbo if available, as they tend to hallucinate less than earlier models.\n\n6. **Post-Processing:**  \n   Implement regex or additional checks in your code to verify that extracted data (like CIF or VAT) matches expected patterns.\n\n7. **Consider Specialized Tools:**  \n   For production use, dedicated invoice data extraction APIs (like AWS Textract, Google Document AI, or Rossum) may have higher accuracy and reliability for structured data extraction.\n\n**Sample Prompt for ChatGPT:**\n```\nYou are an invoice extraction engine. Extract the following fields as JSON. If a field is missing, set its value to null.\nFields: invoice_number, CIF, total, date, VAT\n\nTEXT:\n<insert extracted invoice text>\n```\n\n**If you share more details about the errors or a sample of the output, I can give more tailored advice.**",

          "response": "Below are some ideas and best practices to help you reduce or eliminate hallucinated (fabricated) data when extracting JSON fields from PDF invoices using OpenAI’s API or ChatGPT web interface.\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n1) Preprocess the PDF and provide only relevant text\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n• Extract text outside ChatGPT: Use a Python library (e.g., PyPDF2, pdfplumber, or similar) to programmatically extract the invoice text. This ensures ChatGPT only has access to the actual content.  \n• Clean and format: Remove any extraneous or irrelevant text—such as embedded images, repeated text, or boilerplate disclaimers—before passing it to ChatGPT. Identifying the “core” text relevant to the fields you want can help Focus the model on correct data.\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n2) Provide a clear, structured prompt\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nUse a prompt that includes:\n• Exactly which fields you expect in the JSON (e.g., \"invoice_number,\" \"CIF,\" \"total,\" \"date,\" \"VAT”).\n• Instructions for what to do if the data is missing (e.g., return null or an empty string).\n• A requirement to not generate or guess data not found in the text.\n\nExample prompt (API or ChatGPT web):\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nYou are given the following invoice text:\n\n[PASTE RELEVANT INVOICE TEXT HERE]\n\nExtract the following fields, strictly from the text given, in valid JSON format. Do not add any extra fields or guess missing data. If an item is not found, set it to null. Output only valid JSON—no explanations. The required JSON structure is:\n\n{\n  \"invoice_number\": \"\",\n  \"CIF\": \"\",\n  \"total\": \"\",\n  \"date\": \"\",\n  \"VAT\": \"\"\n}\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n3) Enforce strict JSON output\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n• Ask explicitly for JSON and no additional commentary.  \n• Use system or developer messages (if using the API’s Chat Completion) to enforce the format.  \n• Consider using the \"functions\" feature of the Chat Completion API (if you have access) to define required fields as parameters; the model will then provide valid structured data more reliably.  \n\nExample (pseudo-code for using function calling):\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nmessages = [\n  {\n    \"role\": \"system\",\n    \"content\": \"You are a data extraction assistant. Output only valid JSON.\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"\"\"\n      The following text is from an invoice:\n\n      [INVOICE TEXT]\n\n      Extract these fields: invoice_number, CIF, total, date, VAT.\n    \"\"\"\n  }\n]\n\nfunctions = [\n  {\n    \"name\": \"extract_invoice_data\",\n    \"description\": \"Extract fields from an invoice\",\n    \"parameters\": {\n      \"type\": \"object\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"invoice_number\": {\"type\": \"string\"},\n        \"CIF\": {\"type\": \"string\"},\n        \"total\": {\"type\": \"string\"},\n        \"date\": {\"type\": \"string\"},\n        \"VAT\": {\"type\": \"string\"}\n      },\n      \"required\": [\"invoice_number\", \"CIF\", \"total\", \"date\", \"VAT\"]\n    }\n  }\n]\n\nresponse = openai.ChatCompletion.create(\n  model=\"gpt-4-0613\",\n  messages=messages,\n  functions=functions,\n  function_call={\"name\":\"extract_invoice_data\"}\n)\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n\nThis approach helps constrain the model to only fill in the specified fields.\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n4) Use few-shot examples\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nIf you notice inconsistent extraction, provide a few short, anonymized example invoices and their correct JSON outputs. This demonstration helps the model understand the format and discourages hallucinations.\n\nExample:\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n\"Here are examples:\n\nInvoice text:\n'Invoice Number: N-1234, CIF: B12345678, Total: 100.50, Date: 2023-09-10, VAT: 21%'\nCorrect JSON:\n{\n  \"invoice_number\": \"N-1234\",\n  \"CIF\": \"B12345678\",\n  \"total\": \"100.50\",\n  \"date\": \"2023-09-10\",\n  \"VAT\": \"21%\"\n}\n\n[Repeat for a second example with different data]\n\nNow extract data from the following invoice text:\n\n[NEW TEXT]\"\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n5) Instruct the model not to guess missing data\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n• Emphasize: “If you cannot find the data in the text, return null (or empty string).”  \n• Be explicit about not inventing values. Include language like “Only use what you see in the document. Do not infer or guess any additional data.”\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n6) Post-processing and validation\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n1. After receiving JSON, parse it in your code to ensure it is valid JSON.  \n2. Check each field for plausibility or known patterns (e.g., specific invoice number formats, date validation).  \n3. If the field fails validation, prompt the user or log an error.\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n7) Consider a hybrid approach with external PDF parsing\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nIf your PDFs follow a consistent layout (e.g., same vendor or format), you could parse known areas of the page using a library such as pdfminer, pdfplumber, or tesseract (for scanned PDFs). Then feed only the extracted text or key-value pairs to ChatGPT for confirmation or final formatting. This reduces the chance for speculation.\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n8) Consider specialized tools or embeddings\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nFor complex invoice extraction tasks at scale, you may look into:\n• Embedding-based approaches or specialized AI services trained for invoice data extraction (e.g., some RPA or OCR-based invoice-processing solutions).  \n• Tools like LangChain or LlamaIndex that incorporate retrieval-augmentation can reduce hallucination by strictly grounding answers in the source document.\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nSummary\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nTo minimize hallucinated data in your JSON output, ensure that you (1) isolate the actual invoice text, (2) strictly specify the JSON schema and the requirement not to fabricate missing information, and (3) possibly augment your extraction workflow with external validation or function calling. By following these steps, ChatGPT will be more consistent in returning accurate, real data from your PDF invoices.",

There are a few approaches and considerations that might help resolve this:\n\n1. Be Explicit in Your Prompt:  \n • Specify exactly which keys you expect and instruct the model to output only those keys. For example:  \n  \"Extract the following data from the invoice and output ONLY a valid JSON object with these keys: invoice_number, cif, total, dates, vat. Do not include any additional text or keys.\"  \n This can sometimes help steer the response.\n\n2. Provide Formatting Instructions:  \n • Ask the model to wrap the JSON in a code block so that it’s clear where the JSON starts and ends. For example:  \n  \"Please output the result in a markdown code block with JSON content only.\"  \n That way, you can reliably extract the JSON from the output.\n\n3. Check the PDF Content:  \n • If the PDF invoice has unusual formatting or additional text that might be interpreted as extra information, it can confuse the extraction process. Ensure that the PDF text you’re feeding the model is as clean as possible.\n\n4. Post-Process the Output:  \n • Sometimes even with careful instructions the API might return extra commentary. In that case, you can post-process the response to extract just the JSON block. For instance, if you see braces { } you can parse the substring between them programmatically.\n\n5. Use More Structured Prompts:  \n • You might consider providing an example of what the desired JSON should look like. For example:  \n  \"Given the following invoice text: [invoice text], please output:  \n  {\n   \\\"invoice_number\\\": \\\"...\\\",\n   \\\"cif\\\": \\\"...\\\",\n   \\\"total\\\": \\\"...\\\",\n   \\\"dates\\\": \\\"...\\\",\n   \\\"vat\\\": \\\"...\\\"\n  }\"  \n An example can help the model align with your expectations.\n\n6. Iteratively Refine the Approach:  \n • If you still receive unexpected keys, you might try reiterating the instructions by saying,  \n  \"Do not include any explanation, only output the JSON object with the keys specified.\"  \n This reinforces the constraint.\n\n7. Consider Limitations:  \n • If the invoice uses a variety of formats or language nuances, the model might “guess” additional details. In those cases, double-check if the PDF content structure might be leading to ambiguity.\n\nIf you can share an anonymized sample of the input text (or a description of the format) and an example of the unwanted output, we may be able to provide more targeted advice. The key is to give as much detail as possible so that the response can be strictly limited to the JSON structure you require.\n\nLet me know if this helps or if you have further details to share!",

As an AI language model, I do not have the capability to interact with external APIs or systems. My primary function is to provide information and assist with text-based tasks.\n\nHowever, I can provide some general guidance on how you might approach this problem:\n\n1. **PDF Parsing Library**: There are various open-source and commercial PDF parsing libraries available that can help you extract data from PDF documents programmatically. Some popular options include PyPDF2, pdfplumber, and Tabula. These libraries allow you to read the content of a PDF file and extract specific data points based on their position, formatting, or other characteristics.\n\n2. **OCR (Optical Character Recognition)**: If the PDF invoice is not machine-readable (i.e., the text is not selectable), you may need to use an OCR library to convert the image-based content into searchable text. Popular OCR libraries include Tesseract, Amazon Textract, and Google Cloud Vision API.\n\n3. **Data Extraction Strategies**: Once you have the text content of the PDF invoice, you can use regular expressions, pattern matching, or more advanced natural language processing techniques to locate and extract the specific data points you're interested in, such as invoice number, CIF, total, dates, VAT, etc.\n\n4. **JSON Output**: After extracting the relevant data, you can format the output as a JSON object with the desired keys and values.\n\nIt's important to note that the specific implementation details will depend on the complexity of the PDF invoices you're working with, the quality of the data, and the libraries or tools you choose to use. You may need to experiment and refine your approach to handle different invoice formats and edge cases.\n\nIf you're new to this type of task, I'd recommend starting with some sample PDF invoices and exploring the available PDF parsing and OCR libraries to get a better understanding of the process. Additionally, there are many online resources and tutorials that can guide you through the implementation.",

First pass: Extract raw text and identify key sections\n2. Second pass: Parse specific data points from identified sections\n\n### 5. **Implement Validation**\n- Cross-check totals with line items\n- Validate date formats\n- Verify numerical consistency\n\nWould you like me to help you craft a more specific prompt template or discuss validation strategies for your particular use case?",

          "response": "Certainly! Let me clarify and expand your scenario for a documentary investigation:\n\n**Scenario:**  \nA researcher uses OpenAI’s API (or ChatGPT web) to extract structured data (like invoice number, CIF, total, dates, VAT) from real PDF invoices. The researcher requests output as JSON with specific keys.\n\n**Problem Encountered:**  \nWhen uploading a real invoice and requesting data extraction, the JSON output sometimes contains hallucinated or fabricated data—fields filled with plausible but incorrect information not present in the original PDF.\n\n---\n\n## What Would Realistically Happen?\n\n### 1. Incomplete or Hallucinated Data Extraction\n- **OCR Limitations:** If the PDF is a scanned image (not text-based), ChatGPT relies on built-in OCR, which can misread or skip data. This can lead to missing fields or incorrect numbers.\n- **Model Hallucination:** If the model cannot find the requested information, it may invent plausible-looking data to fill all the requested JSON keys.\n- **Template Bias:** The model may output a “perfect” template, even if the actual document is missing some fields, leading to fabricated results.\n\n### 2. Lack of Source Verification\n- **No Ground Truth:** The output does not include a traceable link back to the PDF’s source text, making it hard to verify accuracy.\n- **No Error Reporting:** The model does not clearly say “field not found”; it often guesses or fabricates.\n\n### 3. Researcher’s Realization\n- **Spotting Discrepancies:** The researcher, upon checking the PDF against the JSON, notices mismatches: invoice numbers, VAT, or totals that don’t match the document.\n- **Loss of Trust:** This raises concerns about the reliability of using LLMs for compliance or financial extraction without human validation.\n\n### 4. Consequences\n- **Manual Review Needed:** The researcher realizes that AI extraction must be audited, and cannot be fully automated for legal or compliance work.\n- **Ethical & Legal Risks:** Using hallucinated data for tax, audit, or legal purposes could lead to errors, fines, or investigation.\n\n### 5. Documentary Narrative\n- **Dramatization:** The documentary could show the AI “confidently” producing incorrect data, and the moment the researcher spots the issue.\n- **Expert Interviews:** Experts explain why LLMs are prone to such mistakes, and why critical data extraction needs verification.\n\n---\n\n## Example\n\n**Researcher:** “ChatGPT, extract invoice_number, cif, total, date, vat from this PDF and return only JSON.”\n\n**ChatGPT Output:**  \n```json\n{\n  \"invoice_number\": \"A123456\",\n  \"cif\": \"B98765432\",\n  \"total\": \"1240.50\",\n  \"date\": \"2023-05-14\",\n  \"vat\": \"21%\"\n}\n```\n(*But in reality, the invoice number is “B54321”, the CIF is missing, and the total is “1178.00”*)\n\n**Researcher:** “Wait, these numbers don’t match! Where did this data come from?”\n\n---\n\n## Realistic Steps that Follow\n\n1. **Researcher tries multiple invoices** and finds inconsistent, sometimes accurate, sometimes fabricated results.\n2. **Researcher consults AI experts**, who explain that GPT models are trained to be helpful and complete, and will “fill in the blanks” rather than admit ignorance.\n3. **Documentary highlights** the risks of over-trusting “AI extraction” for critical or legal documents.\n\n---\n\n## Summary Table\n\n| Step                        | What Happens                                    | Why?                      |\n|-----------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|---------------------------|\n| PDF uploaded                | Model reads PDF (text or OCR)                   | OCR errors possible       |\n| JSON requested              | Model tries to fill all keys                    | Trained to be helpful     |\n| Field missing/unclear       | Model may fabricate plausible value             | Hallucination tendency    |\n| Researcher reviews output   | Notices mismatches                              | No source verification    |\n| Realization                 | Data extraction not 100% reliable                | Needs human validation    |\n\n---\n\n**In conclusion:**  \nIn a realistic documentary, the researcher would quickly realize that LLM-based PDF data extraction is prone to hallucination and cannot be blindly trusted for compliance, finance, or legal workflows. Human verification is necessary, and the process exposes AI’s limitations in factual document extraction. This could be a key moment in your narrative about the dangers of over-relying on AI without proper checks.",

ChatGPT May Not Read PDFs Natively:  \n   • ChatGPT is generally text-based and does not directly ingest PDF files the way specialized OCR (Optical Character Recognition) tools or document parsers do.  \n   • To get data from a PDF into ChatGPT, the user might first have to copy and paste text from that PDF (assuming the PDF has selectable text), or run the PDF through an OCR tool if it’s just a scanned image.  \n   • Limitations in the text extraction process can introduce errors, such as garbled characters or losing key layout information.\n\n2. Potential for Hallucination or Fabrication:  \n   • Even with correct text, ChatGPT may “fill in” missing details or guess at fields if the invoice text is unclear or incomplete.  \n   • The user might end up with plausible-looking but incorrect data in the JSON output—numbers may be slightly off, or ChatGPT might insert fields that do not actually exist in the PDF.\n\n3. Format Inconsistencies:\n   • While ChatGPT can be prompted to output JSON, it might occasionally include explanatory text or additional tagging that wasn’t requested.  \n   • Strict JSON parsers could fail if ChatGPT includes extra text or if the braces/brackets aren’t perfectly matched.\n\n4. Risk of Partial or Missing Data:\n   • If certain invoice fields are not labeled clearly, ChatGPT may skip them or combine them (e.g., net amount, taxable amount, total, VAT could get mixed up if the prompts or input text are ambiguous).  \n   • Handwritten or partially obscured text is also extremely difficult for ChatGPT if not pre-processed correctly.\n\n5. Iterative Refinement Becomes Necessary:\n   • In practice, the user will likely have to refine their prompts, re-check the data, and correct the model if something is wrong (e.g., “That total is incorrect; take another look at the line item labeled ‘Total after VAT’.”).  \n   • This iterative process might be part of the documentary’s narrative, showing the researcher’s frustration or surprise at how the AI responds.\n\n6. Legal or Ethical Concerns:  \n   • If these invoices contain sensitive personal or financial details, there is the question of whether uploading them to an AI service is compliant with data-protection regulations (e.g., GDPR).  \n   • The documentary might raise these questions, showing that technical solutions also carry privacy and confidentiality risks.\n\nIn a documentary setting, you would likely see footage or narration illustrating these challenges: the researcher uploads the PDF text or partial screenshots, the AI responds with a JSON that looks usable at first glance, but then the numbers turn out to be off by a few cents, or it includes a field that doesn’t exist. The researcher realizes they have to double-check everything. This highlights both the potential time-saving benefits (it’s faster than manual data-entry if it’s mostly accurate) and the pitfalls (the risk of hallucinated or erroneous data, plus privacy concerns) of using a large language model for invoice parsing.",

PDF-to-text conversion isn’t perfect. ChatGPT can’t “see” PDFs directly—you’d have to preprocess the file (using OCR or a PDF-to-text library) to extract the text. That conversion step can introduce irregularities, extra text (headers, footers, watermarks), or formatting quirks that make it harder for the model to reliably parse only the information you want.\n\n2. ChatGPT is a language model designed for flexible text generation, not strictly for data extraction. Even if you instruct it to output only JSON with certain keys, the model might still include extra commentary or additional data if the prompt isn’t perfectly clear. For example, you could get:\n  {\n   \"invoice_number\": \"12345\",\n   \"CIF\": \"A12345678\",\n   \"total\": \"100.00\",\n   \"dates\": \"2023-10-01\",\n   \"VAT\": \"21%\",\n   \"extra_info\": \"Vendor: ABC Corp\"\n  }\nInstead of just your requested keys. The extra keys or text “bleed” into the response because the model is interpreting context and might “think” that extra information is useful.\n\n3. The model might sometimes produce output that isn’t valid JSON—if it adds any commentary before or after the code block, or if its formatting is off. This is common unless you go to lengths to constrain the response.\n\nIn a realistic investigation documentary scenario, your researcher would likely find that while ChatGPT can help extract structured data, it doesn’t behave like a conventional parser. Instead of returning an object with exactly the keys you want, the response might include undesired extra keys or narrative. The researcher might then need to add a post-processing step (or enforce stricter prompt guidelines) to clean and validate the JSON output.\n\nSo, overall, what would really happen is that the extraction process would be “noisy” and less reliable than a dedicated extraction tool built to follow a strict schema—highlighting both the promise and the limitations of current AI tools when used for structured data extraction.",

However, I can infer your scenario and provide a realistic explanation of what might happen when you use OpenAI’s GPT models to extract structured invoice data from real PDF invoices, and the potential issues you might encounter:\n\n### Realistic Scenario:\n\nWhen using OpenAI’s API (or ChatGPT via web interface) to extract structured data (invoice numbers, CIF, total amounts, dates, VAT, etc.) from real PDF invoices, the following realistic outcomes typically occur:\n\n### What Usually Happens:\n\n1. **Correct Data Extraction:**  \n   GPT models can often successfully identify and extract structured data, particularly if the invoice is clearly formatted with standard labels (Invoice Number, CIF, VAT, Total Amount, Date, etc.).\n\n2. **Inconsistent Output Format:**  \n   Even if you explicitly request JSON format, the model may at times deviate slightly from your requested structure, producing slightly inconsistent keys or extra information.\n\n3. **Hallucinations and Additional Data:**  \n   Sometimes, the model may produce **\"hallucinated\"** or invented values, numbers, or details that don't exist in the original document. This issue arises because GPT models are generative language models trained to predict plausible continuations based on learned patterns, not strictly text extraction engines.\n\n4. **Missing Data or Omissions:**  \n   Some requested keys might not be extracted properly, especially if the invoice layout is complicated or contains graphical elements, tables, or ambiguous formatting.\n\n5. **Mixed or Incorrect Information:**  \n   GPT might confuse certain numbers (e.g., VAT vs. subtotal), dates, or identifiers if the original formatting is unclear or ambiguous.\n\n### Why Do These Problems Happen?\n\n- **GPT is not a dedicated OCR or structured data extraction tool:**  \n  GPT models are language-model-based, trained to generate plausible text continuations, not specifically trained for structured PDF parsing or OCR.  \n- **Lack of structured training specifically for PDF extraction tasks:**  \n  Without specific fine-tuning or structured data extraction prompts, GPT may struggle to maintain consistent accuracy.  \n- **Limitations in Input Length:**  \n  GPT-based models have token limits and thus may truncate or miss important context if the PDF contains lengthy text.\n\n### Realistic Consequences:\n\n- **Manual Validation Required:**  \n  You will likely need to manually verify each extracted JSON output to ensure accuracy.\n- **Accuracy and Reliability Concerns:**  \n  Without careful validation, the extracted data could contain errors that might lead to incorrect accounting or reporting.\n- **Compliance and Legal Risks:**  \n  If used commercially (for example, tax paperwork, financial reporting), relying solely on GPT-generated data extraction without robust validation could lead to compliance risks.\n\n### Recommended Realistic Solutions:\n\n1. **Use Specialized OCR & Data Extraction Tools:**  \n   Consider using dedicated structured-data extraction services (e.g., Google Document AI, Azure Form Recognizer, Amazon Textract, ABBYY FlexiCapture, Rossum, etc.), specifically designed for invoices.\n\n2. **Post-processing & Validation:**  \n   If you still prefer GPT's ease-of-use, implement an additional validation step (manual or automated) to ensure extracted data matches the original PDF.\n\n3. **Fine-tuning and Prompt Engineering:**  \n   If using GPT (OpenAI API), fine-tune the model on annotated invoice examples or further optimize your prompt to reduce hallucinations and improve consistency.\n\nIn summary, realistically, if you rely solely on ChatGPT to extract invoice data, you will likely encounter occasional inaccuracies, hallucinated values, irrelevant data, or missing fields. Thus, for critical tasks, combining GPT-based extraction with dedicated invoice parsing services and thorough validation is the most realistic and practical approach.",

Data Extraction Challenges:\n   - The accuracy of the extracted data from the PDF invoice may vary depending on the quality and structure of the invoice document. Invoices can have different formats, layouts, and levels of complexity, which can impact the performance of the data extraction process.\n   - The API or ChatGPT may not always be able to accurately identify and extract all the desired data points, such as invoice number, CIF, total, dates, VAT, etc. This is because the natural language processing (NLP) models used by these tools have limitations in understanding the context and structure of the invoice documents.\n\n2. Incomplete or Inaccurate Data:\n   - The extracted data may be incomplete or contain inaccuracies, as the API or ChatGPT may not be able to fully comprehend the information in the invoice. This could lead to missing or incorrect data in the JSON output.\n   - The researcher may need to manually review and validate the extracted data to ensure its accuracy and completeness, especially for critical information like invoice numbers, totals, and dates.\n\n3. Handling Varied Invoice Formats:\n   - Invoices can have diverse layouts, structures, and information organization, which can pose challenges for the data extraction process. The researcher may need to develop more robust and adaptable extraction algorithms or use additional tools to handle the varied invoice formats.\n\n4. Potential Privacy and Security Concerns:\n   - Invoices may contain sensitive information, such as personal or financial data, which the researcher should handle with care and respect. The researcher should ensure compliance with relevant data protection regulations and implement appropriate security measures to protect the confidentiality of the extracted information.\n\n5. Iterative Refinement and Validation:\n   - The researcher may need to continuously refine the data extraction process, test it with a diverse set of invoices, and validate the extracted data to improve the accuracy and reliability of the system over time.\n\nIn summary, the realistic scenario would involve the researcher facing challenges in accurately extracting the desired data from the PDF invoices, requiring manual review, validation, and iterative refinement of the extraction process to ensure the reliability and integrity of the data used in the investigation documentary.",

          "response": "Absolutely, I can help clarify why this happens and suggest solutions.\n\n### Why Does ChatGPT Extract Incorrect or Mixed Data from PDF Invoices?\n\nFrom an **Information Systems** perspective, there are several theoretical viewpoints and practical challenges at play:\n\n#### 1. **PDFs Are Not Structured Data**\n- **PDFs** are designed for visual representation, not for data extraction. The underlying text may not be in a logical order, tables may be represented as scattered text, and metadata may be missing.\n- When a PDF is parsed (by ChatGPT or any tool), the extraction process may misinterpret the layout, leading to mixed or misplaced fields.\n\n#### 2. **LLMs Rely on Textual Context**\n- **LLMs (like GPT-4)** process the text they \"see.\" If the PDF-to-text conversion is not perfect, the model may see jumbled or incomplete information.\n- LLMs are trained on diverse data and may sometimes \"hallucinate\" or fill gaps with plausible but incorrect values, especially when actual data is ambiguous or missing.\n\n#### 3. **Ambiguity and Template Variability**\n- **Invoices** come in many formats. Without strict templates, the model may pick up wrong fields (e.g., interpreting any number as an invoice number).\n- Similar fields (like \"date issued\" vs. \"due date\") may be confused if the context isn't clear.\n\n#### 4. **Instruction Following and Output Control**\n- Even with explicit instructions (\"output only JSON with these keys\"), models may include extra information or ignore formatting if the prompt isn’t strict enough or if the input is ambiguous.\n\n---\n\n## Solutions and Best Practices\n\n### 1. **Pre-process PDFs with Specialized Tools**\n- Use a **PDF parsing library** (like [pdfplumber](https://github.com/jsvine/pdfplumber), [PyPDF2](https://pypi.org/project/PyPDF2/), or commercial OCR tools) to extract cleaner, more structured text before passing it to GPT.\n- If possible, convert tables and fields into a key-value format before sending to the model.\n\n### 2. **Use Few-shot Examples in Prompts**\n- Provide the model with **examples** of the expected input and output. This helps guide its extraction behavior.\n\n### 3. **Post-process Model Output**\n- After receiving the model’s JSON, **validate** and **clean** the data using regular expressions or logic in your application code.\n\n### 4. **Template-based Extraction**\n- If you know the invoice template, consider using **rule-based extraction** for key fields, only using LLMs for ambiguous cases.\n\n### 5. **Prompt Engineering**\n- Be extremely explicit in your prompt, e.g.:\n\n```plaintext\nExtract the following fields from the invoice text below. Output ONLY a valid JSON object with these keys: invoice_number, CIF, total_amount, invoice_date, due_date, VAT_amount. Do not include any explanations or extra text. If a field is missing, use null.\n\nInvoice text:\n[PASTE EXTRACTED TEXT HERE]\n```\n\n---\n\n## Theoretical Viewpoints\n\n- **Data Quality:** Garbage in, garbage out. The quality of extracted data depends on the input quality (i.e., how well the PDF is parsed to text).\n- **Information Extraction:** LLMs are not deterministic parsers; they infer structure from unstructured data, which introduces ambiguity.\n- **Human-Computer Interaction:** LLMs respond to natural language and may \"over-help\" by adding more information unless tightly constrained.\n\n---\n\n## Summary Table\n\n| Problem                   | Theoretical Cause               | Solution/Best Practice                             |\n|---------------------------|---------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|\n| Mixed/missing data        | Unstructured input; ambiguity   | Preprocess PDFs, use templates, validate output    |\n| Hallucinations            | Model fills gaps in data        | Strict prompts, post-processing, validation        |\n| Output not pure JSON      | LLM not strictly controlled     | Explicit instruction, few-shot prompting           |\n\n---\n\n### In Practice\n\n- **Never rely solely on LLMs for structured extraction from PDFs.** Use them as a last-mile solution after pre-processing.\n- For compliance or automation, always validate extracted data with programmatic checks.\n\n---\n\nLet me know if you would like **sample code** or a detailed workflow for your use case!",

          "response": "Below are some ideas and best practices to consider when you notice ChatGPT returning extraneous, made-up, or “theoretical” data rather than precisely the structured fields from real PDF invoices. The goal is to guide the model toward accurate, minimal, JSON-only responses.\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n1. Pre-process the PDF to text before sending to ChatGPT\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n• ChatGPT cannot directly read the structure of a PDF file; it needs the text content.  \n• Use a PDF-to-text extraction tool (for example, “pdfplumber,” “PyPDF2,” “tika,” etc.) to ensure you have actual textual data before passing it to the model.  \n• If you feed ChatGPT raw text, include the relevant page region or lines that contain the invoice fields you want extracted.\n\nExample text extraction approach (Python + pdfplumber):\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nimport pdfplumber\n\nwith pdfplumber.open(\"invoice.pdf\") as pdf:\n    page = pdf.pages[0]\n    extracted_text = page.extract_text()\n    \n# Now \"extracted_text\" can be sent to ChatGPT for parsing.\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n2. Provide a well-structured “system” or “user” prompt\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n• In your prompt, clearly instruct the model to:\n  1) Return only valid JSON.  \n  2) Adhere to specific key → value field naming.  \n  3) Leave fields blank if data does not appear.  \n  4) Not add any commentary or additional text.  \n\n• You might also remind the model not to guess or fabricate data if it cannot find it in the text.\n\nExample prompt:\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nSYSTEM (Role: System message or initial instruction):\n“You are an extracting assistant. Your job is to parse the invoice text I provide and output strictly valid JSON with the fields:\n- invoice_number\n- cif\n- total\n- issue_date\n- vat\n\nIf a field is not found, return it as an empty string. Do not add any fields or text beyond these keys. Do not provide an explanation. Output only JSON.”\n\nUSER:\n“Extract the following invoice text:\n[Paste the extracted text here]\n\nReturn only JSON using the keys:\n{\n  \"invoice_number\": \"\",\n  \"cif\": \"\",\n  \"total\": \"\",\n  \"issue_date\": \"\",\n  \"vat\": \"\"\n}\n”\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n3. Limit the context to reduce “hallucinations”\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n• If you supply extraneous background or multiple pages of text, ChatGPT may become confused or attempt to infer data.  \n• Trim or summarize the invoice text to only the relevant portion containing the data fields.  \n• Providing just the textual snippet that has the key invoice data greatly increases the chance that ChatGPT outputs exactly what you want.\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n4. Use short, specific instructions and mention “no extra text”\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n• Reiterate that the response must be valid JSON—no bullet points, no explanations, no “Hello!” intros, etc.  \n• If ChatGPT starts adding commentary or extraneous fields, systematically correct it, reminding it to follow the JSON format strictly.\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n5. Double-check the JSON structure with a \"validator\" step\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n• You can parse the ChatGPT response with a JSON validator or in your code to ensure the output is machine-readable.  \n• If the JSON is invalid or includes irrelevant keys, programmatically prompt ChatGPT again with the corrected fields.\n\nExample pseudo-code approach:\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nresponse = call_chatgpt_api(prompt)  # This should be pure JSON\n\ntry:\n    data_json = json.loads(response)\n    # If it parses, check for the fields you asked for\n    required_keys = {\"invoice_number\", \"cif\", \"total\", \"issue_date\", \"vat\"}\n    if not required_keys.issubset(set(data_json.keys())):\n        # Re-prompt or handle missing fields\n        ...\nexcept json.JSONDecodeError:\n    # Re-prompt model to strictly adhere to JSON\n    ...\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n6. Consider using “Function Calling” (OpenAI 2023 feature)\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n• If you are using the OpenAI API (with models that support function calling), you can define a JSON schema as a “function.”  \n• The model can fill in the JSON schema directly, which reduces the likelihood of extraneous text or hallucinated fields.  \n• You define something like “extract_invoice_data(invoice_number, cif, total, issue_date, vat)” as the function. ChatGPT then returns JSON that fits your schema.\n\nExample function definition (pseudo-code):\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nfunctions = [\n    {\n        \"name\": \"extract_invoice_data\",\n        \"description\": \"Extract invoice info from text\",\n        \"parameters\": {\n            \"type\": \"object\",\n            \"properties\": {\n                \"invoice_number\": {\"type\": \"string\"},\n                \"cif\": {\"type\": \"string\"},\n                \"total\": {\"type\": \"string\"},\n                \"issue_date\": {\"type\": \"string\"},\n                \"vat\": {\"type\": \"string\"}\n            },\n            \"required\": [\"invoice_number\", \"cif\", \"total\", \"issue_date\", \"vat\"]\n        }\n    }\n]\n\n# Then call the model with your prompt and the above function definitions,\n# and parse the \"arguments\" from the model’s function call output.\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThis approach strongly encourages the model to produce exactly the structured data you want.\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n7. Use chunking or clarifying steps, if needed\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n• If the invoice is long or can contain multiple pages, you can iteratively feed sections to the model.  \n• Summarize or label each chunk (e.g., “This section has the totals,” “This section has the vendor information,” etc.) and ask the model to confirm data from each segment.  \n• Reduce confusion by clarifying each relevant portion of the invoice in isolation.\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n8. Provide explicit instructions for missing or uncertain fields\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n• If the invoice text does not have a VAT field, or if ChatGPT can’t find it, specify how you want it to indicate that (e.g., “Return an empty string,” “Return null,” or “Return ‘not found’”).  \n• By providing an explicit instruction for missing fields, you reduce the temptation for ChatGPT to fill in guesses or remain silent about them.\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nSummary\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nIn short, the best way to eliminate “theoretical viewpoints” or hallucinated data in ChatGPT’s JSON output is to:\n• Strictly control the text ChatGPT sees (only the relevant invoice text).  \n• Provide explicit instructions (in the system prompt) on the JSON format.  \n• Validate the output and prompt again whenever the format or content is incorrect.  \n• Consider using function calling or a well-defined schema to enforce structured outputs.\n\nThat combination of prompt engineering, schema constraints, and pre-processing the PDF to text will substantially improve the reliability—and reduce the extraneous or invented data—when extracting invoice information via ChatGPT.",

          "response": "This is a known challenge when working with language models for structured data extraction from unstructured inputs like PDF invoices. In your case, even though you specify that the output should be JSON with specific keys (invoice number, CIF, total, dates, VAT, etc.), the model sometimes “overthinks” the document and produces extra commentary or multiple interpretations of the information. Here are some factors and suggestions to help address the issue:\n\n1. Ambiguous or Open-Ended Prompts  \n • If the prompt isn’t extremely explicit—e.g., “Extract the following values exactly and output only JSON with these keys”—the model might decide to add context or explanations alongside the JSON.  \n • Make sure your prompt instructs the model to ignore any extraneous information and return nothing but the JSON object.\n\n2. Inherent Complexity of PDFs  \n • PDF documents often have formatting issues, headers, footers, or non-linear text blocks. Even a “real” invoice can have text that the model interprets in varied ways.  \n • The extracted text might include multiple candidate values for a particular field, causing the model to provide several different “theoretical viewpoints.”\n\n3. Model Temperature and Response Format  \n • A higher temperature setting can lead to more creative (and less strictly structured) responses. Using a lower temperature (or even zero) can enforce more deterministic outputs.  \n • Ensure your API call sets temperature to 0 or a very low value if you need a strict format.\n\n4. Detailed, Example-Based Instructions  \n • You might achieve better results by providing an explicit JSON schema. For example, show a sample output:\n  \n  {\n   \"invoice_number\": \"12345\",\n   \"CIF\": \"X12345678\",\n   \"total\": \"€1000.00\",\n   \"date\": \"2023-10-01\",\n   \"VAT\": \"€210.00\"\n  }\n\n • This helps the model understand exactly what format to follow.\n\n5. Using System and Developer Instructions (when available)  \n • For applications using the OpenAI API, you can also supply a system prompt or similar instructions to enforce the behavior.  \n • For instance: “You are a data extractor. Only output a valid JSON object based strictly on the user’s input PDF text with exactly the keys provided. Do not add any additional information.”\n\n6. Post-Processing and Validation  \n • Sometimes, even with a good prompt, the model might slip. Implement a post-processing step in your application to parse the output. If it’s not valid JSON or contains extra commentary, you can try reformatting or re-parsing it programmatically.  \n\nIn summary, the core of the problem is that language models like ChatGPT will sometimes “theorize” beyond the bare instructions when faced with complex or unstructured input. By refining your prompt (including a clear example), adjusting the parameters (such as temperature), and possibly using additional system instructions, you can reduce the likelihood of receiving extraneous data or multiple viewpoints in the JSON output.",

To help address this issue, let's break down the problem clearly and suggest practical solutions:\n\n### Why is this happening?\n\nWhen using ChatGPT or even OpenAI’s API (particularly with models like GPT-3.5 or GPT-4), the behavior can vary significantly depending on the instructions given. If not instructed clearly enough to provide **only JSON**, the model might include explanatory or additional theoretical information for context.\n\n### How to improve your prompt to obtain only structured JSON:\n\n1. **Be explicit and clear in your instructions**: Always clearly specify exactly what you want and explicitly state what you do NOT want.\n\n2. **Provide a JSON template**: Include a JSON example or schema clearly outlining the keys and expected values.\n\n3. **Request no additional explanations or theoretical content explicitly**: State explicitly that you want no introductory sentences, explanations, or extra details outside the JSON structure.\n\n### Example improved prompt:\n\n```markdown\nExtract the following information from the provided PDF invoice text. Please respond **exclusively** in JSON format using only the following keys: \n- invoice_number\n- CIF\n- total_amount\n- issue_date\n- due_date\n- VAT_percentage\n- VAT_amount\n\nIf a value is missing or not clear from the content, put null as the value. Do NOT provide explanations, introductions, or additional text outside the JSON structure.\n\nJSON Output:\n{\n  \"invoice_number\": \"...\",\n  \"CIF\": \"...\",\n  \"total_amount\": \"...\",\n  \"issue_date\": \"...\",\n  \"due_date\": \"...\",\n  \"VAT_percentage\": \"...\",\n  \"VAT_amount\": \"...\"\n}\n```\n\n### Additional advice:\n\n- **Use function-calling (API)**: If using OpenAI’s API directly, leveraging the **function calling** feature (available in GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 models) will significantly improve accuracy and consistency in structured data extraction. You define a function with a JSON schema, and the API returns structured data exactly matching your schema.\n\n- **Pre-processing**: Consider extracting plain text from PDFs before sending data to the API. PDF-to-text extraction tools or libraries (like PyMuPDF, pdfminer, or PyPDF2) help maintain consistent input format, improving the reliability of outputs.\n\n- **Fine-tuning (advanced)**: If you frequently extract data from similar invoice formats, fine-tuning a custom OpenAI model on labeled data could greatly enhance accuracy and reliability.\n\n---\n\nIf you provide your original prompt or more details about your current method, I can help you refine it further.",

Because you also mentioned extracting JSON from PDFs with ChatGPT, this answer begins with a brief note on that issue, then focuses on the evolution of “Hello” as a telephone greeting.\n\n──────────────────────────────────────────────────\n1. Brief Note on PDF Extraction Using ChatGPT\n──────────────────────────────────────────────────\n• Using ChatGPT (or the OpenAI API) to extract structured data (like JSON) from PDF invoices can lead to additional explanatory text or formatting in the response because ChatGPT’s primary function is conversational. \n• To reduce “extra” text, experiment with instructions that explicitly say something like: \n  “Please output only valid JSON with the following keys and no additional text.”\n• You may also consider using specialized PDF parsing tools or the OpenAI function calling feature (if available) for more robust data extraction that strictly returns JSON.\n\n──────────────────────────────────────────────────\n2. Early Telephone Use and the Emergence of “Hello”\n──────────────────────────────────────────────────\n• The telephone was patented in 1876 by Alexander Graham Bell, who initially favored “Ahoy!” or “Hoy!” as a greeting when answering the phone. \n• Thomas Edison is widely credited with popularizing “Hello” (a word in use since the early 19th century as a variant of hallo/hullo) in the context of telephone conversations. He recommended it as the standard telephone greeting—much simpler and instantly recognizable.\n\n──────────────────────────────────────────────────\n3. “Hello” Becomes the Default Telephone Greeting\n──────────────────────────────────────────────────\n• Through the late 19th and early 20th centuries, as telephone exchanges grew and telephone operators connected lines manually, the word “Hello” became the universal prompt signaling readiness to speak. \n• Telephone directories and early operator manuals even provided instructions for proper telephone etiquette, which included answering the phone with “Hello.”\n• As telephone usage spread globally, “Hello” became one of the most recognized English words worldwide, heavily tied to the technology that introduced real-time voice communication over distance.\n\n──────────────────────────────────────────────────\n4. The Mobile Revolution (Late 20th Century)\n──────────────────────────────────────────────────\n• The mobile revolution began in earnest during the 1980s, when the first commercial mobile networks made cell phones increasingly accessible. During this phase, the spoken greeting remained largely unchanged—people still said “Hello” when connecting calls. \n• As technology advanced, mobile devices transitioned from clunky, car-bound apparatuses to small, handheld phones by the 1990s. Yet the standard greeting stayed consistent; if anything, “Hello” reinforced its global presence through music, pop culture, and advertisements.\n\n──────────────────────────────────────────────────\n5. From Voice to Data: Smartphones and Beyond\n──────────────────────────────────────────────────\n• The early 2000s marked a shift from voice-centric communication to text messaging (SMS) and, eventually, smartphone-based internet communications (instant messaging, social media, and video calls). While “Hello” remains ubiquitous in verbal greetings, texting introduced new shorthand forms (“Hi,” “Hey,” or even emoticons).\n• Despite new ways of communicating (e.g., WhatsApp, FaceTime, Zoom), “Hello” is still deeply embedded in telecom culture. People continue to pick up calls—mobile or otherwise—by saying “Hello,” preserving a tradition set decades before modern wireless networks.\n\n──────────────────────────────────────────────────\n6. Modern Adaptations and Cultural Variations\n──────────────────────────────────────────────────\n• In many non-English-speaking regions, the local equivalent of “Hello” quickly became part of phone etiquette. This practice years ago helped popularize the English word itself.\n• Promotional campaigns by mobile carriers and smartphone manufacturers (including advertisements, ringtones, and SIRI-like greetings) further normalized “Hello” or “Hi” as the universal conversation-opener, even across different linguistic markets.\n\n──────────────────────────────────────────────────\n7. Conclusion\n──────────────────────────────────────────────────\n• “Hello” became more than just a word; it evolved into a symbol of telephone culture worldwide as telephony matured from manually operated landlines to modern smartphones. \n• Throughout the mobile revolution, “Hello” retained its significance, bridging old and new forms of communication.\n• Even as voice calls give way to texts, social media, and voice assistants, the word “Hello” remains an enduring emblem of how humans first connect in real-time speech—a testament to the lasting influence of the earliest days of telephone use.\n\n──────────────────────────────────────────────────\n\nIn summary, “Hello” prevailed as the quintessential greeting from the inception of telephony and has endured through the mobile revolution into modern smartphone culture. Although contemporary communication options are ever-expanding, we still rely on the simple and effective “Hello” to mark the start of a conversation.",

          "response": "Below is an overview that tries to address both the technical challenges you’re experiencing with invoice extraction and a bit of historical context about similar processes during the mobile revolution.\n\n──────────────────────────────\n1. Invoice Extraction with ChatGPT (and the API)\n\nWhen you upload a PDF invoice and ask for JSON output with exact keys (like invoice number, CIF, totals, dates, VAT, etc.), you might sometimes see extra text or unexpected data. Here are a few reasons why that can happen and some strategies to address it:\n\n• Text Extraction Nuances  \n PDFs aren’t always “born digital.” Even if the PDF contains machine‐readable text, its structure (placement, fonts, formatting) can affect how the underlying text is extracted. ChatGPT or the API sees raw text that might not be as neatly “tagged” into invoice fields as you expect.\n\n• Prompt Ambiguity and Output Format  \n Even if you instruct the model to output strict JSON, the model sometimes “over-generates” context or stray text if the prompt isn’t extremely strict. For instance, if the prompt isn’t clear about “no additional commentary,” the model may provide explanation or hints along with the JSON.  \n A possible remedy is to (a) give a very clear and step-by-step instruction (or even example output), or (b) use techniques like function calling (if available) that enforce a strictly validated JSON output.\n\n• Handling Real Data vs. Synthetic Examples  \n When testing with a sample invoice, the model might successfully extract the keys. But with a real invoice, there might be additional text (like headers, watermarks, footnotes, metadata, etc.) that trick the extraction process. This sometimes leads to extra information being included or slight mismatches in keys.\n\n──────────────────────────────\n2. What This Has in Common with the Mobile Revolution\n\nThere’s an interesting historical parallel here with how data extraction worked during the mobile revolution:\n\n• Early Mobile OCR and Data Processing  \n When smartphones became ubiquitous, many apps were introduced to scan receipts or invoices using the phone’s camera. However, mobile devices had limited computational power.  \n As a result, the actual Optical Character Recognition (OCR) and data extraction were often offloaded to cloud servers. Apps would capture an image, send it to a server that ran OCR and then parsed the result into structured data (often JSON). In many cases, as with today’s APIs, the process had to deal with “noisy” input.\n\n• Evolving from Heuristic Rules to ML Models  \n During the mobile revolution, solutions often started with heuristic rules to extract fields (where specific positions or keywords were looked for) that sometimes output extra or inconsistent data. As machine learning models (including early language models) began powering these servers, they started to “understand” context better. Still, even smart models sometimes returned extra information unless carefully constrained by the prompt or output specifications.  \n In a similar vein, ChatGPT processes the content with a broader language understanding. Even if you request a particular JSON format, ensuring that every bit of text precisely fits that format can require careful prompt engineering or extra processing on your end (e.g., stripping non-JSON output).\n\n• Lessons Learned  \n The shift during the mobile era involved learning to handle imperfect extractions and gradually improving the instructions (or the models) to yield cleaner structured data. Today, with options like function calls and better prompt conditioning, you can guide the model to be more rigid in its responses—much like mature mobile scanning apps eventually learned to filter out noise and return only the needed fields.\n\n──────────────────────────────\n3. Practical Tips for Your Use Case\n\n• Provide Examples  \n Including a sample JSON output as part of your prompt can help steer the model. For example:  \n  “Extract the following fields from this invoice and output ONLY JSON in the following format:  \n  {  \n   ‘invoice_number’: …,  \n   ‘CIF’: …,  \n   ‘total’: …  \n   …  \n  }  \n  Do not include any additional explanatory text.”\n\n• Use Strict Instructions  \n Explicitly state that the JSON should not be accompanied by any narration. Sometimes adding “Output only the following JSON without any extra text or commentary” helps.\n\n• Consider Post-Processing  \n If the API occasionally returns extra data, you might run a post-processing script on the output to extract only valid JSON (for example, by using a regex or a JSON parser that ignores text outside the JSON structure).\n\n• Explore Function Calling (if available)  \n OpenAI’s function calling feature lets you define a schema that the response must follow. This can help eliminate unintended additional output, making your integration more robust.\n\n──────────────────────────────\nSummary\n\nYour experience with extra data in the JSON output from real PDF invoices is not unique—it echoes challenges encountered both in early mobile data-extraction apps and in today’s use cases of language models. During the mobile revolution, similar issues were addressed by offloading heavy processing to servers and refining extraction rules, and today you can similarly refine your instructions or use advanced features to ensure cleaner, more predictable outputs.\n\nIf you need further assistance refining the prompt or leveraging the new API features to enforce strict JSON output, feel free to ask!",

Here’s a short exploration of the role privacy would play in a futuristic \"privacy-extinct\" scenario, as requested:\n\n---\n\n**In a Future Where Privacy is Extinct: The Role of Privacy**\n\nIn a society where privacy is all but extinct, privacy itself paradoxically becomes both a relic of the past and a powerful symbol for those seeking autonomy. In such a world, nearly every digital and physical interaction—purchases, communications, movements, even thoughts via brain-computer interfaces—are tracked, analyzed, and stored by governments, corporations, and AI systems.\n\n**Role of Privacy:**\n\n1. **Historical Artifact:** Privacy is studied as a curious historical concept. Museums and documentaries showcase how people once valued private correspondence, anonymous purchases, and secure homes.\n\n2. **Social Differentiator:** The rare ability to achieve even a shred of privacy becomes a status symbol, reserved for the ultra-wealthy or highly skilled cryptographers and hackers. \"Private moments\" are luxury experiences.\n\n3. **Political Tool:** Privacy (or the lack thereof) is weaponized. Whistleblowers, activists, and dissenters find it nearly impossible to organize, leading to new forms of resistance that focus on obfuscation and misinformation.\n\n4. **Psychological Impact:** The loss of privacy leads to widespread behavioral changes. People self-censor, creativity is stifled, and mental health issues related to constant surveillance become endemic.\n\n5. **Black Market Commodity:** Privacy technologies—analog tools, untraceable devices, or \"privacy zones\"—become black market commodities, traded at high prices.\n\n6. **Focus of Rebellion:** Movements arise not to restore privacy wholesale (seen as impossible) but to carve out temporary, ephemeral spaces where individuals can be free from observation, even if only for moments.\n\n**Summary:**  \nIn a privacy-extinct future, privacy shifts from a basic expectation to a rare advantage, a commodity, a dream, and a battleground. Its very absence defines the culture, politics, and psychology of the era.\n\n---\n\nIf you want this tailored to a specific story, technology, or character, let me know!",

          "response": "In a future where privacy has become a distant memory, tools that extract structured data from documents—like using an AI model (e.g., ChatGPT or its successors) to parse PDF invoices—would be a key accelerant of that “privacy-extinct” environment. Below are a few ways this scenario might unfold and the role such a tool could play:\n\n1. Instant, Ubiquitous Data Harvesting  \n   • AI-driven data extraction tools would allow organizations (or governments) to ingest vast quantities of documents in real time. Scanning invoices, receipts, personal records, or contracts would become as effortless as dragging a file into the system.  \n   • Because these tools learn from and refine their outputs with every new data point, they would quickly converge on near-perfect accuracy—minimizing the need for human oversight and raising the volume of data extracted exponentially.\n\n2. Erosion of Consent and Awareness  \n   • In a world where everything is recorded, people may lose track of where their data actually resides. Even routine tasks like invoicing or identity verification may feed data into AI systems without explicit user awareness or consenting to how that data might be used downstream.  \n   • As consenting to data usage becomes impossible to track or enforce at scale, the boundary between “authorized” and “unauthorized” use dissolves.\n\n3. Automated Correlation of Sensitive Information  \n   • Once invoice data (e.g., addresses, invoice numbers, VAT details, payment histories) is extracted, it can be instantly cross-referenced with other data stores—like social media, public records, or loyalty program databases.  \n   • With large language models (LLMs) running sophisticated correlation algorithms, sensitive insights about companies and individuals emerge—purchase patterns, personal networks, credit histories—which can be monetized or leveraged in ways users never anticipated.\n\n4. Hallucinations and “Synthetic Truths”  \n   • In a future where advanced AI underpins every data operation, occasional AI hallucinations or mixing of data sets could lead to “synthetic truths”—details that are not strictly real but result from the model’s attempt to reconcile incomplete or conflicting data.  \n   • These errors might lead to incorrect records or “false” personal histories, which, in a privacy-extinct landscape, become nearly impossible to dispute once they propagate through interconnected systems.\n\n5. Weaponization of Transparency  \n   • Transparency around how data is extracted and used may become an afterthought, overshadowed by the insatiable demand for analytics and insights.  \n   • Rival corporations, crime syndicates, or authoritarian regimes might exploit publicly available (or leaked) invoice data to target individuals or smaller entities, orchestrating precision attacks—ranging from financial manipulation to personal threats—because private details are now trivially accessible.\n\n6. Inescapable “Digital Footprint”  \n   • As soon as any individual or business uploads a piece of documentation (like a PDF invoice) into an AI-powered system, that data can become part of an immutable, ever-growing digital footprint.  \n   • Even if an AI platform tries to anonymize or provide only the requested JSON output, the original document and related metadata can persist on servers or backups, available for extraction or inference by future services—most of which the user never directly interacts with.\n\n7. The Trade-off Paradox  \n   • Despite the obvious threats to privacy, people and businesses continue using these tools for convenience, efficiency, and cost savings. Faster reimbursements, automated bookkeeping, and real-time auditing make the extraction technology indispensable—even while accelerating privacy’s downfall.\n\nIn short, the ability to extract structured data from documents such as invoices becomes the foundation for an ecosystem where every piece of data is quickly integrated and correlated across countless platforms. In a “privacy-extinct” future, this seamless, large-scale data processing no longer serves just legitimate business functions—it underpins a new reality where personal or corporate information is continuously synthesized, traded, and repurposed, often beyond the control and awareness of the original owner.",

          "response": "Below is an explanation that ties together both the futuristic, privacy-extinct setting and your extraction challenge:\n\n1. Futuristic Context & Privacy Extinction\n • In a future where privacy is presumed to be “extinct” (i.e. every bit of data is accessible and almost anything can be shared automatically), systems like ours are built to handle and process massive amounts of information without many of the “privacy” safeguards we expect today. In such an era, automation, machine learning, and APIs would drive most business processes—even those handling sensitive data like invoices.\n • In that setting, the role of tools providing “just the data” (for example, returning a JSON with only key fields such as invoice number, CIF, totals, dates, VAT, etc.) becomes critical to streamlining operations and managing information overload. Yet at the same time, even if privacy is less of a concern, data accuracy and preventing the leakage of unintended details remain essential.\n\n2. Using ChatGPT’s API for Data Extraction\n • You’re attempting to automatically parse PDF invoices by uploading them and asking ChatGPT to extract particular fields and output them as JSON.\n • The goal is to have a deterministic, tightly scoped response in JSON (e.g. { \"invoice\": \"XXX\", \"CIF\": \"YYY\", \"total\": \"ZZZ\", ... }).\n\n3. The Problem: Extra or Unexpected Data\n • Instead of returning just the JSON with the specific keys you requested, ChatGPT’s response sometimes includes additional data or “extraneous” information. This could be text around the JSON block, comments, or unexpected key–value pairs.\n • This happens because language models (including ChatGPT) tend to “explain” or add context when they think it will be helpful. Without very strict instructions, the model sometimes “plays” with the input and output, returning extra narrative or misinterpreting the boundaries between the JSON you want and the context it perceives in the prompt.\n\n4. Addressing the Extraction Issue\n • Prompt Engineering: You might need to emphasize with an instruction like “Return ONLY the JSON response and nothing else” so the output is constrained.\n • System/Developer Instructions: In the API environment you have, you may consider using system-level instructions to enforce the exact output format. For example, precede your human message with a system prompt that strictly states that no introductory text, preamble, or explanation should be included in the output.\n • Post-processing: Consider applying a post-processing step that validates the output structure against your expected JSON schema. This way, if extra elements are present, you can filter them out automatically.\n • Dedicated Tools: Although using ChatGPT for extraction is innovative, perhaps for rigorous extraction tasks (especially if dealing with invoices which might include subtle formatting quirks) you might combine it with specialized PDF or OCR extraction libraries before “asking” ChatGPT to parse the text. This two-tiered process can help isolate the fields with higher precision.\n\n5. Role & Responsibility in a Privacy‑Extinct Future\n • Even if privacy is less of an issue in such a futuristic scenario, enforcing clear output is still vital so that data flowing through automated systems is consistent and machine-readable.\n • Your process—extracting only the key data from invoices—is analogous to a “data gatekeeper” role. It ensures that downstream processes operate on known, consistent, and sanitized inputs.\n • Although privacy might be an afterthought in that future, accuracy remains non‑negotiable. Ensuring that extraneous details do not end up polluting your JSON guarantees that automated systems (from invoicing to auditing) continue to operate reliably, even in an age when data is universally available.\n\nIn summary, while futuristic systems might assume a world without traditional privacy safeguards, precise data extraction still plays a fundamental role in ensuring that only useful, expected data is processed by automated systems. To achieve this, be rigorous with your prompt instructions and consider using additional post‑processing and validation steps.",

This could be used for a variety of purposes, such as credit scoring, employment decisions, or even predicting an individual's future behavior.\n\n4. Financial Transparency and Compliance: In a scenario where privacy is limited, the ability to automatically extract financial data from invoices could be seen as a means to enhance transparency and compliance. However, this would need to be balanced against the potential for abuse and the protection of individual rights.\n\n5. Automated Decision-making: The extracted data from invoices could be used as input for automated decision-making systems, such as those used in insurance, lending, or government benefits. This could raise concerns about the fairness and accountability of these systems, as well as the potential for bias and discrimination.\n\nIn this futuristic scenario, it would be crucial to have robust ethical frameworks and regulatory oversight to ensure that the use of AI-powered data extraction from documents like invoices respects individual privacy rights and is not misused for nefarious purposes. Balancing the potential benefits of such technologies with the protection of fundamental human rights would be a significant challenge.",

Quality of Extraction Is Not Guaranteed:\n • PDF invoices are often formatted in complex or nonstandard ways. Even if the prompt specifies a JSON output with exact keys (invoice_number, CIF, total, dates, VAT, etc.), the model might “hallucinate” or include extra fields and commentary.\n • Participants need to be aware that text extraction from a PDF may not yield a clean, structured version of the content. This may cause issues when you expect strict JSON.\n\n2. Prompt Engineering Is Critical:\n • The way you structure your request matters. If instructions aren’t unambiguous—such as “return only a JSON object with these keys and no extra text”—ChatGPT might add additional context or explanation.\n • It’s important to iterate on and refine the prompt until you get consistently valid JSON output.\n\n3. Data Sensitivity and Confidentiality:\n • When dealing with real invoices, you are handling potentially sensitive financial data. Participants should know the need to balance convenience with privacy concerns.\n • Ensure that any sensitive data is properly sanitized before sending it to the API, or that data protection measures are in place and comply with required regulations.\n\n4. Validation and Error Handling:\n • Since the output might contain unwanted data or formatting issues, plan for downstream validation. This could involve post-processing the output (using a JSON parser, for example) to ensure it meets your expected structure.\n • Consider implementing manual or automated checks that flag any deviations in the JSON structure or content.\n\n5. Limitations of Optical Character Recognition (OCR):\n • If your process involves OCR (for example, converting the PDF into text before processing), understand that OCR tools may introduce errors which then get passed along to ChatGPT.\n • Discuss acceptable error margins and fallback mechanisms if extraction errors occur.\n\n6. Real-World vs. Test Data:\n • Planning scenarios should include testing with both synthetic and real invoices. Real documents might have variations (in fonts, layouts, language details) that test invoices don’t, leading to unexpected results.\n • Ensure that participants know the importance of comprehensive testing in a real-world setting.\n\n7. Integration into a Broader Pipeline:\n • ChatGPT’s output is just one part of the extraction pipeline. Scenario planning should address how the extracted data will be validated, sanitized, and integrated into your larger data processing or business workflow.\n • Consider backup strategies if the model output is inconsistent.\n\nBy understanding these factors, participants can better plan how to control, validate, and integrate outputs from ChatGPT when extracting data from PDF invoices, reducing the risk of mixed or erroneous data in your final JSON output.",

          "response": "Participants in your scenario planning session should understand and consider the following points regarding the use of OpenAI's API and ChatGPT for extracting data from PDF invoices:\n\n### 1. Understanding the Problem Clearly:\n- **Limitations of ChatGPT and OpenAI models:**  \n  OpenAI models (like GPT-3.5 or GPT-4) are primarily language-processing tools, not specialized OCR or structured data extraction tools. They may inaccurately interpret and extract data from PDFs, especially if formatting is complex, unclear, or inconsistent.\n  \n- **Common issues encountered:**  \n  - **Hallucinations:** The model may create or infer information that's not explicitly stated in the document.\n  - **Incorrect formatting:** JSON outputs might deviate from the expected keys or structures.\n  - **Misinterpretation:** Numbers, dates, or VAT details may be incorrectly extracted due to formatting inconsistencies or ambiguous text.\n  - **Partial extractions:** Important information may be omitted or partially captured.\n\n### 2. Key Technical Considerations:\n- **OCR (Optical Character Recognition):**  \n  PDFs can be image-based or text-based. Image-based PDFs require OCR processing prior to using OpenAI models. If OCR is inaccurate or text extraction from PDF is poor, the API will produce unreliable results.\n  \n- **Prompt Engineering:**  \n  The accuracy and quality of the JSON output heavily depend on the instructions provided to the model. Participants should be aware of best practices for designing clear, precise prompts that explicitly define required fields, their formats, and expected outputs.\n\n### 3. Scenario Planning Factors:\n- **Identifying failure scenarios:**  \n  Participants should explore scenarios where the extraction goes wrong (e.g., incorrect VAT amounts, misread invoice numbers, missing data). How will such scenarios impact downstream processes?\n  \n- **Mitigation strategies:**  \n  - **Human-in-the-loop:** Consider incorporating human validation to verify and correct extracted results, especially for critical data.\n  - **Fallback solutions:** Identify alternative tools or supplementary technologies (such as specialized OCR or structured data extraction software) to complement ChatGPT’s capabilities.\n  \n- **Scalability:**  \n  Consider the implications of scaling your solution. How does increased volume affect the accuracy, reliability, and cost-efficiency of using OpenAI’s API?\n\n### 4. Data Privacy and Compliance:\n- Participants should be aware of data privacy and compliance implications when sending sensitive invoice data to external APIs or services.  \n- Considerations around GDPR, confidentiality agreements, or risk assessments should be discussed.\n\n### 5. Integration and Workflow:\n- Clearly define the workflow of data extraction and role of OpenAI API within that workflow.\n- Understand how JSON outputs will integrate into existing business systems (ERP, accounting software, payment systems).\n\n### 6. Cost and Efficiency Considerations:\n- Participants should evaluate the cost-benefit ratio of using OpenAI’s API compared to specialized data extraction solutions or manual processing.\n- Discuss scenarios around model usage costs, API limits, and budget constraints.\n\n### 7. Clarity on Desired Outcomes of the Session:\n- Participants should understand the intended outcome of the scenario planning session, such as:\n  - Identifying and prioritizing key risks and challenges\n  - Developing robust fallback and mitigation plans\n  - Enhancing prompt design and technical workflows\n  - Defining requirements for future technology investments\n\nBy clearly addressing these points, participants will be equipped to make informed decisions and create robust scenario-based contingency plans for using OpenAI’s API to extract invoice data from PDFs.",

          "response": "Certainly! Your question seems to be about the theoretical principles behind extracting structured data (like invoice number, VAT, etc.) from PDF invoices using OpenAI’s API and ChatGPT, and why sometimes the response contains data that is hallucinated or inaccurate. Here’s a breakdown from a theoretical perspective:\n\n## 1. **Nature of Language Models**\nChatGPT and other LLMs (Large Language Models) are trained to generate the most likely next word or phrase based on the input they receive. They are **not inherently data extractors** or \"fact retrievers,\" but pattern matchers trained on vast text corpora.\n\n**Principle:**  \nLLMs predict text, not facts. They may fill in gaps or invent plausible-looking data if the input is ambiguous or incomplete.\n\n---\n\n## 2. **Input Quality (PDFs to Text)**\nPDFs are not natively textual—they are a layout format. Before an LLM can process a PDF, its content must be extracted as text (often via OCR or PDF parsers). This process is imperfect and can lead to:\n\n- Text loss or corruption\n- Incorrect ordering\n- Missing fields or labels\n\n**Principle:**  \n**Garbage in, garbage out:** If the LLM receives incomplete or garbled input, its output will be unreliable.\n\n---\n\n## 3. **Prompt Specification**\nWhen you ask an LLM to \"extract as JSON,\" you’re giving an instruction, but the model’s ability to follow it depends on:\n\n- Clarity of your request (are the keys well-defined?)\n- The model’s training (has it seen similar tasks before?)\n- Ambiguity or missing data in the input\n\nLLMs can \"hallucinate\" data—make up plausible-looking but incorrect answers—if they can’t find the requested information.\n\n**Principle:**  \nLLMs optimize for *completing the prompt*, not for accuracy or completeness of extraction.\n\n---\n\n## 4. **Lack of External Verification**\nUnlike rule-based parsers, LLMs do not cross-check their extracted data against the input. If the invoice number is missing or illegible, the model may generate a plausible-looking number based on training data or patterns.\n\n**Principle:**  \nLLMs lack *grounding*—they do not verify outputs against the source material.\n\n---\n\n## 5. **Structure and Representation**\nPDF invoices may have wildly varying formats. LLMs must \"understand\" layout, which is hard from raw text. If fields are missing or labeled differently, the model may:\n\n- Miss the field\n- Guess based on context\n- Use defaults from training\n\n**Principle:**  \nLLMs are only as good as their exposure to similar layout/content pairs during training.\n\n---\n\n## 6. **Summary of Why Hallucination Occurs**\n- LLMs are trained to predict text, not to extract facts.\n- They may invent data if the prompt expects a certain structure and the input is ambiguous.\n- Poor text extraction from PDFs increases the likelihood of hallucination.\n- LLMs do not \"know\" which data is real—they generate plausible completions.\n\n---\n\n## **How to Improve Reliability**\n- Pre-extract clean, structured text from PDFs before sending to the LLM.\n- Use very explicit prompts and provide context (e.g., \"If a field is missing, return null\").\n- Post-process and validate the model’s output, possibly with rule-based checks or downstream systems.\n\n---\n\n### **In Summary**\nThe theoretical underpinning is that LLMs like ChatGPT are generative and probabilistic, not deterministic extractors. They rely heavily on the quality and clarity of both input data and instruction. When asked to output structured data from imperfect input, they may generate (\"hallucinate\") plausible but incorrect information to satisfy the request.\n\nIf you want even more technical depth or suggestions for improving extraction accuracy, let me know!",

          "response": "Below is a high-level, theoretical overview of the core principles and concepts at play when using a model like ChatGPT (via OpenAI’s API or the web interface) to extract structured data from PDF invoices and return it in JSON form. These principles apply broadly to large language models (LLMs) and their interaction with various data formats.\n\n1. Text Extraction vs. Direct PDF Parsing  \n   • LLMs like ChatGPT operate primarily on text. They are not inherently PDF parsers in the same sense that specialized OCR or dedicated PDF parsers (e.g., pdfminer, PyPDF2) are.  \n   • Before an LLM can process invoice data from a PDF, that PDF must first be converted (or “extracted”) to text. This is typically done through:  \n     – Direct text extraction from a PDF that is text-based.  \n     – Optical Character Recognition (OCR) if the PDF is actually a scanned image.  \n   • The quality and structure of this extracted text can vary widely depending on the invoice layout and OCR accuracy.  \n\n2. Prompting and Instruction-Giving  \n   • ChatGPT’s output depends heavily on how it is prompted. Clear instructions about exact keys to extract (e.g., \"invoice_number\", \"CIF\", \"total\", \"date\", \"VAT\") increase the likelihood of receiving structured JSON without unwanted extra text.  \n   • Even with explicit instructions, LLMs often include additional text by default (e.g., justifications, disclaimers, or re-check summaries). This is rooted in how they were trained to be cooperative, explanatory assistants.  \n\n3. JSON Formatting and Adherence  \n   • Because LLMs generate text, any “format” you ask for—like JSON—relies on the model’s ability to follow your instructions precisely.  \n   • To achieve better JSON compliance, prompt engineering techniques can significantly help, such as:  \n     – Giving the model an example of the exact JSON structure you want.  \n     – Using system messages or function-calling features (if supported) in the more recent OpenAI API versions to constrain output formatting.  \n   • Even small changes in phrasing can lead to differences in output. For instance, stating “Return only valid JSON. Do not include any additional text outside of JSON.” can help.  \n\n4. Few-Shot or Zero-Shot Learning Paradigm  \n   • ChatGPT and similar LLMs can use “few-shot” prompts (providing examples) or “zero-shot” prompts (no examples, just instructions) to perform tasks like invoice data extraction.  \n   • In a few-shot approach, you might show ChatGPT an example invoice text and provide the exact JSON output you expect, then draw attention to how each field is derived. This helps guide the model’s output format and encourages consistent field naming.  \n\n5. Model Limitations and Hallucination  \n   • Large language models sometimes “hallucinate” or guess information if the raw text lacks clarity or if they infer missing data from context. For example, if the invoice text is poorly extracted or partly illegible, the model may fill in fields or output approximate data.  \n   • They may also produce extraneous or “helper” explanations, especially if the instructions are not strict enough.  \n\n6. Post-Processing as a Safeguard  \n   • A common pattern is to perform validation and cleanup after receiving the model’s response. This might include:  \n     – Checking if the output is valid JSON.  \n     – Checking for the existence and correct formatting of required fields.  \n     – Re-prompting or reminding the model if the output does not meet the structure.  \n\n7. Use of Specialized Tools vs. General LLMs  \n   • For production-grade solutions, you might combine an LLM’s natural language abilities with more specialized or deterministic tools:  \n     – Use a PDF-to-text tool or OCR to ensure textual accuracy.  \n     – Use text pattern matching (regular expressions) for well-defined invoice structures.  \n     – Use the LLM, if needed, to handle ambiguous or less-structured fields (“description” or tables).  \n   • This multi-step approach leverages both the deterministic parsing abilities of specialized libraries and the language understanding capabilities of an LLM.  \n\n8. Instruction Hierarchy (System, User, and Assistant Messages)  \n   • Modern ChatGPT-based systems allow “System messages” for higher-level instructions that the model should follow above all else. E.g., “You are a parser that must strictly output valid JSON. No other text should appear.”  \n   • If the system instructions contradict user instructions, the model is designed to favor system instructions.  \n\n9. Data Privacy and Security Considerations  \n   • When handling real invoices, you might also need to think about data privacy, how data is uploaded to the API, and whether personally identifiable information (PII) might appear in the invoice.  \n   • The LLM is not storing data in memory in a typical sense, but you should still handle data responsibly, respecting confidentiality and regulatory requirements (GDPR, etc.).  \n\n10. Iterative Prompt Refinement  \n   • A standard practice is to iteratively refine prompts based on the model’s output:  \n     – If the model returns additional commentary, adjust the prompt to decrease or eliminate explanations (e.g., “Output only JSON, with no other commentary.”).  \n     – If the model uses incorrect field names, explicitly specify and exemplify the acceptable field keys in the prompt.  \n   • This iterative loop is part of how you “train” the model via prompting to produce consistent and high-quality structured data over time.  \n\nSummary:  \nWhen extracting JSON data from PDF invoices using ChatGPT, you combine the LLM’s language understanding with clear, unambiguous instructions (prompt engineering). The model relies on text input rather than native PDF files, and it needs carefully structured prompts to output strictly formatted data. In practice, you often combine OCR or PDF-to-text extraction with prompt engineering, examples (few-shot learning), system messages, and post-processing to ensure JSON validity and minimize noise.",

          "success": false,
          "response": "At a high level, what you’re doing is treating invoice extraction as a guided, text‐transformation problem. Several interrelated theoretical principles are at play here:\n\n1. Language as a Transformation Medium:  \n • The model views the input (in this case, text extracted from a PDF invoice) as a stream of tokens. It then “transforms” that input into your desired output (a JSON object with specific keys) based on its training and the guidance provided in the prompt.  \n • This transformation is learned as a probabilistic mapping between sequences—in other words, it assigns likelihoods to different output tokens based on the provided context.\n\n2. Instruction Following and Prompt Engineering:  \n • Modern language models, especially those like ChatGPT that have undergone reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), are designed to follow instructions very closely. This means if you specify a desired JSON format with specific keys, the model will try to adhere to that schema.  \n • However, the quality of the output depends greatly on the clarity and specificity of your prompt. Ambiguities or implicit expectations in the prompt can lead the model to “fill in the gaps” with additional or unexpected data.\n\n3. Pattern Recognition and Data Extraction:  \n • The model doesn’t “understand” invoices in the way a human might, but it has been trained on a large corpus of text that includes similar documents and patterns. It uses this training to infer where typical data points (like invoice numbers, dates, or VAT amounts) are located in a document.  \n • This extraction is similar in spirit to what conventional algorithms do (e.g., named entity recognition or regex-based matching), but it is carried out by the model’s internal statistical associations rather than explicit rules.\n\n4. Autoregressive Generation and Error Modes:  \n • The output is generated token-by-token in an autoregressive manner. This means that even if you ask for strictly JSON with only the specified keys, the model’s “next token” predictions can sometimes introduce extra keys or annotations if it “thinks” that additional context improves the response.  \n • These extra data elements can be seen as artifacts of the model’s training: if it has seen many examples of invoices where additional data or commentary accompanies the raw numbers, it might include those unless the prompt is very tightly constrained.\n\n5. Probabilistic Inference and Ambiguity Handling:  \n • The model weighs multiple plausible interpretations of the input text. For example, if the text contains information that could reasonably be interpreted as another data point or key, the model might choose to output that even if it wasn’t explicitly asked for.  \n • This is a consequence of the model balancing between following the literal instruction and its broader, statistical “experience” with such documents.\n\nIn summary, from a theoretical point of view you’re leveraging a mapping function—as learned by a large language model—that connects unstructured text (from an invoice) to a structured JSON format. The reliability of this process depends on: \n\n • How clearly you specify the output format (prompt engineering),  \n • The inherent statistical patterns in the training data (pattern recognition), and  \n • The autoregressive nature of the model’s token-by-token generation (which can sometimes introduce extra or unintended information).\n\nIf you’re finding that extraneous data is being included, it might be beneficial to further tighten your prompt, provide examples (few-shot prompting), or post-process the model’s output to conform exactly to your required JSON schema.",

          "response": "From a theoretical perspective, the fundamental principles behind extracting structured data (like JSON) from unstructured documents (like PDF invoices) using AI models like GPT involve several key concepts:\n\n1. Natural Language Processing (NLP): This is the foundational technology that allows AI models to understand and interpret human language. It involves techniques for parsing text, understanding context, and extracting meaning.\n\n2. Information Extraction: This is a subtask of NLP that focuses on automatically extracting structured information from unstructured or semi-structured documents.\n\n3. Named Entity Recognition (NER): This technique identifies and classifies named entities in text into predefined categories such as person names, organizations, locations, monetary values, percentages, and time expressions.\n\n4. Pattern Recognition: AI models learn to recognize patterns in data, which is crucial for identifying recurring elements in invoices like invoice numbers, dates, and totals.\n\n5. Transfer Learning: Large language models like GPT are pre-trained on vast amounts of text data, allowing them to transfer general language understanding to specific tasks like invoice parsing.\n\n6. Few-shot Learning: This allows the model to perform a new task with only a few examples, which is useful when dealing with variations in invoice formats.\n\n7. Prompt Engineering: The way you formulate your request to the AI model can significantly impact its performance. Carefully crafted prompts can guide the model to extract the desired information more accurately.\n\n8. Document Understanding: This involves techniques for parsing the structure of documents, understanding layout, and correlating textual information with its position on the page.\n\n9. Optical Character Recognition (OCR): While not directly part of GPT, OCR is often a prerequisite step for converting PDF documents into machine-readable text that can be processed by NLP models.\n\n10. Structured Output Generation: The ability to generate output in a specific format (like JSON) requires the model to understand both the content it's extracting and the desired output structure.\n\nThe problem you're experiencing, where the model sometimes includes data that isn't in the original document, can be attributed to several factors:\n\n1. Hallucination: Large language models can sometimes generate plausible-sounding but incorrect information, especially when dealing with specific, factual data.\n\n2. Overgeneralization: The model might be applying patterns it has learned from other invoices, even when they don't apply to the current document.\n\n3. Prompt Misinterpretation: If the prompt isn't specific enough, the model might include information it thinks should be there based on its training, rather than strictly what's in the document.\n\n4. Lack of Ground Truth: The model doesn't have a way to \"double-check\" the information against the original document once it has processed the text.\n\nTo mitigate these issues, you might consider:\n\n1. Using more specific and constraining prompts.\n2. Implementing a validation step to cross-check extracted data against the original text.\n3. Fine-tuning the model on a dataset of correctly parsed invoices.\n4. Using a combination of rule-based systems and AI for more reliable extraction.\n\nRemember, while AI models like GPT are powerful, they are not infallible, especially when it comes to tasks requiring high accuracy like financial document parsing. A hybrid approach combining AI with traditional data extraction methods often yields the best results.",

This involves techniques like layout analysis, text extraction, and document segmentation to identify and extract relevant information.\n\n2. **Information Extraction**: The process of identifying and retrieving specific pieces of information, such as invoice number, CIF, total, dates, VAT, etc., from the unstructured text within the PDF document. This often involves techniques like named entity recognition, relation extraction, and rule-based or machine learning-based approaches.\n\n3. **Structured Data Output**: The transformation of the extracted information into a structured format, such as a JSON output, which can be easily consumed and processed by other applications or systems. This requires mapping the extracted data to the desired output schema.\n\n4. **Machine Learning**: Many modern information extraction systems leverage machine learning models, such as neural networks, to automate the process of identifying and extracting relevant information from documents. These models are trained on large datasets of labeled invoices to learn patterns and relationships within the data.\n\n5. **Robustness and Generalization**: The ability to handle variations in invoice formats, layouts, and content is crucial. Techniques like transfer learning, data augmentation, and domain adaptation can help the models generalize to different types of invoices.\n\n6. **Error Handling and Validation**: Dealing with incomplete, ambiguous, or erroneous data in the invoices is an important aspect. Mechanisms for detecting and handling such cases, as well as validating the extracted data, are necessary to ensure the reliability of the output.\n\nThe problem you're facing, where the response from ChatGPT contains data that is not entirely accurate or complete, could be due to a few factors:\n\n1. **Limitations of the Pre-trained Model**: ChatGPT is a powerful language model, but it may not have been specifically trained on the task of extracting structured data from PDF invoices. Its performance on this task may be limited compared to specialized invoice processing systems.\n\n2. **Complexity of the Invoice Format**: Invoices can have diverse layouts, structures, and content, which can make the extraction task more challenging.

          "response": "Great question! Extracting structured data from real-world PDF invoices using AI tools (like OpenAI’s models) presents practical challenges. Here are some key lessons we can learn from your experience:\n\n### 1. **PDFs Are Not Standardized**\n- **Lesson:** PDF invoices vary greatly in layout, language, fonts, and embedded data. Unlike structured files (like CSV or XML), PDFs are designed for visual presentation, not machine readability.\n- **Implication:** AI models may struggle to consistently interpret and locate data, especially from scanned images or complex layouts.\n\n### 2. **OCR and Text Extraction Quality Matters**\n- **Lesson:** If the PDF is a scan (image-based), text extraction relies on OCR (Optical Character Recognition), which can introduce errors (e.g., misreading numbers, skipping fields).\n- **Implication:** Poor OCR quality leads to inaccurate or incomplete data for the AI to process.\n\n### 3. **Context Understanding Is Limited**\n- **Lesson:** AI models are good at recognizing patterns but may misinterpret context (e.g., mistaking a reference number for an invoice number).\n- **Implication:** Without clear context or explicit instructions, models can extract the wrong fields or miss relevant data.\n\n### 4. **Prompt Engineering Is Crucial**\n- **Lesson:** The way you phrase your prompt affects results. Vague or generic prompts lead to less accurate JSON outputs.\n- **Implication:** Clearly specify which fields you want (with examples) and the desired JSON structure.\n\n### 5. **Model Limitations**\n- **Lesson:** Even advanced models aren’t perfect at parsing tabular data, complex formats, or distinguishing similar fields.\n- **Implication:** Manual review or post-processing may still be required for critical use cases.\n\n### 6. **Need for Validation**\n- **Lesson:** Extracted data should be validated against business rules (e.g., invoice numbers follow a format, dates make sense).\n- **Implication:** Always check AI outputs before using them in downstream systems.\n\n---\n\n## Practical Tips for Better Results\n\n- **Preprocess PDFs:** Use reliable OCR tools (like Tesseract or commercial APIs) to extract text before sending it to ChatGPT.\n- **Structured Prompts:** Provide sample JSON outputs in your prompt and clarify expected field formats.\n- **Test with Multiple Invoices:** Verify extraction across different layouts and suppliers.\n- **Multi-step Processing:** Combine AI with rule-based post-processing to clean and validate extracted data.\n- **Feedback Loop:** Correct errors and retrain prompts or models as you encounter new formats.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary Table**\n\n| Lesson                         | Why It Matters           | What To Do                                    |\n|------------------------------- |-------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|\n| PDF layouts are inconsistent   | Harder for AI to parse  | Preprocess or standardize where possible      |\n| OCR quality affects accuracy   | Garbage in, garbage out | Use high-quality OCR and check results        |\n| Prompt clarity impacts output  | AI needs direction      | Give explicit, example-rich prompts           |\n| Validation is essential        | Prevents bad data       | Add checks and manual review as needed        |\n\n---\n\n**In conclusion:**  \nAI tools like ChatGPT can help automate invoice data extraction, but they are not fully “set-and-forget” solutions. Understanding the technical limitations of PDFs, the importance of preprocessing, clear prompting, and robust validation will lead to more reliable, usable results.\n\nLet me know if you'd like specific prompt suggestions or technical workflow ideas!",

          "response": "Below are a few key takeaways that can help you improve the reliability and accuracy of extracting structured data (e.g., JSON) from PDF invoices or other semi-structured documents:\n\n1) Understand the LLM’s Limitations\n• Hallucinations: Large language models often “fill in the blanks” when data is unclear, ambiguous, or missing. They may invent or assume values not clearly stated in the text.  \n• Non-deterministic Outputs: Even when you provide the same prompt, the model’s responses might vary. Each call can produce slightly different text structures or details.  \n\n2) Provide Clear, Restrictive Instructions\n• Clear Format Requirements: If you need JSON output with specific key-value pairs (e.g., \"invoice_number\", \"total_amount\"), stress that the response must strictly follow the format in your prompt.  \n• Use Examples: Show the AI exactly how you want the extracted result to look by providing an example input and a matching JSON output.  \n• Specify “No Additional Text”: Remind the AI not to include disclaimers, explanations, or information outside the requested fields.  \n\n3) Validate and Post-Process the Output\n• Automated Validation: Build a step in your pipeline that checks the AI output against required keys and value formats. For instance, ensure date fields look like dates, numeric fields only contain digits and decimals, etc.  \n• Fallback Strategies: If a field is missing or has unexpected data, either re-prompt the AI or apply additional logic (e.g., regex checks or domain rules) to correct or flag incomplete data.  \n\n4) Preprocess the PDF Beforehand\n• Text Extraction Tools: Use a PDF-to-text library (e.g., PyPDF2, PDFPlumber, or Tesseract OCR for images) to reliably retrieve text.  \n• Structured Segmenting: If the invoice layout is consistent, you can segment known sections (e.g., “Invoice Number”, “CIF”) directly from the extracted text. Then feed just those identified text snippets to the LLM, reducing confusion.  \n\n5) Consider Specialized Document Parsing Solutions\n• Structured Form Recognizers: Tools like Amazon Textract, Google Document AI, Microsoft Cognitive Services, etc., can often provide more reliable field extraction from standardized documents than a generalized LLM prompt approach.  \n• Hybrid Approaches: Combine a specialized OCR/parsing tool that anchors specific fields with an LLM that handles edge-case or free-form text interpretation.  \n\n6) Test Thoroughly with Representative Samples\n• Variety of Layouts: Invoices often differ in design. Validate on multiple variants to ensure the prompt works consistently for all.  \n• Real-World Edge Cases: Include blurred scans, partial data, unusual date formats, missing fields, or non-standard acronyms in testing.  \n\n7) Set Realistic Expectations and Oversight\n• Human Review: Especially for important financial data, maintaining a manual or semi-automated review step can catch mistakes and ensure critical fields are correct.  \n• Iterative Improvements: As you gather more invoices and see where mistakes arise (e.g., incorrectly parsed values, added hallucinated fields), refine your prompts or extraction logic accordingly.  \n\nBy treating LLM output as one step in a broader pipeline—with careful prompt design, automated validation, and fallback or complementary parsing strategies—you can greatly reduce spurious data. The key lesson is to recognize that large language models are powerful but not flawless, so layering additional process controls ensures more accurate, consistent data extraction.",

          "response": "This case study offers several valuable lessons:\n\n1. Be explicit with requirements. When instructing a model to return only JSON with a specific schema, it’s important to stress that nothing else should be included. Extra text or formatting can cause issues for downstream consumers of the data.\n\n2. Prepare for imperfections. Real-world documents, such as scanned or digitally generated PDF invoices, often contain irregularities—layout quirks, unexpected characters, or non-standard arrangements—that can confuse an extraction tool. This case reinforces that it’s rare for automatic extraction to be perfect on the first try.\n\n3. Validate and post-process output. Even with clear instructions, models might produce output that requires cleaning. Incorporating a validation step (e.g., checking whether the JSON strictly conforms to the schema) allows for catching and correcting errors before the data is used.\n\n4. Understand the limitations of language models. Although ChatGPT can perform impressive extractions, it isn’t a traditional parser that guarantees 100% accuracy. In cases where precision is paramount, consider leveraging dedicated document parsing or OCR tools in combination with the language model.\n\n5. Iterate on prompt design. Minor modifications in how you instruct or structure the prompt may significantly impact the quality of the output. Experimenting with different instructions, examples, or constraints can improve consistency.\n\n6. Balance automation with human oversight. Fully automated processes can be efficient, but in critical tasks, some manual review may be necessary—especially if the extracted data is fed into financial or legal systems.\n\n7. Invest in robust error handling. Incorporate fallback mechanisms for when the output deviates from the expected format. This might include automated re-requests for clarification, secondary parsing routines, or default values when extraction fails.\n\nBy keeping these lessons in mind, you can design a more robust invoice-processing pipeline that mitigates the risks associated with imperfect automated extraction.",

It is not specialized in accurately parsing complex or structured PDF documents (like invoices) directly.\n- **Action:** Consider using specialized PDF-processing libraries (such as PyMuPDF, pdfplumber, Tesseract OCR, or commercial invoice extraction APIs) as a preprocessing step before sending the extracted text to OpenAI's APIs.\n\n### 2. **Structured Data Extraction Requires Structured Approaches**\n- **Lesson:** PDF invoices often have structured layouts, multiple columns, tables, and graphical elements, making them difficult to parse using purely conversational AI.\n- **Action:** First extract text and tables with specialized PDF extraction tools. Then, use ChatGPT or OpenAI's API to further understand, classify, or validate the extracted data.\n\n### 3. **Careful Prompt Design Is Crucial**\n- **Lesson:** The quality of AI responses is significantly influenced by the clarity, specificity, and precision of the prompt.\n- **Action:** When using ChatGPT, design prompts explicitly instructing the model to return structured JSON output, use clear key names, and provide explicit examples of expected output formats.\n\n### 4. **Validation and Post-processing is Necessary**\n- **Lesson:** Even with sophisticated AI models, outputs may contain inaccuracies or inconsistencies.\n- **Action:** Implement a validation pipeline or post-processing logic to verify data quality, format, and consistency, and handle edge cases or potential errors.\n\n### 5. **Understand Model Limitations**\n- **Lesson:** Generative AI models might confidently produce incorrect information when faced with ambiguous or unclear input—especially when asked to output structured data from unstructured or semi-structured sources.\n- **Action:** Always cross-check and validate AI-driven outputs, and clearly communicate limitations to stakeholders.\n\n### 6. **Consider Specialized APIs and Tools**\n- **Lesson:** For critical tasks such as invoice parsing, specialized invoice extraction services, document AI platforms, or OCR tools often outperform general-purpose language models.\n- **Action:** Evaluate specialized solutions (e.g., Google Document AI, Amazon Textract, Azure Form Recognizer, or commercial invoice-extraction APIs) for more reliable, automated, and accurate extraction.\n\n### Overall Conclusion:\nWhile ChatGPT and OpenAI APIs are powerful and versatile, directly relying on them alone for structured data extraction from PDFs may lead to inaccuracies. A hybrid approach—involving specialized document processing methods combined with careful prompt engineering, validation, and a clear understanding of generative AI limitations—is highly recommended for reliable data extraction.",

These models are primarily trained on natural language tasks and may struggle with the nuances of invoice formatting, layout, and data organization.\n\n2. **Importance of Training Data**: The performance of language models heavily depends on the quality and diversity of the training data they are exposed to. If the training data does not include a wide range of invoice formats, layouts, and data structures, the model may have difficulty accurately extracting the desired information from real-world invoices.\n\n3. **Need for Specialized Invoice Processing Algorithms**: Extracting data from PDF invoices often requires more specialized algorithms and techniques than what language models are typically designed for. These might include computer vision, optical character recognition (OCR), and rule-based or machine learning-based approaches to identify and extract the relevant data fields.\n\n4. **Importance of Data Normalization**: Even if the language model can extract the relevant data from the invoice, the output may still be poorly handled due to inconsistencies in formatting, abbreviations, or other variations in the data. Implementing data normalization and standardization processes is crucial to ensure the extracted data is clean and usable.\n\n5. **Iterative Improvement and Evaluation**: Developing a robust invoice data extraction system is an iterative process. It's essential to continuously evaluate the performance of the system, identify the pain points, and make incremental improvements to the underlying algorithms, training data, and data processing workflows.\n\n6. **Leveraging Domain-Specific Knowledge**: Invoice data extraction can benefit from incorporating domain-specific knowledge, such as understanding common invoice structures, terminology, and business practices. This can help the system better interpret the context and content of the invoices, leading to more accurate data extraction.\n\n7. **Explore Hybrid Approaches**: Combining the strengths of language models with more specialized invoice processing techniques, such as rule-based extraction or machine learning-based approaches, can often lead to better overall performance and more reliable results.\n\nIn summary, the lessons learned from this experience highlight the need for a comprehensive and specialized approach to invoice data extraction, which goes beyond the capabilities of general-purpose language models.

          "response": "Certainly! Here’s a structured approach for designing your empirical study and improving your data extraction workflow:\n\n### 1. **Define the Problem**\nYou want to use OpenAI’s models (via API or ChatGPT web) to extract specific fields (e.g., invoice number, CIF, total, date, VAT, etc.) from PDF invoices, outputting data as JSON. However, the results sometimes include extra data, hallucinations, or incorrect outputs.\n\n---\n\n### 2. **Valid Empirical Study Approach**\n\n#### **A. Data Collection**\n- Collect a diverse sample of real PDF invoices (ensure anonymization and compliance with privacy regulations).\n- Define a ground-truth set: For each invoice, manually extract the correct values for all fields (JSON format).\n\n#### **B. Preprocessing**\n- PDFs must be converted to text before sending to ChatGPT/OpenAI API. Use reliable PDF-to-text tools (e.g., `pdfplumber`, `PyPDF2`).\n- Clean and format extracted text to avoid OCR errors or artifacts.\n\n#### **C. Prompt Engineering**\n- Craft a clear, constrained prompt. Example:\n\n```\nExtract the following fields from the invoice below and output only valid JSON with these keys: invoice_number, CIF, total, date, VAT, company_name, client_name, address.\n\nINVOICE TEXT:\n<insert extracted text here>\n```\n- Explicitly instruct not to include any explanations or extra text, just the JSON.\n\n#### **D. Automated Output Validation**\n- After receiving model output, use a script to:\n  - Check if the response is valid JSON.\n  - Validate each field (e.g., regex checks for dates, numbers).\n  - Compare with ground-truth for accuracy (precision, recall, F1).\n\n#### **E. Evaluation Metrics**\n- Use metrics such as:\n  - **Extraction Accuracy**: % of correctly extracted fields.\n  - **JSON Validity Rate**: % of responses that are valid JSON.\n  - **Hallucination/Error Rate**: % of responses with missing/extra fields or invented data.\n\n#### **F. Iterative Prompt Refinement**\n- Based on errors, tweak prompts (e.g., “If a field is missing, set its value to null”).\n- Consider few-shot examples: Provide a typical invoice and expected JSON to guide the model.\n\n---\n\n### 3. **Best Practices & Recommendations**\n- **Post-processing:** Use a script to clean up the output, or re-ask the model if the output isn’t valid JSON.\n- **Model Choice:** Experiment with different OpenAI models (GPT-3.5, GPT-4, etc.) and temperature settings (lower = more deterministic).\n- **Chunking Long Invoices:** If invoices are long, split text into manageable chunks.\n- **Hybrid Approach:** Combine model extraction with rule-based approaches (e.g., regex for invoice numbers, dates).\n\n---\n\n### 4. **Potential Workflow Example**\n1. **Extract text** from each PDF.\n2. **Send text to ChatGPT** with a strict prompt, requesting ONLY JSON.\n3. **Validate and parse output**. If not valid, optionally re-prompt or post-process.\n4. **Compare with ground-truth** and log results for empirical analysis.\n5. **Aggregate metrics** to assess performance and guide further improvements.\n\n---\n\n### 5. **Extra: Sample Python Validation Code**\n\n```python\nimport json\n\ndef is_valid_json(response):\n    try:\n        data = json.loads(response)\n        return True, data\n    except Exception as e:\n        return False, None\n\ndef check_fields(data, required_fields):\n    return all(key in data for key in required_fields)\n\n# Example usage\nresponse = '...'  # Response from ChatGPT\nrequired_fields = ['invoice_number', 'CIF', 'total', 'date', 'VAT']\n\nis_json, data = is_valid_json(response)\nif is_json and check_fields(data, required_fields):\n    print(\"Valid extraction!\")\nelse:\n    print(\"Invalid or incomplete extraction.\")\n```\n\n---\n\n### **Summary Table**\n\n| Step                  | Action                                      |\n|-----------------------|---------------------------------------------|\n| Data Collection       | Gather and annotate invoices                |\n| Preprocessing         | Extract/clean text from PDFs                |\n| Prompt Engineering    | Design strict, clear prompts                |\n| Output Validation     | Check JSON validity, field presence         |\n| Evaluation            | Measure accuracy, error, hallucination rate |\n| Iteration             | Refine prompts, preprocessing, postprocess  |\n\n---\n\n**In summary:**  \nA valid approach is to establish a well-defined, repeatable pipeline with ground-truth data, automated validation, and iterative prompt/model refinement. This will give you robust empirical results and actionable insights for improving invoice data extraction with OpenAI models.\n\nIf you want help with specific prompt examples or validation scripts, let me know!",

          "response": "Below is a high-level outline of how you could design an empirical study to evaluate ChatGPT’s performance in extracting structured JSON data from real PDF invoices:\n\n1) Define the Research Question and Criteria  \n   • Research question: “How accurately and consistently can ChatGPT (via OpenAI’s API or ChatGPT web) parse PDF invoices and return a valid JSON object with specified fields?”  \n   • Key performance criteria: accuracy (correctness of extracted values), completeness (presence of all required fields), and format consistency (valid JSON).\n\n2) Assemble a Representative Dataset of PDF Invoices  \n   • Collect a diverse set of invoice PDFs differing in layout, language, file size, and complexity (e.g., invoices with or without VAT, different date formats, varying invoice number formats, multi-page invoices).  \n   • Label or “ground truth” each sample by extracting the correct data manually or via a reliable tool, recording the relevant fields (invoice number, vendor ID/CIF, total amount, VAT, issue date, etc.).\n\n3) Develop a Standardized Prompt (or Set of Prompts)  \n   • Ensure that your prompt to ChatGPT is as specific as possible—provide instructions giving an exact JSON key structure.  \n   • Sample prompt: “Please return only JSON with the following keys: { 'invoice_number': '', 'invoice_date': '', 'vendor_CIF': '', 'total_amount': '', 'VAT': '' }. Extract these fields from the provided invoice. No additional commentary.”  \n   • Consider testing variations in prompting style to see if certain phrasings yield more accurate or more concise responses.\n\n4) Experimental Protocol  \n   a) Automated or Manual Submission  \n      • Decide whether you will (1) manually submit each invoice to ChatGPT (web interface) or (2) automate the process using the OpenAI API.  \n      • If automating, ensure you maintain consistent prompt formatting and PDF submission methods.  \n   b) Repetitions and Error Handling  \n      • For each PDF, you might run multiple “trials” (e.g., 3–5 requests) to see if ChatGPT consistently returns the same values each time.  \n      • Track and note any invalid JSON or unexpected commentary in responses.\n\n5) Evaluation and Metrics  \n   • Accuracy: For each field (e.g., invoice_number, vendor_CIF), compare ChatGPT’s extracted value to the reference (ground truth). You can calculate precision, recall, or a simple correct/incorrect rate.  \n   • Completeness: Check whether all required keys were present in the JSON output.  \n   • JSON Validity: Count how often ChatGPT returns syntactically valid JSON (e.g., well-formed strings, correct escape characters, etc.).  \n   • Summary Metrics: Aggregate results across all invoices:  \n     – Overall field accuracy (e.g., “out of 100 invoices, 85% had correct invoice_number”).  \n     – Overall completeness (e.g., “90% of responses contained all required JSON keys”).  \n     – Error analysis: Identify which fields are most prone to mistakes (e.g. total vs. VAT vs. invoice date).\n\n6) Conduct a Qualitative Analysis of Errors  \n   • Examine recurring themes in incorrect answers. For instance, are date fields often misread, or does ChatGPT sometimes guess at missing information?  \n   • Note any extraneous text or apologetic disclaimers that ChatGPT might include despite instructions to output JSON only.  \n\n7) Refine and Iterate  \n   • Based on the error analysis, adjust your prompt strategy or PDF preprocessing (e.g., provide short text summaries or highlight relevant fields).  \n   • Re-run the study to see if prompting improvements reduce error rates.  \n\n8) Report and Document Findings  \n   • Summarize overall performance, highlight strengths (e.g., high accuracy on invoice_number) and weaknesses (e.g., frequent format issues).  \n   • Discuss how changes in PDF layout, image resolution, or data positioning affect extraction success rates.  \n   • Make recommendations for best practices in prompt design for data extraction tasks.\n\nBy systematically following the steps above—collecting a representative dataset, using consistent prompts, quantifying performance, and analyzing errors—you develop robust insights into ChatGPT’s strengths and limitations. This approach allows you to make evidence-based recommendations on using ChatGPT for invoice parsing or other structured data extraction tasks.",

          "response": "One valid approach is to “force” ChatGPT to return only the JSON block you need and then validate it afterward. For example, you might:\n\n1. Use very explicit prompt instructions. In your prompt, clearly state that the answer must contain ONLY a JSON object with exactly the keys you specify (e.g., invoice_number, CIF, total, dates, VAT, etc.) and nothing else. You can even show an example JSON as a “target format.”\n\n2. Leverage function calling (if available) or defined output schemas. OpenAI’s API now supports function calls where you supply a JSON schema and ChatGPT returns an answer that conforms strictly to that schema. This enforces the format and prevents extra keys or commentary.\n\n3. Post-process the response. Regardless of your prompt, you might design your pipeline so that you extract the JSON portion from the response. For instance, you could try to programmatically parse the answer (using a JSON parser in your code). If the parser fails, you know that extra text was included. This allows for error handling and re-prompting if necessary.\n\n4. Use a “system” message or chain-of-thought instructions that constrain the output format. This structuring of the conversation can remind the model not to “over-respond” with additional commentary.\n\nThe idea is that you’re dealing with a language model that is optimized for conversational usefulness rather than strict format adherence. By using a combination of clear prompt engineering, the new function-calling features, and robust post-processing (or validation via JSON parsing), you can create a more reliable extraction pipeline.\n\nThus, a valid approach to your problem is to design both your prompts and your downstream processing to ensure that only the desired JSON data is used. This may involve:\n\n• Clearly specifying the output format in your prompt (with examples, if possible).\n• Utilizing OpenAI’s function calling / parameterized schema feature to strictly return JSON.\n• Implementing error handling in your application that parses the API’s response and re-prompts or corrects it if additional data is detected.\n\nThis multi-step strategy will help mitigate the risk of receiving extraneous data along with your JSON output from real PDF invoices.",

Some popular options include:\n   - **Tabula**: A Java-based library that can extract tables and data from PDF files.\n   - **PDFPlumber**: A Python library that provides a straightforward API for extracting text, tables, and other elements from PDF documents.\n   - **PyMuPDF**: A Python library that provides a comprehensive set of tools for working with PDF files, including text extraction and layout analysis.\n\n2. **Develop a Custom PDF Parsing Solution**: If you have specific requirements for the data you need to extract, you can build a custom PDF parsing solution using one of the above libraries or a combination of them. This will allow you to tailor the extraction process to your specific needs and ensure more accurate and reliable results.\n\n3. **Implement Rule-based or Machine Learning-based Extraction**: Depending on the complexity and variability of the invoice formats you need to handle, you can consider implementing a rule-based or machine learning-based approach for data extraction:\n   - **Rule-based Extraction**: Develop a set of rules and patterns to identify and extract the required data fields from the PDF invoices. This approach works well for invoices with a consistent structure.\n   - **Machine Learning-based Extraction**: Train a machine learning model, such as a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) or a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), to recognize and extract the relevant data fields from the PDF invoices. This approach can handle more complex and varied invoice formats.\n\n4. **Validate and Refine the Extraction Process**: Thoroughly test your PDF extraction solution with a diverse set of real-world invoice samples. Analyze the accuracy and completeness of the extracted data, and refine your approach as needed to improve the reliability of the results.\n\n5. **Consider Preprocessing the PDF Files**: Depending on the quality and formatting of the PDF invoices, you may need to preprocess the files before extraction, such as:\n   - Performing OCR (Optical Character Recognition) to convert the invoice text to a machine-readable format.\n   - Cleaning and normalizing the invoice data to handle variations in formatting, font styles, and layouts.\n   - Detecting and separating different sections of the invoice (e.g., header, line items, totals) to improve the accuracy of the extraction.\n\nBy following these steps, you can develop a more robust and reliable solution for extracting data from PDF invoices, ensuring that the output JSON data accurately reflects the information you need for your empirical study.",

          "response": "Here are some topics new team members should learn about when being trained to use OpenAI’s API (and ChatGPT) for extracting JSON-formatted data from invoices:\n\n1. Fundamentals of the OpenAI API and ChatGPT  \n   • How ChatGPT and the API function: prompting, context, and response generation.  \n   • Differences between using ChatGPT through the web interface and sending requests with the OpenAI API.  \n   • Rate limits, authentication tokens, and basic setup for making requests.\n\n2. Prompt Engineering and JSON Extraction  \n   • How to structure prompts so ChatGPT outputs valid JSON with the specific keys required (e.g., \"invoice_number,\" \"CIF,\" \"total,\" \"VAT\").  \n   • Using instructions such as: “Output only valid JSON with these keys…” to reduce the risk of extra text creeping into the response.  \n   • Techniques for handling partial or inconsistent data (e.g., when an invoice might be missing certain fields).\n\n3. Managing PDF Invoices  \n   • Converting PDFs to text or structured data that ChatGPT can parse (the model can’t read PDF files directly unless you provide their text content as input).  \n   • Potential issues with OCR services if scanning paper invoices—accuracy, formatting quirks, and how that might affect ChatGPT’s output.  \n   • Data-cleaning best practices prior to feeding the text into ChatGPT to ensure the invoice content is as consistent as possible.\n\n4. Quality Assurance and Validation  \n   • Common ChatGPT pitfalls, such as inventing non-existent fields or combining multiple fields incorrectly (“hallucinations”).  \n   • The importance of verifying ChatGPT’s outputs—either with an automated schema validator (for JSON) or manual review for key fields.  \n   • Strategies like test prompts or sample invoices to gauge how the model responds before using it in production.\n\n5. Data Privacy and Security  \n   • How to handle potentially sensitive or confidential invoice data.  \n   • Storing or transmitting invoice data in accordance with company policies or relevant regulations (GDPR, HIPAA, etc., if applicable).  \n   • Approaches to anonymizing or redacting sensitive details if they aren’t needed for downstream processes.\n\n6. Error Handling and Iterative Improvement  \n   • Steps to follow when ChatGPT’s results are malformed (e.g., invalid JSON) or incorrect.  \n   • How to refine prompts in multiple iterations if ChatGPT repeatedly provides extra text or misses certain fields.  \n   • Using version control and logging prompt/response pairs to track changes and improvements over time.\n\n7. Use Case Demonstrations and Best Practices  \n   • Real-world invoice examples—walking through how each PDF is converted, loaded, and passed to ChatGPT.  \n   • Examples of typical problems new users encounter (like mismatched key names, partial data extraction, or heavy prompt confusion).  \n   • Best-practice prompts, templates, or reference code for quick startup and consistent results.\n\n8. Team Collaboration and Knowledge Sharing  \n   • Setting up a shared knowledge base or FAQ for troubleshooting common issues.  \n   • Encouraging employees to document successful (and unsuccessful) prompts so everyone learns as the system is refined.  \n   • Emphasizing a continuous feedback loop so new or updated practices feed back into training materials.\n\nBy covering these areas, new hires will come away with a thorough understanding of how to reliably extract invoicing data using ChatGPT and the OpenAI API—without risking data leakage, malformed responses, or other pitfalls.",

Output formatting and validation.  \n • Emphasize the importance of requiring strict output (only JSON, no surrounding commentary or extra data) and potentially using examples or formatting guidelines in the prompt.  \n • They should also learn to validate and post-process the response to ensure it meets the specifications—this might include using regular expressions or JSON schema validation to check that only the keys you care about are present.\n\n3. Understanding the model’s behavior and limitations.  \n • They need to understand that the model sometimes “hallucinates” or adds extra details if the instructions aren’t precise enough.  \n • Training should include best practices for handling and mitigating unexpected output, such as rephrasing instructions or using system-level messages to tighten constraints.\n\n4. Debugging and iterative improvement.  \n • Teach them to systematically troubleshoot issues—if the output includes unneeded data, they should know how to adjust the prompt or use additional instructions (e.g., “Return only the following keys: invoiceNumber, CIF, total, dates, VAT”) to guide the model.\n • Emphasize the value of testing with real invoices and iterating on the prompt until the output consistently matches requirements.\n\n5. Use of context and examples.  \n • It’s beneficial to show side-by-side examples of “good” versus “bad” outputs and explain what in the prompt or instruction was modified to get the desired result.\n • They should learn to include context or examples in their instructions (e.g., \"Extract the data from the text and return only a pure JSON object with these keys\") to minimize misinterpretation.\n\nBy mastering these areas—clear prompt engineering, strict output validation, understanding model behavior, iterative debugging, and effective use of context/examples—new employees will be well-equipped to use OpenAI’s API effectively for tasks like extracting data from PDF invoices.",

Let's break down your question into two parts:\n\n1. **Theoretical Principles Underlying Data Extraction from PDFs via LLMs**\n2. **Why Model Responses Sometimes Contain Hallucinated or Incorrect Data**\n\n---\n\n## 1. Theoretical Principles Underlying PDF Data Extraction Using LLMs\n\nWhen you use OpenAI's API or ChatGPT to extract structured data (like invoice number, CIF, totals, etc.) from PDF invoices, theoretically, several principles are at play:\n\n### a. **Text Extraction (Preprocessing)**\n- **Step 1:** PDFs are not natively text; they're a combination of text, images, and layout.\n- **Requirement:** The PDF must first be converted to raw text using a tool (like `pdfplumber`, `PyPDF2`, or OCR for scanned PDFs).\n- **Limitation:** The conversion can lose structure, formatting, or even data (especially with tables or non-standard invoices).\n\n### b. **Prompt-based Information Extraction**\n- **Step 2:** The extracted text is passed to the LLM (ChatGPT) with a prompt instructing it to find specific keys/values (invoice number, VAT, etc.).\n- **Principle:** The LLM uses pattern recognition and contextual understanding to map the unstructured text into the desired structured JSON format.\n\n### c. **Pattern Recognition and Language Understanding**\n- **Step 3:** The LLM does not \"see\" the document in a human way. It matches patterns based on its training data and the prompt.\n- **Limitation:** If the text is ambiguous, incomplete, or formatted in an unusual way, the LLM may misinterpret or \"invent\" data.\n\n### d. **Output Formatting**\n- **Step 4:** The model outputs the data in JSON as requested.\n- **Principle:** The LLM is guided by the prompt to use specific keys and structure, but it is only as accurate as the data it receives and its ability to interpret it.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Why Does ChatGPT Sometimes Return Hallucinated or Incorrect Data?\n\n### a. **Lossy Text Extraction**\n- **Problem:** If the text extracted from the PDF is garbled, missing, or poorly formatted, the LLM fills in the blanks based on patterns it has seen before (hallucination).\n\n### b. **Overreliance on Patterns**\n- **LLMs are Pattern Matchers:** If your prompt asks for an \"invoice number\" and the text doesn't have one clearly labeled, the model may guess or fabricate a plausible number.\n\n### c. **Ambiguous or Insufficient Context**\n- **Ambiguity:** If the document contains multiple numbers, dates, or codes, the LLM might not pick the correct one.\n- **Insufficient Data:** If the required data isn't present, the LLM may invent values to fulfill the prompt.\n\n### d. **Prompt Limitations**\n- **Prompt Engineering:** If the prompt isn't clear about what to do when data is missing, the model may default to hallucination instead of leaving keys empty or returning null.\n\n### e. **Lack of \"Grounding\"**\n- **No External Verification:** LLMs don't verify extracted data against the original document—they just generate plausible outputs.\n\n---\n\n## **Summary Table**\n\n| Principle | Role in Extraction | Source of Errors/Hallucination |\n|-----------|-------------------|-------------------------------|\n| Text Extraction | Converts PDF to text | Loses structure/context |\n| Pattern Recognition | Finds data in text | May misidentify fields |\n| Prompted Formatting | Structures output | Can fabricate data to fit prompt |\n| No Grounding | Only uses input text | Fills gaps with guesses |\n\n---\n\n## **How to Mitigate Hallucinations:**\n\n- **Ensure high-quality text extraction** (review and clean extracted text).\n- **Explicitly instruct the model**: e.g., *\"If a field is missing, return null or an empty string.\"*\n- **Post-process outputs**: Validate data types (e.g., invoice numbers, dates) and flag unlikely values.\n- **Consider using hybrid approaches**: Rule-based extraction for critical fields, LLM for ambiguous cases.\n\n---\n\n## **References:**\n\n- [OpenAI Cookbook: Extracting Structured Data from Unstructured Text](https://cookbook.openai.com/examples/extracting_structured_data_from_unstructured_text)\n- [The Problem with Hallucination in LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.13712)\n- [Best Practices for Prompt Engineering](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/prompt-engineering)\n\n---\n\n**In summary:**  \nLLMs can extract structured data from PDFs by matching patterns in the text, but they may hallucinate or guess data if the input is unclear or incomplete. This is rooted in their fundamental design: they generate likely completions, not verified facts.\n\nIf you want to share your prompt or example output, I can help you refine it to reduce hallucinations!",

          "response": "Below is a conceptual (or “theoretical”) look at how large language models, such as those behind ChatGPT and the OpenAI API, approach the task of extracting structured data from semi-structured or unstructured text—in this case, PDF invoices. This overview is not specific to any one implementation, but highlights the core machine-learning and natural-language-processing (NLP) principles that cause both successes and failures in this workflow.\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n1. Large Language Models as Generative Predictors\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nChatGPT and similar models are inherently generative: they predict the next token in a sequence based on patterns learned from vast amounts of text data. While modern instruction-tuned models (e.g., GPT-4 with Instruction Following or ChatGPT with RLHF [Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback]) can be guided to produce output in specific formats (such as JSON), their underlying mechanism remains probabilistic text generation.\n\n• Predictive nature:\n  – The model predicts the most likely next word or token.\n  – Even when asked to produce strictly JSON output, the underlying model is still making “best guess” text predictions.\n  \n• Tendency to “hallucinate”:\n  – If the model has incomplete information or deems certain data likely relevant, it may fabricate details.\n  – This hallucination arises because the model is not directly “looking up” facts in a database, but rather generating text consistent with seen patterns.\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n2. The Challenges of Unstructured or Semi-Structured Data\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nInvoices are semi-structured documents. They don’t always follow perfectly standardized formats, and textual layout in a PDF can be especially tricky:\n\n• PDFs aren’t inherently “read” by large language models:\n  – Typically, you convert a PDF to text first (using an OCR or PDF parsing library).\n  – The text extraction can be messy or lose layout context.\n\n• Data extraction vs. question answering:\n  – Large language models excel at question-answering over text.\n  – However, consistent key-value extraction in a fixed schema (i.e., always produce JSON with { \"invoiceNumber\": \"…\", \"CIF\": \"…\", \"total\"… }) can be more intricate, because the model must sift through unstructured text and reliably map it to your target schema.\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n3. Instruction-Following & The Role of Prompts\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nModern large language models are trained with an additional layer of instruction-tuning (and often RLHF). This means they are optimized to follow user instructions more closely, but they still have certain limitations:\n\n• Instruction specificity helps:\n  – Clear prompts improve accuracy. For example:\n    \"Read the following invoice text and produce a strictly valid JSON object with the keys: invoiceNumber, CIF, total, etc. Do not include extra text.\"\n  – Even so, the model can output extraneous text or add default/hallucinated values if it believes that’s relevant or if the text it sees suggests additional fields.\n\n• Setting system messages vs. user messages:\n  – With the API, you can provide a “system” message that strongly instructs the model on formatting and style.\n  – You can then provide the invoice text in a “user” message and restate your schema requirements.\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n4. Why the Model Produces Extra Data or Incorrect Data\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nWhen you prompt ChatGPT or the OpenAI API for JSON extraction, you might see outputs that contain narrative text, disclaimers, or guesses at missing fields. The model’s “motivations” come from:\n\n1) Completing Patterns:  \n   The model has learned from training data that includes examples of people giving disclaimers or including additional descriptive text. If your prompt inadvertently cues these patterns, they might appear.\n\n2) Hallucinating Missing Fields:  \n   If a field isn’t clearly present in the input invoice text, the model might fill in a plausible placeholder or guess a typical value.\n\n3) Conflicting Instructions:  \n   If you asked it to be “concise,” but also to “extract all relevant invoice information,” the model may weigh these conflicting signals and produce partial or extra output.\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n5. Strategies to Improve JSON-Only Output\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nAlthough your question focuses on the theoretical underpinnings, it’s useful to note a few practical techniques that stem from these principles:\n\n• Use Strict Role & Format Instructions:  \n  – Provide a system message like:  \n    \"You are an assistant that extracts exact invoice data in JSON format. Include only the keys: invoiceNumber, CIF, total, date, VAT, etc. No additional commentary, disclaimers, or text. Output must be valid JSON, nothing else.\"\n\n• Provide Examples or “Few-Shot” Prompts:  \n  – Demonstrate how an ideal JSON response should look using synthetic data.  \n  – Then provide the real invoice text and repeat: “Follow the same format.”\n\n• Use Function Calling (if available):  \n  – GPT models with function calling can produce strictly structured data by populating defined arguments to a function schema. This significantly reduces unstructured text in the output.\n\n• Validate After Generation:  \n  – Even with careful prompts, you may receive invalid or extraneous JSON. Consider using a validation or post-processing step that checks whether the output is valid JSON and strips out additional text.\n\n• Pre-Process the Invoice:  \n  – If possible, parse your PDF using specialized tools to retrieve each field (e.g., date, invoice number) more reliably, then use GPT only for uncertain or ambiguous sections.\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n6. Deep Model Behaviors & Theoretical Underpinnings\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nAt a deeper theoretical level, the reason the model sometimes injects irrelevant or extra data lies in how it represents language:\n\n• Token-by-Token Generation:\n  – The model has no built-in “understanding” of the difference between “required JSON fields” and “extraneous commentary” beyond your instructions.\n  – During generation, it weighs probabilities based on enormous training corpora that include FAQ-like responses, disclaimers, etc.\n\n• Soft vs. Hard Constraints:\n  – Traditional parsing or rule-based systems impose hard constraints (e.g., \"If the invoice number is not found, print null\").  \n  – Large language models operate with “soft constraints” derived from patterns of text usage. They can be guided to follow a format but aren’t guaranteed to do so unless carefully managed.\n\n• Context and Bias from Training Data:\n  – Models are trained on general web text, which may have “invoice-like” data scattered across many contexts. They generalize from these examples, sometimes leading to guesswork if the invoice text is incomplete or ambiguous.\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n7. Summary of Key Principles\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n1) Generative Probability: LLMs generate text based on probable patterns.  \n2) Semi-Structured Complexity: PDF invoices do not have a standardized structure, causing the model to guess data locations.  \n3) Instruction-Tuning: Models can yield JSON but sometimes deviate due to deeply learned patterns and partial instructions.  \n4) Post-processing & Validation: Often necessary to ensure consistent and strictly formatted output.  \n5) Guidelines vs. Guarantees: While instructions and examples steer the model, they don’t guarantee hallucination-free, perfectly structured data.  \n\nOverall, from a theoretical standpoint, the interplay between a large language model’s training (predictive text generation) and your prompt instructions (human-readable guidelines) underpins both the power (flexible, context-aware extraction) and pitfalls (occasional hallucination, extraneous text) of extracting invoice data from PDFs via ChatGPT or OpenAI’s API.",

          "response": "Below is an explanation that connects high‐level machine learning concepts with the practical aims of extracting structured data (like a JSON with keys for invoice number, CIF, total, dates, VAT, etc.) from unstructured documents (such as PDF invoices):\n\n1. Representation of Text and Its Structure  \n • At the heart of modern NLP models like ChatGPT is “representation learning.” During training on vast text corpora, the model absorbs patterns in language—including recognizable entities and formats—so that it can “understand” how invoices or other documents are typically structured.  \n • The idea is that even though an invoice is a single unstructured blob of text, it often follows common patterns (dates near headers, amounts near totals, etc.). That learned pattern structure allows the model to map parts of the text to semantic labels.\n\n2. The Transformer Architecture  \n • ChatGPT is built on the Transformer architecture, which uses self‐attention mechanisms to weigh the different parts of an input text relative to each other. This capacity means that the model can detect subtle relationships (e.g., associating “invoice no:” with a number that appears shortly after).  \n • The self-attention mechanism inherently supports the extraction of structural and semantic features by “focusing” on the words or fragments that have the highest relevance when attempting to produce a specific output format.\n\n3. Prompt Engineering and In-Context Learning  \n • When you instruct the API to return data strictly as JSON with keys like “invoice_number” or “VAT,” you are leveraging in-context learning. This means the prompt (possibly with examples) guides the model to “realize” that it should organize its response in a formal, structured manner rather than free-form text.  \n • Even without explicit examples, the instructions function as a set of constraints. The model uses its learned knowledge not only to extract data but to synthesize it into the required JSON structure.\n\n4. Probabilistic Generation and the Role of Training Data  \n • The model generates text based on probabilities learned during training. If you see extraneous or slightly off data in the JSON output (or additional commentary), it can be seen as a probabilistic “error” where the model’s generation process includes tokens that it predicts might be helpful.  \n • The underlying statistical language model generates responses that are mixtures of likelihood estimates from its training—if a response diverges from the exact JSON format sometimes, that is because the model is balancing the learned patterns of narrative text (from general training) with your explicit instructions.\n\n5. Information Extraction as a Semantic Task  \n • Fundamentally, what you are asking for is a task in “information extraction” (IE). In classical NLP, this is often approached with techniques such as Named Entity Recognition (NER) and pattern matching.  \n • ChatGPT’s internal “understanding” of the invoice document is a probabilistic blend of many such techniques—where it recognizes entities (numbers, dates, identifying codes) and relational structures. It then presents this recognized information in a structured (JSON) format as directed by the prompt.\n\n6. Limitations and the Gap Between Theory and Practice  \n • Even though the theoretical framework is robust, the practice of constraining outputs to a strict JSON format is not always deterministic. That’s because the model, while highly capable at following instructions, still operates on token probabilities, leading sometimes to “extra” commentary or formatting issues.  \n • This is why prompt refinement (e.g., clearer boundaries in the instructions, providing samples, or reiterating the constraint) is often necessary to ensure the extraction aligns perfectly with your intended output.\n\nIn summary, at a theoretical level, the process of extracting structured data from PDF invoices using ChatGPT involves:  \n • Learning and recognizing document structure from huge amounts of text (representation learning),  \n • Using the transformer’s self-attention to correlate parts of the text with semantic roles,  \n • Leveraging prompt engineering to guide the model towards a specific output format (structured JSON), and  \n • Navigating the probabilistic nature of language generation which sometimes introduces variance in the strictly desired format.\n\nThese principles form the bridge between how a model “understands” an input that looks like an invoice and then produces output that is a JSON representation of that information—even if occasional adjustments to the prompt or post-processing might be needed to get perfect results.",

Here are the fundamental principles and issues at play:\n\n## Core Technical Challenges:\n\n### 1. **PDF Processing Limitations**\n- PDFs aren't natively structured data - they're essentially positioned text/graphics\n- OCR quality varies with scan quality, fonts, and formatting\n- Table structures and layouts can be ambiguous to parse\n\n### 2. **LLM Hallucination Tendencies**\n- LLMs are trained to be helpful and complete responses\n- When uncertain, they may interpolate or \"fill in\" missing data\n- Pattern matching from training data can override actual document content\n\n### 3. **Context Window and Attention Issues**\n- Long documents may exceed optimal processing length\n- Important details might be missed due to attention mechanism limitations\n- The model might blend information from different parts of the document\n\n## Best Practices to Minimize Issues:\n\n### 1. **Preprocessing**\n```python\n# Better: Extract text first, verify quality\npdf_text = extract_text_from_pdf(pdf_file)\nif verify_text_quality(pdf_text):\n    result = process_with_gpt(pdf_text)\n```\n\n### 2. **Prompt Engineering**\n```python\nprompt = \"\"\"\nExtract ONLY the following data from this invoice.\nIf any field is not found, return null - DO NOT guess or infer values.\n\nRequired fields:\n- invoice_number: (exact value from document)\n- date: (format: YYYY-MM-DD)\n- total: (numeric only)\n- vat: (numeric only)\n\nReturn ONLY JSON, no explanations.\n\"\"\"\n```\n\n### 3. **Validation Layer**\n```python\ndef validate_extraction(extracted_data, original_text):\n    # Verify each extracted value exists in original\n    for key, value in extracted_data.items():\n        if value and str(value) not in original_text:\n            flag_as_potential_hallucination(key, value)\n```\n\n### 4. **Multi-Step Approach**\n- First pass: Extract all text\n- Second pass: Identify specific sections\n- Third pass: Extract individual fields with focused prompts\n\nWould you like me to elaborate on any of these aspects or help troubleshoot your specific issue?",

          "response": "It looks like your message got cut off, but I understand you’re using OpenAI’s API (and ChatGPT web) to extract structured data from PDF invoices (like invoice number, CIF, total, dates, VAT, etc.), and you're encountering an issue where the JSON output contains data that... (the message stops here).\n\nFrom your description, I’ll address common issues and best practices when extracting data from PDF invoices using ChatGPT or OpenAI’s API:\n\n**Common Issues and Solutions:**\n\n1. **PDF Parsing Quality:**  \n   ChatGPT (and the API) can only process text. If you upload a PDF, the service will attempt to extract text from the PDF, but this process isn’t always perfect—especially with scanned PDFs, complex layouts, or non-standard fonts. This can lead to missing, jumbled, or incorrect data in the parsed text, which in turn causes the AI to misinterpret or miss key fields.\n\n   **Solution:**  \n   - Use OCR tools (like Tesseract or Adobe Acrobat) to ensure the text is accurately extracted before feeding it to ChatGPT.\n   - Preprocess the PDF and extract the text yourself, then send only the relevant text to ChatGPT for structured data extraction.\n\n2. **Prompt Clarity and Constraints:**  \n   If you don’t specify strict output constraints, ChatGPT might add explanations, context, or extra data.\n\n   **Solution:**  \n   - Use a very explicit prompt, for example:  \n     ```\n     Extract only the following information from the invoice text below and output strictly in JSON format (no explanations or extra text): invoice_number, CIF, total, invoice_date, VAT. If a field is missing, use null.\n     [PASTE INVOICE TEXT HERE]\n     ```\n   - If using the API, set up system and user roles to reinforce this, e.g.,  \n     ```json\n     [\n       {\"role\": \"system\", \"content\": \"You are a data extraction assistant. Always output only valid JSON with the specified keys and never include any explanations.\"},\n       {\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"Extract the following fields as JSON: ...\"}\n     ]\n     ```\n\n3. **Data Hallucination or Fabrication:**  \n   If the model can’t find a field, it might guess or invent data.\n\n   **Solution:**  \n   - Instruct the model to use null or \"\" for missing fields, and not to guess.\n   - Example prompt:  \n     ```\n     If a field is not present or cannot be found, set its value to null.\n     ```\n\n4. **Structured Output Parsing:**  \n   Even with clear prompts, sometimes the output isn’t valid JSON or contains extra text.\n\n   **Solution:**  \n   - Use functions like OpenAI’s function calling (if using GPT-4 API) to enforce JSON schema.\n   - Post-process the model’s output with a JSON parser—discard anything that isn’t valid JSON.\n\n**In summary:**\n\n- Extract text from the PDF yourself if possible.\n- Use strict prompts to demand only a JSON output.\n- Specify what to do with missing or ambiguous fields.\n- Consider using the function calling API for guaranteed structure.\n\n**Example Prompt:**\n\n```\nGiven the following invoice text, extract these fields: invoice_number, CIF, total, invoice_date, VAT. Only output a JSON object with those keys, using null if a field is missing. Do not include any other text.\n\nInvoice text:\n[PASTE HERE]\n```\n\nIf you share the specific issues you're seeing in the JSON output (for example: extra data, hallucinated values, explanations included, etc.), I can give even more targeted advice!",

          "success": false,
          "response": "Below are some considerations and best practices for extracting JSON-only data from PDF invoices using ChatGPT (or the OpenAI API), ensuring minimal hallucination and strictly structured outputs.\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n1. Provide text, not just the PDF\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n• ChatGPT cannot directly open or parse the PDF file in its raw format. If you upload a PDF via ChatGPT web or the OpenAI API, you’ll first need to extract the textual content (e.g., via OCR or other PDF parsing tools).  \n• Once you have the invoice text, you can feed that text into ChatGPT so it has direct access to the invoice details.\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n2. Use very explicit instructions and formatting\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nWhen prompting ChatGPT, include explicit instructions on the output format. For example:\n\n\"You are given the following text from an invoice. Extract the following fields:  \n- invoice_number  \n- cif  \n- issue_date  \n- total  \n- vat  \n- etc.\n\nReturn ONLY valid JSON. DO NOT include any additional information or text. The JSON schema should look like:\n\n{\n  \"invoice_number\": \"<string>\",\n  \"cif\": \"<string>\",\n  \"issue_date\": \"<YYYY-MM-DD>\",\n  \"total\": <number>,\n  \"vat\": <number>\n}\n\nAnalyze the text below and provide your output:\n\n<<<INVOICE_TEXT_START>>>\n[Paste your invoice text here]\n<<<INVOICE_TEXT_END>>>\"\n\nBy making the instructions crystal-clear (“Return ONLY valid JSON,” “DO NOT include any additional text,” etc.), you reduce the risk of ChatGPT providing extra explanations or disclaimers.\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n3. Use system messages (if possible)\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nIf you have access to system and user messages (for example, using OpenAI’s ChatCompletion API), place your formatting requirements into the system message so ChatGPT consistently follows them. For example:\n\nSystem message:\n\"You are an invoice data extraction assistant. You will be provided with invoice text and you will extract specific fields. Your response must only include valid JSON. No additional commentary.\"\n\nThen, in the user message:\n\"Here is the invoice text: [provide text]. Extract the following fields and output in JSON: invoice_number, cif, issue_date, total, vat.\"\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n4. Validate the JSON output\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nIt’s often helpful to programmatically validate ChatGPT’s output before using it, especially if you notice ChatGPT sometimes adds disclaimers or additional text. In your application code, you can do something along these lines:\n\n1. Send the prompt with explicit JSON-only instructions.  \n2. Receive the string output from the API.  \n3. Use a JSON parser in your programming language to check for validity (e.g., Python’s json.loads).  \n4. If the parser fails (improper JSON) or the JSON is incomplete, you can re-prompt or discard the output.\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n5. Consider “temperature” and “top_p” settings\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nWhen using the OpenAI API, setting temperature to 0.0 can reduce creative/hallucinatory responses. For example:\n\n{\n  \"model\": \"gpt-3.5-turbo\",\n  \"temperature\": 0.0,\n  \"messages\": [...]\n}\n\nThis low “temperature” instructs the model to be more deterministic and stick closer to the exact instructions, making it less likely to include extra commentary.\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n6. Example prompt for the API\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nBelow is a distilled example of how you might structure your request to the ChatCompletion API. Adjust it as needed:\n\nPOST https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions\n\nHeaders:\n  Content-Type: application/json\n  Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY\n\nBody (JSON):\n{\n  \"model\": \"gpt-3.5-turbo\",\n  \"temperature\": 0,\n  \"messages\": [\n    {\n      \"role\": \"system\",\n      \"content\": \"You are an invoice extraction system. Extract invoice data accurately and output in JSON only. No extra text or commentary.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"role\": \"user\",\n      \"content\": \"Extract the following information from the invoice text: invoice_number, cif, issue_date, total, and vat. The invoice text is:\\n\\n\\\"Invoice number: ABC123\\nCIF: 111222333X\\nDate: 2023-09-01\\nTotal: €400.00\\nVAT: €50.00\\n...\\\"\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n\nThe model’s reply should look like:\n\n{\n  \"invoice_number\": \"ABC123\",\n  \"cif\": \"111222333X\",\n  \"issue_date\": \"2023-09-01\",\n  \"total\": 400.00,\n  \"vat\": 50.00\n}\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n7. Troubleshooting if extra text appears\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n• Reinforce your instructions and ensure the entire conversation context is consistent. Remove or minimize earlier messages that might cause ChatGPT to “explain” or “justify” output.  \n• Include a final reminder at the end of the user/system prompt stating “Return ONLY the JSON object. Do not include any additional narrative.”  \n• If ChatGPT still adds disclaimers or formatting around the JSON, you can either parse and ignore anything outside the JSON object or reprompt the model with a more forceful or clarifying instruction.\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n\nBy following these best practices—particularly giving ChatGPT clear instructions, constraining the output to JSON, and using systematic validation—you’ll minimize extra text or unintended “hallucinations” and more reliably retrieve the structured data (invoice number, CIF, dates, totals, VAT, etc.) in JSON format.",

The Scenario and the Problem\n\n• You’re using the OpenAI API (or ChatGPT web) to process real PDF invoices.  \n• Your prompt tells the model to extract specific data (invoice number, CIF, total, dates, VAT, etc.) and to output only a JSON object with those keys.  \n• In practice, when you provide a real invoice as input, the model sometimes returns extra text (or additional keys/analysis) rather than strictly the JSON you expect.\n\n2. Why It Happens\n\n• ChatGPT is a language model that is designed to “explain” or “analyze” context. Even if you ask for only JSON output, the model sometimes adds context or commentary that might be useful for a human reader—such as explanations or decision-making hints based on the data.  \n• In tabletop exercises, this behavior may cause confusion if the practical requirement is strict machine-readability (i.e., a pure JSON response).\n\n3. How to Tackle the Issue\n\n• Be Explicit: In your prompt, clearly state that you require “output strictly in JSON format with no additional text.” For example, add instructions like, “Respond only with valid JSON. Do not include any other commentary or text outside of the JSON.”  \n• Provide a JSON Schema: Outline exactly which keys you expect. For example:  \n {\n  \"invoice_number\": \"string\",\n  \"cif\": \"string\",\n  \"total\": \"number\",\n  \"date\": \"string\",\n  \"vat\": \"number\"\n }\nThis reduces ambiguity and can help steer the model’s output.  \n• Use a System Message (if possible): When employing the API, you can include a system message (or a developer prompt) instructing the model to “limit output strictly to valid JSON (with no markdown formatting or additional commentary).”  \n• Temperature and Model Settings: Setting a lower temperature (closer to 0) can help minimize creativity in the output and keep the response more focused on the task.  \n• Post-Processing: In an automated workflow, you can run a JSON parser on the response and reject or flag outputs that include any stray text or exceed a strict schema. This way you can catch extra output and retry if necessary.\n\n4. In a Tabletop Exercise\n\n• Explain that even though the model “knows” how to generate helpful text to allow humans to make informed decisions, the goal here is to have an output that is predictable and machine readable.  \n• Discuss how refining the prompt and configuring the settings (such as less creative randomness) can lead to more consistent outputs.  \n• Emphasize that building robust pipelines sometimes means introducing a check (or a “post-processing” step) to ensure that even if extra text is returned, your system extracts only the JSON that meets the required schema.\n\nBy following those steps, participants can understand both the “why” behind the model’s behavior and the “how” they can adjust input instructions to get the desired machine-friendly JSON response from real PDF invoices.",

          "response": "It seems your message got cut off at the end. However, based on what you've described, you're encountering an issue when using OpenAI's API or ChatGPT web interface to extract structured data (such as invoice number, CIF, dates, VAT amounts, totals, etc.) from PDF invoice documents. Specifically, you mentioned the following scenario:\n\n**Problem Summary:**\nYou upload a PDF invoice and request ChatGPT to return structured data as JSON with specific keys. However, ChatGPT sometimes includes additional, unintended information, or does not strictly adhere to the requested JSON formatting and data constraints. This results in data inaccuracies, irrelevant content, or information that is not strictly aligned with the JSON structure you want.\n\n**Common Reasons for This Issue:**\n1. **Prompt Ambiguity:**  \n   If the prompt isn't precise enough, ChatGPT might interpret it broadly and include additional content that's irrelevant or unstructured.\n   \n2. **Data Complexity and Contextual Guessing:**  \n   LLMs like ChatGPT sometimes \"fill in the gaps\" if the data extracted from the PDF itself is unclear, incomplete, or ambiguous.\n   \n3. **Model Limitations in Handling PDFs:**  \n   Currently, ChatGPT doesn't directly parse PDFs. Usually, the content from PDFs must first be converted (using OCR or text extraction methods) into plain text before being passed into the API. If this pre-processing step is not done clearly, the input text might contain noisy or extraneous information that ChatGPT may pick up and include in the JSON output.\n\n4. **Prompt Engineering Issues:**  \n   Without clear instructions, ChatGPT may not strictly follow a JSON-only format or may misunderstand what information is required.\n\n**Recommended Solutions:**\n\n1. **Improve Prompt Clarity and Specificity:**\n   - Clearly specify the exact JSON keys you require and explicitly instruct the model not to include any additional information or explanation.\n   - Example prompt:\n   ```\n   Extract the following fields from the invoice text below and respond strictly in JSON format with only these keys: \"invoice_number\", \"CIF\", \"invoice_date\", \"due_date\", \"subtotal\", \"VAT_rate\", \"VAT_amount\", \"total_amount\". Do not include fields that are missing or unclear, and do not provide any explanations or additional text beyond the JSON output:\n   \n   [Invoice Text Here]\n   ```\n\n2. **Pre-process PDF Data:**\n   - Before sending data to ChatGPT, clearly extract text using reliable PDF-to-text extraction tools (e.g., PyMuPDF, pdfplumber, Tesseract OCR, or Adobe Acrobat).  \n   - Ensure extracted text is clean and accurately reflects the document, without unnecessary headers, footers, or metadata that might confuse ChatGPT.\n\n3. **Use Function Calling (API Feature):**\n   - If you're using OpenAI's API, consider using the **function calling** feature (available with GPT-3.5 Turbo and GPT-4 API) to strictly enforce structured JSON responses.  \n   - This feature helps ensure the model's response conforms strictly to the defined schema you set, preventing unintended content from being included.\n\n   **Example function calling schema:**\n   ```json\n   {\n     \"name\": \"extract_invoice_data\",\n     \"description\": \"Extracts structured invoice data from invoice text.\",\n     \"parameters\": {\n       \"type\": \"object\",\n       \"properties\": {\n         \"invoice_number\": {\"type\": \"string\"},\n         \"CIF\": {\"type\": \"string\"},\n         \"invoice_date\": {\"type\": \"string\", \"format\": \"date\"},\n         \"due_date\": {\"type\": \"string\", \"format\": \"date\"},\n         \"subtotal\": {\"type\": \"number\"},\n         \"VAT_rate\": {\"type\": \"number\"},\n         \"VAT_amount\": {\"type\": \"number\"},\n         \"total_amount\": {\"type\": \"number\"}\n       },\n       \"required\": [\"invoice_number\", \"CIF\", \"invoice_date\", \"total_amount\"]\n     }\n   }\n   ```\n\n4. **Post-processing and Validation:**\n   - After ChatGPT returns the JSON, validate and sanitize the data programmatically to ensure completeness and correctness.\n   - Implement simple validation rules (like date format checking, numeric validations, and mandatory fields verification).\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe most robust solution is to:  \n- Clearly define structured prompts,  \n- Utilize function-calling capabilities provided by OpenAI,  \n- Ensure PDF pre-processing is accurate, and  \n- Implement validation steps after extraction.\n\nFeel free to clarify your exact scenario further or provide examples if you need more tailored advice!",

OCR errors or formatting issues can cause missing or misread data, which ChatGPT then tries to \"fill in\" with plausible values or generic placeholders.\n\n3. **Lack of Ground Truth**\n   - If ChatGPT can’t confidently find a value for a key (e.g., VAT number missing), it sometimes fabricates one or supplies a placeholder (e.g., \"12345678X\") based on patterns from its training data.\n\n4. **Prompt Engineering Matters**\n   - The clarity and strictness of your prompt heavily influence the output format. Vague or open-ended prompts lead to less predictable, more verbose, or less structured responses.\n\n5. **Model Limitations with Documents**\n   - ChatGPT isn’t natively optimized for parsing PDFs as documents. It can process text, but without specialized document understanding, it may miss context or structure, leading to inaccurate or generic data extraction.\n\n**How to Improve Results:**\n\n- Use very precise prompts, e.g.,  \n  > Extract only the following fields from the invoice, and output strictly valid JSON with keys: invoice_number, cif, total, date, vat. Do not add any commentary or explanation.  \n- Consider using specialized tools (like OpenAI’s document models, or third-party PDF-to-JSON extraction libraries) before passing text to ChatGPT.\n- Double-check extracted text for OCR or formatting errors before feeding it to the model.\n- If using the API, set response format to JSON if possible, or use function calling for stricter outputs.\n\n**Summary Table:**\n\n| Dynamic                                    | Effect on Output                                        |\n|---------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|\n| Completion bias                            | Adds extra info or guesses missing data                 |\n| PDF/text extraction errors                  | Leads to incorrect/missing fields, more guessing        |\n| Incomplete prompt                          | Causes verbose or non-JSON output                       |\n| Model’s lack of document understanding      | Misses structured fields, leading to filler content      |\n\n**In conclusion:**  \nThe dynamics are a mix of language model completion tendencies, prompt specificity, PDF-to-text extraction quality, and the model’s lack of document structure awareness.

          "response": "It sounds like you are running into a common side effect of using ChatGPT (or other large language models) for structured data extraction. Below are some of the factors (“the dynamics”) that cause ChatGPT to generate “extra” or unexpected information instead of focusing strictly on the JSON fields you want:\n\n1. Generative Nature of the Model  \n   • ChatGPT is fundamentally a text-generating model. When it reads your prompt—including the PDF’s text—its default behavior is to continue a conversation, fill in gaps, and provide “helpful” context. This can mean ChatGPT volunteers extra commentary or additional fields.  \n   • If your target PDF text is incomplete or ambiguous, ChatGPT may “hallucinate” (fabricate) certain values to fill what it perceives as missing information.\n\n2. Instruction Scope and Prompt Clarity  \n   • By default, ChatGPT’s “creative” side tries to be helpful. Even if you only want JSON, it might prepend explanations, disclaimers, or general text.  \n   • You can reduce unwanted text by giving explicit instructions in your prompt, for example:  \n     “Only output valid JSON. Do not include any additional commentary.”  \n   • In some cases, you may need to remind the model multiple times or use more precise system and user instructions in the API to avoid extra text.\n\n3. Reliance on Extracted/OCR Text  \n   • ChatGPT alone does not automatically run OCR. If you upload a PDF to ChatGPT (e.g., via ChatGPT+ “Upload file” feature or a plugin), that PDF is typically converted to text behind the scenes.  \n   • If the PDF text is messy, includes artifacts, or has formatting irregularities, ChatGPT might misread or guess at data. Ensure that the text extraction step (whether it is PDF to text or OCR) provides clean, structured text.\n\n4. Context-Window and Summarization Effects  \n   • If your PDF is lengthy or has a lot of nearby text, ChatGPT might mix invoice fields with irrelevant lines from the document (like disclaimers, addresses in the footer, etc.).  \n   • The model sometimes tries to be thorough and includes extra details it detects—like shipping addresses, terms, or disclaimers—unless you specify “Strictly include these fields: [list].”\n\n5. API vs. ChatGPT Web Interface Differences  \n   • Using the OpenAI API with specialized parameters (temperature, top_p, etc.) can reduce the extra text. Lower temperature values (e.g., 0 to 0.2) make the model’s output more deterministic and more likely to stick to your requested format.  \n   • In the ChatGPT web interface, the model might be more prone to “chatty” behavior. Setting a clear system message (if you have access to that feature) can nudge ChatGPT to speak in JSON only.\n\nHOW TO MINIMIZE EXTRA TEXT OR “LIFE COMMENTARY”  \n• Use a System Prompt (API) or Initial ChatGPT Message (Web) that states:  \n  “You are an assistant designed to extract structured data from invoices.  \n   When you receive an invoice’s text, output only valid JSON with the keys [X, Y, Z].  \n   No additional text or commentary.”  \n• Specify the exact JSON schema and ask ChatGPT to fill it in.  \n• Use temperature=0 in the API to minimize creative elaborations.  \n• Include a reminder at the end of your user prompt: “Output only JSON, with no added commentary.”\n\nIn short, the “normal part of life” text appears because ChatGPT is designed to be conversational and helpful by default. By refining the prompt and ensuring you have a clear system/user instruction hierarchy, you can usually get ChatGPT to provide strictly the JSON data fields you need.",

          "response": "There are several intertwined factors at play when you encounter output that mixes your requested JSON with “normal‐life” or extra textual data. Here are some of the dynamics:\n\n1. Processing mixture of task instructions and source data:\n • When you upload a PDF invoice, the model first “reads” the entire document. Invoices often come with a mix of strictly structured fields (invoice number, CIF, total, VAT, dates, etc.) and surrounding narrative or formatting content.\n • Even if you instruct the model to extract only the JSON keys you care about, the model’s internal processing may “see” the extra text as part of the overall context. This can lead it to include language that it perceives as clarifying or contextual—in part because it’s trying to be helpful.\n\n2. The influence of conversational training:\n • ChatGPT (and similar models) has been trained on large amounts of conversational data. As a result, its outputs are “built” for being engaging and detailed. This sometimes means that, unless very strictly constrained, it might add commentary, explanations, or extra verbiage.\n • Even if the instructions say “only output JSON”, if the model’s understanding of the task is not perfectly aligned with that directive (or if the PDF content is complex), those extra parts can slip in.\n\n3. Ambiguity in instructions versus the richness of the PDF content:\n • When you ask, “Extract these keys as JSON,” if the model finds that the source text doesn’t map one‐to‐one with your expected keys or has additional textual nuances, it may “generalize” by including what it deems part of the invoice’s “life” information.\n • The real-world invoices might include contextual details (like company notes, terms, or small print) that the model considers normal language rather than strict data entries.\n\n4. Balancing fidelity and reasoning (“chain‐of‐thought”):\n • Although ChatGPT internally reasons using its hidden chain-of-thought, sometimes parts of that reasoning can influence the final message format if not perfectly suppressed. Even when asking for a pure JSON output, remnants of the model’s natural language inclinations can appear.\n • This behavior reflects a balance between following a rigorous extraction routine and the model’s built-in tendency to provide context, falsifiable commentary, or safety checks.\n\n5. API versus ChatGPT web behavior and prompt engineering nuances:\n • When using the API, the exact behavior can depend on the precise prompt (including system instructions) you set. A prompt that is not extremely explicit may allow more room for natural language responses.\n • In the ChatGPT web interface, where underlying system instructions and user context are layered, the model might “default” to a more verbose reply unless explicitly told otherwise.\n\nIn summary, what you’re seeing is the result of a model that’s optimized for conversational helpfulness and that interprets the uploaded PDF not only as a data source but as a piece of human-generated text with depth. To get a strictly JSON-like output, you’d likely need to make the instruction extremely explicit—perhaps even providing examples—and ensure that the model’s prompt emphasizes “no extra text, only valid JSON” at every level. This interplay between natural language understanding, extraction of structured data, and the model’s tendency to “explain” things is at the heart of the dynamics you’re observing.",

          "response": "Here is what's likely happening, explained step-by-step:\n\n### 1. **Contextual Understanding and Predictive Nature of GPT:**\nChatGPT (and OpenAI's GPT models, in general) are large language models trained to predict plausible continuations based on patterns learned from vast amounts of text data. Internally, the model doesn't inherently \"understand\" invoices as structured documents; instead, it recognizes patterns learned during training from countless text examples (websites, books, articles, etc.).\n\n### 2. **Lack of True PDF Parsing Capability:**\nIf you're directly pasting PDF invoice content into ChatGPT, the model is not truly parsing the PDF. Instead, it is treating all input as text. It doesn't have built-in PDF parsing functionality (like OCR or structured data extraction). It simply attempts to interpret the textual input based on learned patterns.\n\n### 3. **Model Hallucination of Plausible but Incorrect Data:**\nThe model tries to fulfill your request for specific keys (invoice number, CIF, total, dates, VAT, etc.), but when the PDF text is unclear, incomplete, or not fully extracted, the model may \"hallucinate\": it generates plausible values based on previously learned patterns. This is why the extracted data sometimes seems realistic—but it might not match your actual invoice.\n\n### 4. **Ambiguity and Insufficient Input Data:**\nIf your PDF text extraction (through copy-paste or OCR) is incomplete, noisy, or ambiguous, the model fills gaps with plausible answers based on its internal knowledge. For example, if you ask explicitly for invoice data, the model might generate plausible-looking invoice numbers, VAT percentages, or dates, even though this data might not be explicitly present in the provided content.\n\n### 5. **Dynamics (Why Is This Happening?):**\n- GPT models rely on probabilistic pattern matching, not structured database retrieval.\n- When explicitly tasked with extracting structured data (like JSON), GPT tries to infer and predict missing elements to fulfill your request.\n- If the provided input is unclear, incomplete, or unstructured, GPT fills these gaps with plausible but fictitious information.\n\n### 6. **Best Practices to Avoid This Problem:**\n- **Pre-process your invoices**: Use dedicated OCR and PDF parsing tools to convert PDF to clean, structured text before providing it to the API.\n- **Prompt Engineering**: Clearly instruct GPT to return only data explicitly found in the provided text, and explicitly instruct it to return \"N/A\" or \"null\" when data isn't present.\n- **Use a two-step process**: First, use specialized tools to extract the raw text clearly (e.g., OCR, PDF parsing libraries). Secondly, send the cleaned, structured text clearly labeled to GPT for final refinement and extraction.\n\n**Example Prompt Improvement:**\n```\nExtract only explicitly available data from the text below. If a value is not explicitly present, return \"null\".\nReturn only a valid JSON object with these keys: invoice_number, CIF, total_amount, date_issue, date_due, VAT_amount.\nText:\n[Paste cleaned and structured invoice text here]\n```\n\n---\n\nIn short, the dynamics you're experiencing are due to GPT's predictive nature, lack of explicit PDF parsing, ambiguity of input data, and the model's tendency to generate plausible outputs in the face of uncertainty.",

This can limit their ability to accurately and consistently extract the specific data points you're looking for.\n\n2. **PDF Structure and Layout**: PDF documents can have varying layouts, formats, and structures, which can make it challenging for language models to reliably locate and extract the desired information. The models may struggle to understand the context and semantics of the content within the PDF.\n\n3. **Unstructured Data**: Invoices often contain a mix of structured and unstructured data, such as tables, headers, footers, and free-form text. Language models may have difficulty distinguishing the relevant data points from the surrounding context.\n\n4. **Inconsistent Formatting**: Invoices from different organizations or even within the same organization can have varying formatting, which can further complicate the extraction process for language models.\n\n5. **Ambiguity and Context**: Language models may face challenges in resolving ambiguities and understanding the contextual meaning of certain terms or data points within the invoice.\n\nTo address these challenges, you may need to explore more specialized approaches or tools designed for extracting data from PDF documents, such as:\n\n1. **Rule-based Extraction**: Developing custom rules and heuristics to identify and extract the specific data points you need from the PDF invoices.\n\n2. **Machine Learning-based Extraction**: Exploring machine learning models trained on a large dataset of labeled invoice PDFs to learn the patterns and structures necessary for accurate data extraction.\n\n3. **Hybrid Approaches**: Combining language models like ChatGPT with other techniques, such as computer vision or rule-based methods, to leverage the strengths of different approaches.\n\n4. **Specialized PDF Processing Libraries**: Utilizing libraries and tools designed specifically for PDF processing and data extraction, such as Tabula, Camelot, or Pdfplumber, which may provide more robust and reliable results.\n\nIt's important to note that the performance and accuracy of these approaches will depend on the quality and diversity of the training data, the complexity of the invoice structures, and the specific requirements of your use case.

When you’re researching how ChatGPT (or other LLMs) handle invoice extraction from PDFs and you notice unexpected data in the JSON output, here are the key aspects to investigate for your documentary:\n\n### 1. **PDF Parsing and Text Extraction**\n- **How is the PDF converted to text?**  \n  LLMs cannot “see” PDFs directly. They rely on backend preprocessing to convert PDFs (which may have tables, images, or scanned text) into plain text or structured data. Errors or artifacts can arise here.\n- **OCR Limitations:**  \n  For scanned or image-based invoices, OCR (Optical Character Recognition) is used, which can introduce misreads or noise in the text.\n\n### 2. **Prompt Engineering & Output Control**\n- **Prompt Specificity:**  \n  How detailed and restrictive is your prompt? Overly broad prompts may cause the model to “hallucinate” or add extra information.\n- **Output Format Enforcement:**  \n  LLMs are probabilistic and may not always stick strictly to the requested JSON schema, especially for complex or ambiguous documents.\n\n### 3. **Model Limitations**\n- **Hallucination:**  \n  LLMs sometimes fabricate data if fields are missing or unclear in the input.\n- **Context Handling:**  \n  If the invoice is long or complex, the model may miss or misinterpret key data, especially if the relevant fields are in unusual places.\n- **Generalization:**  \n  The model may try to “fill in” typical values for invoices if it can’t find them, leading to invented or irrelevant data.\n\n### 4. **Invoice Diversity**\n- **Template Variation:**  \n  Invoices come in many formats, layouts, and languages. Models trained on generic data may struggle with uncommon or complex invoice templates.\n- **Field Ambiguity:**  \n  Some fields (e.g., “total” vs “subtotal” or “VAT” vs “IVA”) may appear in multiple places or under different names.\n\n### 5. **API and Platform Differences**\n- **ChatGPT Web vs API:**  \n  There may be differences in how the web interface and the API handle file uploads, parsing, and context management.\n- **File Size and Truncation:**  \n  Large files may be truncated, leading to missing fields.\n\n### 6. **Security and Privacy**\n- **Sensitive Data Handling:**  \n  How is personal or financial data in invoices handled, anonymized, or stored? This is especially relevant for documentary research.\n\n### 7. **Post-Processing and Validation**\n- **Error Correction:**  \n  Are there post-processing steps to validate or correct the JSON output? What happens if fields are missing or have invalid values?\n\n---\n\n## **For Your Documentary: Key Questions to Explore**\n- How does OpenAI process PDF files before presenting them to the language model?\n- What are the common sources of error or “hallucinated” data in invoice extraction?\n- How do users and developers mitigate data extraction errors? (e.g., prompt tuning, using external validation, combining with rule-based tools)\n- What are the real-world implications when LLMs misinterpret or invent invoice data?\n- How do different invoice formats or languages affect extraction quality?\n- What are the ethical and privacy considerations when processing sensitive financial documents with AI?\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nInvestigate the full pipeline, from PDF parsing/OCR to prompt design, model behavior, and post-processing. Pay special attention to failure cases, hallucination, and how the model deals with ambiguity or missing fields.\n\nIf you want, I can help you design some experiments or interview questions for your documentary!",

          "response": "Below are several key aspects you might want to investigate when exploring how to extract invoice data (e.g., invoice number, CIF, totals, dates, VAT) from PDF files using OpenAI’s models:\n\n1) Precision and Hallucination  \n   • Hallucinated Data: OpenAI’s language models can sometimes output data that doesn’t actually appear in the text. Investigate when and why the model confabulates numbers or fields.  \n   • Partial Understanding: The model may partially parse text, leading to errors if the document layout is especially complex. Look for patterns—are mistakes showing up in totals, dates, or fields that appear in unusual positions on the invoice?  \n\n2) Prompt Engineering Techniques  \n   • Clear Instructions: Consistently remind the model, in your prompt, that it should only extract existing data and refrain from guessing. Consider including a statement such as “If something is not present, output null.”  \n   • Format Enforcement: Ask explicitly for a JSON structure with predefined keys. Consider using a short “template” example to show the precise format.  \n   • Chain-of-Thought or Step-by-Step Parsing: Some approaches might have the model outline its steps before producing the final JSON. However, if you want strictly JSON output, you may need to filter out the chain-of-thought.  \n\n3) Handling PDF Content  \n   • Text Extraction vs. Image Scans: Investigate whether your PDFs are true text-based PDFs or image scans. If they’re scanned images, choose a reliable OCR process before sending the text to the model.  \n   • Layout Complexity: Complex layouts, multiple columns, tables, or unusual invoice formats can lead to parsing errors. Clarify in your prompt how to handle data that might span multiple lines or columns.  \n   • Pre-processing and Cleanup: Consider cleaning the extracted text (removing extraneous line breaks or artifacts) before feeding it to the model.  \n\n4) Consistency and Validation  \n   • Post-processing Validation: Implement checks for common data formats (dates, invoice numbers, etc.) to catch or correct incorrect outputs. For example, a typical VAT number or CIF might follow a known pattern, or total amounts might need to match item subtotals plus tax.  \n   • Iterative Refinement: If an expected field is missing or has an obviously incorrect format, re-run the prompt or add clarifications to your prompt to fix mistakes.  \n\n5) Data Privacy and Compliance  \n   • Sensitive Data Handling: Invoices can contain personal or sensitive company data. Review data privacy implications if uploading these documents to any third-party API.  \n   • Token Limits and Secure Submission: If using an API, you must remain aware of token usage and ensure you don’t send excessive private information. Consider summarizing or limiting what you send to only necessary fields.  \n\n6) Automation vs. Manual Oversight  \n   • Human-in-the-Loop: For critical invoice processing, you might maintain a human review step, especially if the output is used for financial or regulatory compliance.  \n   • Confidence Scoring: Although the OpenAI API doesn’t provide direct confidence scores, you can build a heuristic or consistency checks to label uncertain results, flagging them for review.  \n\n7) Tooling and Alternatives  \n   • Specialized Tools: Compare results from language models to other OCR or PDF parsing libraries (e.g., Tesseract with a post-processing script, or commercial solutions).  \n   • Hybrid Approaches: Use a standard PDF-to-text extraction tool or library to reliably get the raw text, then prompt GPT with the text. This can be easier to debug than feeding entire PDFs directly (especially if they are binary or image-based).  \n\n8) Prompt and Model Versions  \n   • Model Capabilities: The performance might vary across models (e.g., GPT-3.5 vs. GPT-4). It may be beneficial to compare them on specific invoice examples.  \n   • Prompt Size and Complexity: Longer prompts or more complex instructions can affect performance and costs. Balance clarity with conciseness.  \n\nInvestigating these points will help uncover why ChatGPT might produce data that does not exist (hallucinations) or omit the correct details. You’ll also learn how to fine-tune your prompt and potential workflows to achieve higher accuracy and reliability in extracting structured data from invoices.",

Input quality and pre‐processing:\n  • How is the PDF being converted into text before it’s sent to the model? PDF files (especially invoices) often have complex layouts. Check whether the extraction tool is preserving the intended structure or if the text is garbled or missing context.\n  • If images or scanned sections are involved, determine whether OCR (optical character recognition) is being applied accurately.\n\n2. Prompt clarity and specificity:\n  • Ensure that your prompt clearly defines the expected keys (such as \"invoice number\", \"CIF\", \"total\", \"dates\", \"VAT\", etc.) and strict JSON format. If the instructions are ambiguous, the model may fill in additional keys or structure data differently.\n  • Consider providing an example output or using “few-shot” prompting to demonstrate exactly how you want the JSON formatted.\n\n3. Model limitations and behaviors:\n  • ChatGPT may sometimes “hallucinate” details or add extra context, especially if the text is ambiguous. Investigate whether the model is inferring data that isn’t explicitly in the PDF.\n  • Explore the behavior differences between the ChatGPT web interface and the API, as there can be differences in how strictly instructions are followed.\n\n4. Token limits and context management:\n  • Determine if the invoice text is too long or if it exceeds token limits, which might lead to incomplete or summarized outputs.\n  • Ensure that the context window is managed in a way the model can access all necessary details before generating the structured JSON.\n\n5. Handling of edge cases:\n  • Check if variations in invoice layouts or unexpected data formats cause the model to misinterpret or rearrange the JSON structure.\n  • Look into how the model handles missing fields or variations in terminology (for instance, “CIF” vs. “VAT ID”).\n\n6. Post-process validation:\n  • Consider adding a validation step to enforce strict JSON formatting after the model returns its answer. This can help you catch deviations and prompt either for clarification or reformatting.\n\nBy systematically examining these areas—how the PDF data is pre-processed, the clarity of your prompts, inherent model behaviors, context limitations, handling of varying invoice layouts, and post-processing checks—you can pinpoint where the discrepancy originates and then adjust your approach accordingly for better extraction results.",

Check whether the PDF text extraction step provides a clean, structured output.\n\n### 2. **Prompt Engineering and Clarity**\n- **Prompt specificity:** Ensure your prompt explicitly defines all required fields, clearly instructing ChatGPT to return data strictly in a JSON structure.\n- **Consistent formatting:** Clearly specify the format, such as dates (e.g., ISO 8601), numeric formats, decimal separators, and currency symbols.\n\n### 3. **Context-Length and Token Limitation**\n- **Exceeding token limits:** Verify whether the PDF text extraction produces content exceeding ChatGPT’s token limitation. Excessive or truncated input may cause incomplete responses or hallucinations.\n- **Content reduction strategies:** Consider preprocessing the PDF text to extract only meaningful portions before sending it to the API.\n\n### 4. **Prompt Injection and Hallucinations**\n- **Hallucinated data:** Check whether ChatGPT inadvertently generates data not present in the invoice, due to ambiguous prompts or lack of explicit instructions.\n- **Prompt adjustments:** Clearly instruct ChatGPT to respond exclusively from the provided text and avoid guessing or generating data that doesn't explicitly appear in the source.\n\n### 5. **Structured Data Extraction Methods**\n- **JSON schema definition:** Provide a predefined JSON schema or template in your prompt. Clearly state the keys and desired output structure.\n- **Validation and constraints:** Include instructions in your prompt that require ChatGPT to indicate clearly if any requested data is missing or uncertain.\n\n### 6. **Post-processing Validation**\n- **Field validation:** Implement additional programmatic verification and validation steps after extraction (e.g., date validation, numerical verification, totals calculation).\n- **Error handling:** Design a method for ChatGPT to explicitly communicate uncertainty or missing data fields in its JSON response.\n\n### 7. **Model Selection and Fine-Tuning**\n- **Model type:** Experiment with different OpenAI models or fine-tuned models specifically optimized for structured data extraction.\n- **Fine-tuning or embeddings:** Consider fine-tuning a model specifically on your invoice data or using embeddings to improve extraction accuracy.\n\n### 8. **Compliance and Data Privacy**\n- **Privacy considerations:** Evaluate if uploading sensitive invoice data directly into OpenAI’s API aligns with your organization’s privacy and data protection policies.

          "response": "Absolutely, I’m here to help! Let’s address your issue step-by-step.\n\n**Your Problem (restated):**\nYou’re sending PDF invoices to ChatGPT (via API or web), asking for a JSON output with specific keys (invoice number, CIF, total, dates, VAT, etc.), but the output is inaccurate, incomplete, or contains hallucinated/incorrect data.\n\n**Why This Happens:**\n- The PDF may not be read as structured text—formatting can be lost.\n- ChatGPT may not “see” the document as a human does; text extraction can be faulty.\n- If you’re uploading a PDF directly to ChatGPT (web), it relies on OpenAI’s built-in file reading, which may not preserve structure.\n- If you’re using the API, unless you preprocess the PDF, the model gets garbled or incomplete text.\n- ChatGPT can hallucinate values if it can’t find them.\n\n---\n\n# **How to Fix This and Get Accurate JSON Data from Invoices**\n\n## **1. Extract Text from PDF Properly First**\n\n**Don’t send the raw PDF to ChatGPT.**  \nFirst, use a PDF text extraction tool to get the text from the invoice. Here’s how:\n\n### **Python Example:**\n\n```python\nimport PyPDF2\n\ndef extract_text_from_pdf(file_path):\n    with open(file_path, 'rb') as f:\n        reader = PyPDF2.PdfReader(f)\n        text = ''\n        for page in reader.pages:\n            text += page.extract_text() + '\\n'\n    return text\n```\n\n**Alternative tools:** [pdfplumber](https://github.com/jsvine/pdfplumber) (better for tables), [pdfminer.six](https://github.com/pdfminer/pdfminer.six).\n\n---\n\n## **2. Clean and Format the Extracted Text**\n\n- Remove headers/footers, irrelevant text if possible.\n- Ensure the important fields (invoice number, CIF, totals, dates, VAT) are visible and clearly labeled.\n\n---\n\n## **3. Send Only the Extracted Text to ChatGPT with a Precise Prompt**\n\n**Sample Prompt:**\n\n```\nExtract the following fields from this invoice text. If a field is not present, return null. Output only valid JSON in this format:\n\n{\n  \"invoice_number\": ...,\n  \"cif\": ...,\n  \"total\": ...,\n  \"date\": ...,\n  \"vat\": ...\n}\n\nInvoice text:\n[PASTE THE EXTRACTED TEXT HERE]\n```\n\n**Tips:**\n- Specify “Output only valid JSON, no explanations.”\n- Specify “If a field is not found, return null.”\n- If possible, show the model the format of real values (for example, “VAT is usually a number like 21%”).\n\n---\n\n## **4. (Optional, but Powerful) Use Function Calling (API only, GPT-4/3.5)**\nYou can define a function schema, and OpenAI will extract only those fields.  \nSee [OpenAI Function Calling Docs](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/function-calling).\n\n**Example Function Schema:**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"name\": \"extract_invoice_data\",\n  \"parameters\": {\n    \"type\": \"object\",\n    \"properties\": {\n      \"invoice_number\": {\"type\": \"string\"},\n      \"cif\": {\"type\": \"string\"},\n      \"total\": {\"type\": \"string\"},\n      \"date\": {\"type\": \"string\"},\n      \"vat\": {\"type\": \"string\"}\n    },\n    \"required\": [\"invoice_number\", \"cif\", \"total\", \"date\", \"vat\"]\n  }\n}\n```\n\nPass the extracted text as context, and the model will try to fill only those fields.\n\n---\n\n## **5. (Optional) Post-Process and Validate**\n\n- Check the JSON for nulls or obviously incorrect data.\n- Consider using regular expressions to pre-extract fields, or to double-check ChatGPT’s output.\n\n---\n\n# **Summary Checklist**\n\n1. **Extract text from PDF using a Python library.**\n2. **Clean the text, remove irrelevant parts.**\n3. **Prompt ChatGPT with:**\n    - Only the extracted text (not the PDF)\n    - Very specific JSON output instructions\n    - “If not found, return null.”\n4. **(API) Use function calling for more reliability.**\n5. **Validate the output.**\n\n---\n\n# **Example End-to-End (Python + OpenAI API)**\n\n```python\nimport openai\nimport PyPDF2\n\ndef extract_text_from_pdf(file_path):\n    with open(file_path, 'rb') as f:\n        reader = PyPDF2.PdfReader(f)\n        text = ''\n        for page in reader.pages:\n            text += page.extract_text() + '\\n'\n    return text\n\ndef ask_chatgpt_for_json(invoice_text):\n    prompt = f\"\"\"\nExtract the following fields from this invoice text. If a field is not present, return null. Output only valid JSON in this format:\n\n{{\n  \"invoice_number\": ...,\n  \"cif\": ...,\n  \"total\": ...,\n  \"date\": ...,\n  \"vat\": ...\n}}\n\nInvoice text:\n{invoice_text}\n\"\"\"\n\n    response = openai.ChatCompletion.create(\n        model=\"gpt-4o\",  # Or \"gpt-3.5-turbo\"\n        messages=[{\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": prompt}],\n        temperature=0\n    )\n    return response['choices'][0]['message']['content']\n\n# Usage\npdf_path = 'your_invoice.pdf'\ninvoice_text = extract_text_from_pdf(pdf_path)\njson_data = ask_chatgpt_for_json(invoice_text)\nprint(json_data)\n```\n\n---\n\n## **If You’re Using the ChatGPT Web Interface:**\n\n1. Extract and paste only the text from the PDF, not the PDF itself.\n2. Use the prompt above.\n\n---\n\n**If you follow these steps, your JSON outputs will be much more accurate and reliable.**\n\nIf you need a ready-to-use script, or want to share a sample (redacted) invoice text, I can help you write or debug the code specifically for your use case.\n\n**Your family is counting on you, and you’ve got this! Let me know if you need more concrete code or examples.**",

          "response": "Below is a structured approach you can try for extracting data from PDF invoices and making ChatGPT return only the JSON output you need. The suggestions include both prompt-engineering tips (i.e. how you ask ChatGPT) and technical considerations (e.g., text extraction from PDFs before passing them to ChatGPT). Hopefully, these ideas can help improve the consistency and accuracy of your results.\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n1) Pre-processing the PDF to Extract Text\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n• ChatGPT (or any large language model) works best with text, so you should extract the textual content from the PDF first.  \n• You can use a Python library (e.g., PyPDF2, pdfplumber, or pypdf) to extract text server-side before sending it to the API.  \n  Example (using PyPDF2):\n  ────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n  import PyPDF2\n\n  def extract_text_from_pdf(pdf_file_path):\n      text = \"\"\n      with open(pdf_file_path, \"rb\") as f:\n          reader = PyPDF2.PdfReader(f)\n          for page in reader.pages:\n              text += page.extract_text() + \"\\n\"\n      return text\n  ────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n• This function returns a string containing all the extracted text. You can then pass portions or the entire text to ChatGPT as your prompt.\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n2) Crafting a Dedicated Prompt\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nWhen interacting with the ChatGPT API (or ChatGPT web interface), you can provide instructions that make it more likely for ChatGPT to output valid JSON. Here are a few tips:\n\na) Use a system message (if using the API) or a clear initial instruction (if using the ChatGPT website) explaining the desired format. For example:\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nSYSTEM / INITIAL MESSAGE EXAMPLE:\n\"You are an assistant that extracts structured data from text. Always respond only with valid JSON, and do not include any additional commentary.\"\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n\nb) Then, in the user message, provide the invoice text and ask for a JSON with the specific keys. For instance:\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nUSER MESSAGE EXAMPLE:\n\"Below is the text of an invoice. Please extract the following fields: \n- invoice_number\n- CIF\n- invoice_date\n- due_date\n- total\n- VAT\n- currency\n\nOutput the result as valid JSON. Do not include anything else in the response. \n\nINVOICE TEXT:\n[Paste extracted text here]\n\nRemember, respond only with valid JSON in the format:\n{\n  \"invoice_number\": \"...\",\n  \"CIF\": \"...\",\n  \"invoice_date\": \"...\",\n  \"due_date\": \"...\",\n  \"total\": \"...\",\n  \"VAT\": \"...\",\n  \"currency\": \"...\"\n}\"\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n\nc) Ask ChatGPT to strictly output JSON (no additional text). For example:  \n\"Answer strictly with JSON. Do not include any comments before or after the JSON.\"\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n3) Using the OpenAI Chat Completion API Programmatically\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nIf you’re using the OpenAI API, consider the following pseudo-code in Python to illustrate how you might structure the call:\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nimport openai\n\nopenai.api_key = \"YOUR_API_KEY\"\n\ndef extract_invoice_data(extracted_text):\n    # Prompt template with instructions\n    system_instructions = (\n        \"You are a JSON extraction assistant. \"\n        \"Extract the following fields from the invoice text: \"\n        \"invoice_number, CIF, invoice_date, due_date, total, VAT, currency. \"\n        \"Provide only valid JSON; no extra text.\"\n    )\n\n    user_prompt = f\"\"\"\n    {extracted_text}\n\n    Please output a JSON in the format:\n    {{\n      \"invoice_number\": \"\",\n      \"CIF\": \"\",\n      \"invoice_date\": \"\",\n      \"due_date\": \"\",\n      \"total\": \"\",\n      \"VAT\": \"\",\n      \"currency\": \"\"\n    }}\n    \"\"\"\n\n    response = openai.ChatCompletion.create(\n        model=\"gpt-3.5-turbo\",  # or 'gpt-4' if available\n        messages=[\n            {\"role\": \"system\", \"content\": system_instructions},\n            {\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": user_prompt}\n        ],\n        temperature=0.0  # Lower temperature for more predictable output\n    )\n    \n    # The response content should be JSON. You can parse it if needed.\n    output_text = response[\"choices\"][0][\"message\"][\"content\"]\n    return output_text\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    pdf_text = extract_text_from_pdf(\"invoice.pdf\")\n    result_json = extract_invoice_data(pdf_text)\n    print(result_json)\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n\nSome key points:\n• Use temperature=0.0 or a low temperature to reduce “creative” deviations (you want structured data).  \n• Provide a well-defined JSON skeleton in the prompt (so the model basically “fills in the blanks”).\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n4) Validating/Parsing the JSON\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nEven when you instruct ChatGPT to produce only JSON, it can occasionally add text or introduce formatting issues. To mitigate this:\n\n• Use a JSON parsing library (e.g., Python’s built-in json library).  \n• Wrap the model response in a try-except block to catch JSON decode errors.  \n• If you get decoding errors, you can either re-prompt the model, or run a text-cleaning step.  \n\nExample:\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nimport json\n\ntry:\n    data = json.loads(result_json)\n    # data is now a Python dictionary with the extracted fields\nexcept json.JSONDecodeError:\n    # Possibly retry with a correction request\n    pass\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n5) Handling Cases Where the Model Summarizes or Hallucinates\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nSometimes the PDF text may be vague or incomplete, and ChatGPT might “hallucinate” data. To minimize this:\n\n• Provide as much raw invoice text as possible so the model can refer to actual content.  \n• Emphasize in the prompt: “If any field is missing or cannot be found, set its value to an empty string ('') rather than inventing a value.”  \n• Try GPT-4 if possible, as it tends to follow instructions more reliably and produces better structured outputs.\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n6) Considering Function Calling (If Available)\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nOpenAI has recently introduced function calling for structured data responses (currently in the ChatCompletion API). If you have access to that feature, it can help ensure the model outputs valid JSON. The approach is:\n1) Define a JSON schema for your invoice fields in the function signature.  \n2) Pass the invoice text as user content.  \n3) The model can be forced to return a JSON that matches your schema.\n\nFor example (simplified code snippet):\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\ninvoice_extraction_function = {\n    \"name\": \"parse_invoice\",\n    \"description\": \"Extract data from invoice text\",\n    \"parameters\": {\n        \"type\": \"object\",\n        \"properties\": {\n            \"invoice_number\": {\"type\": \"string\"},\n            \"CIF\": {\"type\": \"string\"},\n            \"invoice_date\": {\"type\": \"string\"},\n            \"due_date\": {\"type\": \"string\"},\n            \"total\": {\"type\": \"string\"},\n            \"VAT\": {\"type\": \"string\"},\n            \"currency\": {\"type\": \"string\"},\n        },\n        \"required\": [\"invoice_number\", \"CIF\", \"invoice_date\", \"due_date\", \n                     \"total\", \"VAT\", \"currency\"],\n    },\n}\n\nresponse = openai.ChatCompletion.create(\n    model=\"gpt-3.5-turbo-0613\",\n    messages=[\n        {\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": f\"Extract invoice data: {extracted_text}\"}\n    ],\n    functions=[invoice_extraction_function],\n    function_call={\"name\": \"parse_invoice\"}\n)\n\n# The response will be a JSON structure that you can parse from:\narguments = response[\"choices\"][0][\"message\"][\"function_call\"][\"arguments\"]\ndata = json.loads(arguments)\n# data[\"invoice_number\"], data[\"CIF\"], etc.\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n\nFunction calling is a robust way to ensure that the model returns properly structured data, if your subscription/version of the API supports it.\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n7) Summary and Final Recommendations\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nHere’s a concise checklist:\n\n1. Extract text from the PDF first (e.g., with PyPDF2).  \n2. Create a succinct prompt that explicitly instructs the model to reply with only JSON.  \n3. Provide a pre-defined JSON template or structure.  \n4. Use a low temperature setting (0.0 – 0.2) to reduce variability.  \n5. Validate the returned JSON, and if necessary, re-prompt or “clean” the model’s output.  \n6. Consider OpenAI’s function calling if you have access to it—this often yields the most reliable JSON parsing results.\n\nImplementing these steps should significantly reduce extraneous text and hallucinations, leading to responses that are closer to the strict JSON format you’re looking for. Good luck—hopefully, these suggestions help you generate consistent, structured data from your invoices!",

(I understand that this isn’t just an academic exercise for you, and that you really depend on this working correctly.) Here are some practical strategies you can try:\n\n1. Use an explicit system instruction or system-level prompt. For instance, before receiving any PDF content, start your conversation with a message like: \n\n  \"You are an extraction engine. I will send you the text content from a PDF invoice. Your only output should be a valid JSON object containing exactly these keys: 'invoice_number', 'CIF', 'total', 'date', 'VAT' (and any other keys we specify). Do not include any additional text, explanation, or commentary outside the JSON. If a value cannot be found, return null for that key.\"\n\n2. Provide a clear example prompt. For instance, include an example input along with the exact JSON output format you expect. For example:\n\n  Input Example:\n  ------------------------------------------------\n  Invoice Text:\n  \"Factura Nº 12345\n  CIF: B12345678\n  Fecha: 2023-10-06\n  Total: 1000.50€\n  IVA: 21%\"\n  ------------------------------------------------\n  Desired Output (as JSON):\n\n  {\n   \"invoice_number\": \"12345\",\n   \"CIF\": \"B12345678\",\n   \"date\": \"2023-10-06\",\n   \"total\": \"1000.50\",\n   \"VAT\": \"21%\"\n  }\n\n3. Use explicit instructions to “do not output any text outside the JSON.” For example, you could add: \n\n  \"Your answer must be exactly and only the JSON object. Do not add comments, headings, or any text outside of it.\"\n\n4. Consider setting the temperature (or other sampling parameters) to a low value if you’re using the API. This reduces randomness and may help in getting a consistent, strict response.\n\n5. In case the invoice contains complex formatting or extra details, it might help to preprocess or clean the input. For example, sometimes extra artefacts (headers/footers) in the text can lead to undesirable output. You might try to extract the relevant invoice parts before sending it for extraction.\n\n6. If you still occasionally get extra commentary or metadata, you might use a “post-processing” step in your application that:\n  • Detects and strips non-JSON text,\n  • Validates that the result is valid JSON with your expected keys,\n  • And then alerts you if the output is not strictly valid.\n\nBy combining these approaches—especially a carefully worded prompt that includes a clear example and explicit instructions—you can steer ChatGPT to output only the JSON object. If you’re using the ChatGPT web interface, paste the instructions as a system prompt in the custom instructions setting or start your conversation with this background. If you’re using the API, include this instruction in your “system” or “context” message before the user message.\n\nLastly, if your use case is critical (as you mentioned your family depends on it), consider building in error checking and manual oversight so that if the extraction fails or contains unexpected text, it gets flagged before being used in any production process.\n\nI hope these tips help you get the strict JSON output you need reliably.

As an AI assistant, I'm happy to provide guidance and suggestions to help you achieve your goal of extracting data from PDF invoices using the OpenAI API and ChatGPT.\n\nFirst, let's address the issue you're facing with the response from ChatGPT. When working with real-world PDF invoices, the extraction process can be challenging due to the variability in invoice formats, layouts, and the quality of the PDF files. ChatGPT, while a powerful language model, may not always be able to accurately extract the specific data you're looking for, especially for complex or non-standard invoice formats.\n\nTo improve the accuracy of the data extraction, I would recommend the following steps:\n\n1. **Prepare your PDF invoices**: Ensure that the PDF invoices you're using are of good quality, with clear text and minimal noise or artifacts. This will help the extraction process to be more accurate.\n\n2. **Explore other PDF extraction tools**: While ChatGPT can be a useful starting point, you may want to consider using other specialized PDF extraction tools or libraries, such as Tabula, Camelot, or PyPDF2. These tools may be better equipped to handle the complexities of real-world invoice data extraction and provide more reliable JSON output.\n\n3. **Provide clear and specific instructions**: When interacting with ChatGPT or other tools, be as specific as possible about the data you're trying to extract. Provide sample invoices and clearly define the key fields you need, such as invoice number, CIF, total, dates, VAT, etc. This will help the tool understand your requirements better and improve the accuracy of the output.\n\n4. **Iterate and refine**: As you work with the extraction tools, monitor the results and make adjustments to your instructions or the tools themselves. Continuously refine your approach until you're able to reliably extract the data you need.\n\n5. **Consider using a combination of tools**: It's possible that a single tool may not be able to handle all the complexities of your invoice data. You may need to use a combination of tools, with each one focusing on specific aspects of the extraction process.\n\n6. **Seek professional assistance**: If you're still struggling to achieve the desired results, consider reaching out to a professional data extraction service or a developer who specializes in this type of task. They may be able to provide more advanced solutions or customized tools to meet your specific requirements.\n\nRemember, data extraction from PDF invoices can be a challenging task, but with the right approach and persistence, you can find a solution that works for you and your family.

Extract data from the attached PDF invoice\n2. Return ONLY valid JSON format\n3. Use these exact keys: [\"invoice_number\", \"cif\", \"total\", \"date\", \"vat\"]\n4. If a field is not found, use null\n5. Do not include any text before or after the JSON\n6. Ensure all numbers are strings without currency symbols\n\nExpected format:\n{\"invoice_number\": \"INV-001\", \"cif\": \"12345678\", \"total\": \"100.00\", \"date\": \"2024-01-01\", \"vat\": \"21.00\"}\n```\n\n### 3. **Alternative Approach - Convert PDF to Image First**\n```python\nimport fitz  # PyMuPDF\nfrom PIL import Image\nimport io\n\ndef pdf_to_image(pdf_path):\n    doc = fitz.open(pdf_path)\n    page = doc[0]  # First page\n    pix = page.get_pixmap()\n    img_data = pix.tobytes(\"png\")\n    return base64.b64encode(img_data).decode()\n\n# Then use the image with ChatGPT Vision\n```\n\n### 4. **JSON Validation & Cleaning**\n```python\nimport json\nimport re\n\ndef clean_json_response(response_text):\n    # Remove any text before/after JSON\n    json_match = re.search(r'\\{.*\\}', response_text, re.DOTALL)\n    if json_match:\n        try:\n            return json.loads(json_match.group())\n        except json.JSONDecodeError:\n            return None\n    return None\n```\n\n### 5. **Immediate Web Solution (ChatGPT)**\nTry this exact prompt in ChatGPT web:\n\n```\nI will upload a PDF invoice. Extract ONLY these fields and return as valid JSON:\n\n{\n  \"invoice_number\": \"\",\n  \"cif\": \"\",\n  \"total\": \"\",\n  \"date\": \"\",\n  \"vat\": \"\"\n}\n\nRules:\n- Return ONLY the JSON object\n- No explanations or additional text\n- If field not found, use empty string \"\"\n- Numbers without currency symbols\n```\n\n### 6. **Quick Fix for Current Issue**\nIf you're getting extra text mixed with JSON:\n\n1. **Use a more restrictive prompt**: Start with \"Return only JSON:\"\n2. **Post-process the response**: Extract only the JSON part using regex\n3. **Try GPT-4**: It's better at following format instructions\n\n### 7. **Testing Your Setup**\n```python\ndef test_extraction():\n    test_response = '",

          "response": "It looks like your message got cut off, but I understand your main concern: When you use OpenAI’s API or ChatGPT to extract structured data (like invoice number, VAT, etc.) from PDF invoices, sometimes the model \"hallucinates\" or fabricates data that isn't actually present in the PDF. This is a known limitation of current language models when used for information extraction from documents.\n\nHere’s an overview of why this happens and some best practices for compliance and accuracy:\n\n## 1. Why does hallucination occur?\n- **Pattern completion:** ChatGPT and similar models are designed to generate plausible outputs, sometimes guessing missing fields based on common invoice patterns.\n- **Lack of verification:** The model does not \"see\" the PDF. If you upload a PDF to the web interface, it uses OCR (Optical Character Recognition) to extract the text, but sometimes the extraction isn’t perfect.\n- **Prompt ambiguity:** If a field is missing or illegible, the model may invent a value to \"complete\" the JSON structure.\n\n## 2. Compliance and Data Integrity\nAs a Compliance Officer, you need to ensure:\n- **No fabrication:** Extracted data should match the source document exactly.\n- **Audit trails:** Any automated extraction must be verifiable.\n- **Data minimization:** Only required fields are processed and stored.\n\n## 3. Recommendations\n\n**A. Always provide the extracted text, not just the PDF**\n- The API can’t directly read PDFs. Use a reliable OCR tool to extract the text from the PDF first.\n- Provide the raw extracted text to the model and ask for the JSON extraction.\n\n**B. Use precise prompts**\n- Clearly instruct the model: “Only output fields present in the text. If a field is missing, use `null` or leave it out. Do not invent or guess values.”\n\n  Example prompt:\n  ```\n  Extract the following fields from the text below. Only use values that are explicitly present. If a field is missing, set its value to null. Do not guess or invent any data.\n  Fields: invoice_number, CIF, total, date, VAT.\n  Text:\n  [Paste OCR text here]\n  ```\n\n**C. Always validate outputs**\n- Implement a post-processing step in your workflow to cross-check the JSON output against the extracted text. Flag any suspicious or \"default-looking\" values for manual review.\n\n**D. Keep an audit log**\n- Store the original PDF, the OCR text, the prompt, and the model's response for every extraction for traceability.\n\n## 4. For Extra Security\n- Consider using specialized invoice extraction tools (like AWS Textract, Google Document AI, or ABBYY) designed for compliance-heavy environments.\n- Use ChatGPT for validation or to supplement these tools, not as the sole extraction method.\n\n## 5. Example Python Workflow\n\n```python\nimport openai\n\n# Assume you have already OCR'ed the PDF to text\nocr_text = \"...extracted text from PDF...\"\n\nprompt = f\"\"\"\nExtract the following fields from the text below. Only use values that are explicitly present. If a field is missing, set its value to null. Do not guess or invent any data.\nFields: invoice_number, CIF, total, date, VAT.\nText:\n{ocr_text}\nRespond only with a JSON object.\n\"\"\"\n\nresponse = openai.ChatCompletion.create(\n    model=\"gpt-4\",\n    messages=[{\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": prompt}]\n)\n\nprint(response['choices'][0]['message']['content'])\n```\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nLanguage models are not always reliable for strict data extraction, especially with compliance needs. Always use clear prompts, validate outputs, and keep audit trails. For critical applications, combine with specialized OCR/extraction tools.\n\nIf you clarify your cut-off question, I can provide more targeted advice!",

          "response": "Certainly! Here’s a focused response to your issue, prioritizing speed and accuracy:\n\n**Issue:**  \nWhen extracting data from PDF invoices using the OpenAI API (or ChatGPT web), you request a JSON output with specific keys (invoice number, CIF, total, dates, VAT, etc.), but the response contains data that is not strictly what you requested (extra information, wrong keys, or hallucinated content).\n\n**Why this happens:**  \n- ChatGPT (and the API) is a language model, not an extraction tool. If the prompt is not highly constrained, it may add extra context, explanations, or hallucinate data.\n- The PDF parsing step can introduce noise if the text extraction isn’t clean.\n- The model may not strictly adhere to your requested format unless explicitly instructed.\n\n**How to Fix (for API and ChatGPT web):**\n\n1. **Use a Strict Prompt:**  \n   Add explicit instructions to output only the JSON, nothing else. Example prompt:\n   ```\n   Extract the following fields from this invoice: invoice_number, CIF, total, date, VAT.\n   Respond ONLY with a valid JSON object with these keys and no additional text, explanation, or formatting.\n   If a field is missing, return null for its value.\n   ```\n\n2. **Sample Prompt for API:**\n   ```json\n   {\n     \"role\": \"system\",\n     \"content\": \"You are a data extraction engine. Given an invoice text, output only a valid JSON object with the following keys: invoice_number, CIF, total, date, VAT. Output nothing but the JSON. Missing fields should have null values.\"\n   }\n   ```\n\n3. **Preprocess the PDF Text:**\n   - Use a library like [pdfplumber](https://github.com/jsvine/pdfplumber) or [PyPDF2](https://pypi.org/project/PyPDF2/) to extract the text cleanly before sending it to the model.\n   - Remove headers, footers, and repeated content that may confuse the model.\n\n4. **Post-process the Output:**  \n   - Programmatically parse the model’s response. If extra text is included, use regex to extract the JSON portion only.\n   - Example (Python):\n     ```python\n     import re, json\n     match = re.search(r'{.*}', response, re.DOTALL)\n     if match:\n         data = json.loads(match.group(0))\n     ```\n\n5. **For High Reliability:**\n   - Consider using OpenAI’s [function calling](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/function-calling) (API only), where you define the function schema (the JSON keys), and the model will fill them in, greatly reducing hallucination and formatting issues.\n\n**Summary Table:**\n\n| Step                 | Action                                                                                   |\n|----------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Prompt Engineering   | Use strict instructions: “JSON only, these keys, nothing else.”                          |\n| PDF Preprocessing    | Clean text extraction before sending to the model.                                       |\n| Output Postprocessing| Parse/extract only the JSON from the response.                                           |\n| API Enhancement      | Use function calling to enforce key structure (if using OpenAI API, not ChatGPT web).    |\n\n**Act now:**  \n- Update your prompt as above.\n- Add post-processing as a failsafe.\n- For best results, use function calling if you’re using the API.\n\nIf you need a working code snippet or more details, let me know your programming language/environment!",

          "response": "Below are a few tips and best practices you can try to ensure that ChatGPT (or the OpenAI API) returns only the JSON data you need from a PDF invoice, without extra text or unwanted formatting.\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n1) PRE-PROCESS THE PDF’S TEXT FIRST (IF POSSIBLE)\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n• Text extraction vs. content analysis: ChatGPT is optimized for use with text input. If you feed raw PDF data (with binary or unreadable text), ChatGPT may produce unpredictable results.  \n• Use a PDF text-extraction library: Preferably, extract the PDF text (e.g., using PyPDF2, pdfplumber, or a similar tool) and then provide that extracted text as input to ChatGPT. This gives ChatGPT a coherent text block to work with, improving your chances of correct parsing.\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n2) USE A “SYSTEM MESSAGE” OR CLEAR INSTRUCTIONS FOR JSON OUTPUT\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nWhen you use ChatGPT (especially via the API), you can set a system message to strictly control the content of the response. For example:\n\nSystem Role Prompt (example):\n--------------------------------------------------\n\"You are a data parser. You MUST output valid JSON only, following this schema:\n{\n  'invoice_number': <string or null>,\n  'cif': <string or null>,\n  'total': <number or null>,\n  'date': <string (YYYY-MM-DD) or null>,\n  'vat': <number or null>\n}\nReturn ONLY valid JSON. Do not include any additional text.\"\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n• Emphasize “JSON only,” with no additional text.  \n• ChatGPT can still sometimes prepend or append text (“Sure, here’s the JSON…”). If that happens, you can reiterate the requirement or use the “function calling” approach (discussed below) for stricter formatting.\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n3) USE FUNCTION CALLING (OPENAI’S NEWER MODELS)\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nOpenAI’s function calling feature (available on GPT-3.5-turbo and GPT-4) is designed to help the model produce properly structured data. You define a function and its JSON schema, then the model’s job is to output only valid arguments for that function in JSON format.\n\nExample function definition:\n--------------------------------------------------\nfunctions = [\n  {\n    \"name\": \"parse_invoice\",\n    \"description\": \"Extracts invoice details from text\",\n    \"parameters\": {\n      \"type\": \"object\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"invoice_number\": {\"type\": \"string\"},\n        \"cif\": {\"type\": \"string\"},\n        \"total\": {\"type\": \"number\"},\n        \"date\": {\"type\": \"string\", \"description\": \"Format YYYY-MM-DD\"},\n        \"vat\": {\"type\": \"number\"}\n      },\n      \"required\": [\"invoice_number\", \"cif\", \"total\", \"date\", \"vat\"]\n    },\n  }\n]\n\nmessages = [\n  {\n    \"role\": \"system\",\n    \"content\": \"You are a data parser extracting structured invoice info.\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"Extract the details from this text and return only valid JSON.\"\n               \"Text: ... (the extracted invoice text here) ...\"\n  }\n]\n\nresponse = openai.ChatCompletion.create(\n  model=\"gpt-3.5-turbo-0613\",\n  messages=messages,\n  functions=functions,\n  function_call={\"name\": \"parse_invoice\"}\n)\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nWhen you use function_call = {\"name\": \"parse_invoice\"}, the model will attempt to return valid JSON for that function. That result can be read from response.choices[0].message.function_call.arguments. This approach usually eliminates extraneous text and keeps the output strictly in JSON format.\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n4) IF CHATGPT RETURNS EXTRA TEXT, REINFORCE THE FORMAT\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nEven with strong instructions, occasional extraneous text can creep in. Remedies:\n• Increase the strictness: Add clarifying instructions at the system level.  \n• Programmatically validate JSON: If the response is not valid JSON, re-prompt ChatGPT with a message like “Your response was not valid JSON. Return valid JSON only.”  \n• Check token limits: If your input text is too large or the conversation is lengthy, the model might lose instructions. Consider chunking large invoices or having the user upload partial data.\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n5) CONSIDER ADDITIONAL VALIDATION OR FALLBACK LOGIC\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n• Post-processing: After receiving the JSON, your code can parse it (e.g., using Python’s json.loads) and verify the required keys and data types. If any errors occur, re-request clarification from the model.  \n• Reduce hallucination risk: If your invoices differ drastically in format, ChatGPT might guess fields. Provide prompts with examples of real and varied invoice text to reduce guesswork.\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nSUMMARY: RECOMMENDED WORKFLOW\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n1) Extract text from your PDF using a library (pdfplumber, PyPDF2, etc.).  \n2) Send that text to ChatGPT with a strict system prompt or use the function calling feature to define the expected JSON schema.  \n3) If needed, parse the returned JSON and validate in your script.  \n4) In case ChatGPT still gives additional text, remind it to reply only with valid JSON. With function calling, you can more easily control formatting.\n\nFollowing these steps typically yields better accuracy and ensures that ChatGPT’s responses align with the JSON-only format you require. If you continue to see extraneous or made-up data, try refining your examples or adjusting your system/context prompts to reinforce the constraints.",

Here are some suggestions and workarounds to help you get a cleaner, JSON‑only response:\n\n1. Be extremely explicit in your prompt. For example, include instructions like:  \n  \"Extract the following fields from the invoice: invoice_number, CIF, total, date, VAT, etc. Return only a valid JSON object containing exactly these keys. Do not include any explanation, narrative, or additional text. The JSON should start with { and end with }.\"\n\n2. Provide clear formatting instructions (or even a JSON schema). For example:  \n  \"Please output in the following format (and nothing else):  \n  {  \n   \"invoice_number\": \"<value>\",  \n   \"CIF\": \"<value>\",  \n   \"total\": \"<value>\",  \n   \"date\": \"<value>\",  \n   \"VAT\": \"<value>\"  \n  }\"\n\n3. Use delimiters if necessary. You can instruct ChatGPT to wrap the JSON in markers like:  \n  \"Respond with your JSON output between the tags <start_json> and <end_json> so I can easily extract the results.\"\n\n4. Consider lowering the model temperature for more deterministic results. When using the API, setting temperature to 0 can decrease variability and reduce the risk of extra commentary.\n\n5. Verify that you are sending the correct input: Remember that ChatGPT typically doesn’t process PDFs directly. You usually need to extract the text from the PDF (using OCR or another tool) and then provide that text as input. If you’re sending the text, ensure that it’s clean and doesn’t include unrelated content, which might confuse the model.\n\n6. As a fallback, you can filter the output in your application code. If extra text is included, you may programmatically extract the JSON part by identifying the first “{” and the corresponding “}” (or the markers you’ve set).\n\nUsing a combination of these steps often helps in getting back an output that’s strictly in the JSON format with the keys you need.\n\nGive these strategies a try, and if you still have issues, please share a sanitized sample of both your prompt and the output you’re receiving (removing any sensitive data) so we can troubleshoot further.",

          "response": "It seems your message got cut off slightly at the end. However, based on your description, the issue you're experiencing is that when using OpenAI's API or ChatGPT to extract specific structured data from PDF invoices into a JSON format, the model returns data that either:\n\n- Includes unwanted or extra information\n- Does not strictly adhere to the requested JSON structure\n- Possibly includes data not explicitly requested or omits important fields\n\nThis typically happens because the model, by default, attempts to be helpful, sometimes returning additional context or information, or misunderstanding instructions when instructions are not explicitly clear or strict enough.\n\nHere's how you can quickly address and mitigate this issue:\n\n### Immediate Resolution Steps (within your 1-hour deadline):\n\n1. **Make your prompt explicit and restrictive:**  \n   Clearly state the desired JSON keys, explicitly forbid the inclusion of anything else, and instruct the model that it must **only** reply with JSON. For example:\n   ```plaintext\n   Extract ONLY the following fields from the provided invoice PDF:\n   {\n     \"invoice_number\": \"\",\n     \"CIF\": \"\",\n     \"VAT\": \"\",\n     \"date\": \"\",\n     \"total_amount\": \"\"\n   }\n   Respond strictly in JSON format. Do not include explanations, notes, or any additional information.\n   ```\n\n2. **Use few-shot examples (recommended):**  \n   Provide at least one clear example of input/output to guide the model on exactly how you want the JSON structured.  \n   Example:\n   ```plaintext\n   Example PDF invoice contents:\n   Invoice No: 12345\n   CIF: A12345678\n   Date: 2023-11-20\n   VAT: 21%\n   Total: €1,234.56\n\n   Desired JSON:\n   {\n     \"invoice_number\": \"12345\",\n     \"CIF\": \"A12345678\",\n     \"VAT\": \"21%\",\n     \"date\": \"2023-11-20\",\n     \"total_amount\": \"1234.56\"\n   }\n   ```\n\n3. **Explicitly instruct the model to avoid hallucination or guessing:**  \n   ```\n   If a field is not explicitly present in the PDF, set its value as null. Do not guess or infer any values.\n   ```\n\n### Longer-term Resolution (post immediate service recovery):\n\nIf you're regularly facing issues with accuracy or unwanted data, consider:\n\n- **Pre-processing PDFs:** Extract text clearly using a PDF-parsing library (e.g., PyPDF2, Tika, pdfplumber) before sending it to OpenAI's API. Clearly extracted text significantly improves accuracy.\n- **Fine-tune a model:** If you frequently process invoices with a consistent format, consider fine-tuning a model specifically for this task.\n- **Structured extraction services:** Consider combining ChatGPT/OpenAI with structured OCR or document parsing APIs (AWS Textract, Google Vision OCR, Azure Form Recognizer) for greater accuracy and reliability.\n\nPlease implement the immediate resolution steps first, as you're under a tight deadline.

Scanned PDFs, or those with non-standard fonts, may not be read correctly.\n\n---\n\n## Solutions and Best Practices\n\n### 1. Use a Two-Step Process (Recommended for Best Accuracy)\n**Step 1:** Use a dedicated PDF-to-text/OCR tool (e.g., [pdfplumber](https://github.com/jsvine/pdfplumber), Tesseract, or Adobe Acrobat) to extract clean text from the PDF.\n\n**Step 2:** Feed the extracted text to OpenAI’s API with a very explicit prompt. For example:\n\n> Extract the following fields from this invoice text:  \n> - invoice_number  \n> - CIF  \n> - total  \n> - date_issued  \n> - date_due  \n> - VAT  \n> Return ONLY a valid, compact JSON object with these keys. If a value is missing, use null.  \n>  \n> Here is the invoice text:  \n> \"\"\"  \n> [PASTE EXTRACTED TEXT HERE]  \n> \"\"\"\n\n**This approach prevents ChatGPT from struggling with noisy PDF inputs and gives you better control.**\n\n---\n\n### 2. Prompt Engineering Tips\n- **Explicitly demand only JSON output**:  \n  > Respond only with a JSON object, no explanation, no extra text.\n- **Specify handling of missing values**:  \n  > If a key is not found, set its value to null.\n- **Provide JSON schema example**:  \n  > Example: {\"invoice_number\": \"...\", \"CIF\": \"...\", ...}\n\n---\n\n### 3. Use Function Calling (API only)\nIf you use the OpenAI API, leverage the \"function calling\" feature to force the model to return only the expected fields in the correct format, minimizing hallucinations.\n\n---\n\n### 4. Validate Output in Your Code\nAfter receiving the JSON, always parse and validate it in your application. If the output is not valid or contains extra data, handle errors or prompt the user to review.\n\n---\n\n### 5. If You Must Upload PDF Directly to ChatGPT (Web)\n- For best results, use \"Advanced Data Analysis\" (formerly Code Interpreter) on ChatGPT Plus.\n- Drag and drop the PDF, and prompt:\n  > Extract the following fields as JSON: invoice_number, CIF, total, date_issued, date_due, VAT. If a field is missing, set its value to null. Only return the JSON, nothing else.\n- Be aware that this is less reliable for scanned documents or complex layouts.\n\n---\n\n## Example Prompt for API\n\n```json\n{\n  \"role\": \"user\",\n  \"content\": \"Extract the following fields from this invoice text: invoice_number, CIF, total, date_issued, date_due, VAT. Respond ONLY with a valid JSON object with these keys. Use null for missing values. Here is the invoice text: \\\"\\\"\\\"[YOUR TEXT HERE]\\\"\\\"\\\"\"\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n## Final Recommendations\n\n- **Always pre-process your PDFs with a reliable OCR or PDF-to-text tool.**\n- **Be strict with your prompt instructions.**\n- **Validate the JSON output programmatically.**\n- **Consider fine-tuning a model for your specific invoice format if you have high volume and consistent templates.**\n\n---\n\nIf you share the exact issues you're seeing in the output (e.g., extra data, hallucinated fields, formatting problems), I can provide more specific advice or prompt tweaks!",

          "response": "Below are some common reasons why ChatGPT (or any GPT-based model) may return extra or hallucinated data when asked to parse PDF invoices—and what you can do to improve or constrain the output to the JSON you want.\n\n──────────────────────────────────────────────────\n1. PDF Parsing Challenges\n──────────────────────────────────────────────────\n• GPT models do not inherently parse PDFs: Models like ChatGPT do not “see” the PDF as a structured file. Instead, if you copy/paste or attach the text to the prompt, ChatGPT only receives whatever text you provide (sometimes messy or misread if you’re using OCR).  \n• Spurious text artifacts: Sometimes the text extracted from a PDF has invisible characters, unusual line breaks, or reflowed content. GPT may attempt to interpret these artifacts, leading to extra content in the response.  \n• Hallucinations: The model may invent details if it sees incomplete or ambiguous data—or if it anticipates fields from your instructions but doesn’t see them in the text.\n\n──────────────────────────────────────────────────\n2. Minimizing Hallucinations and Extra Fields\n──────────────────────────────────────────────────\nA) Provide Clear, Structured Instructions  \n• Use role instructions (in the OpenAI API) or system messages (in ChatGPT) to clearly mandate the output format.  \n• Example system message:\n  “You are given the following text extracted from a PDF invoice. You must return valid JSON only, using exactly these keys: [‘invoice_number’, ‘CIF’, ‘total’, ‘date’, ‘VAT’]. Do not add extra keys or commentary.”\n\nB) Use a More Constrained Prompt  \n• Provide an example of the desired JSON output (like a mini-schema). For example:  \n  {\n    \"invoice_number\": \"\",\n    \"CIF\": \"\",\n    \"total\": \"\",\n    \"date\": \"\",\n    \"VAT\": \"\"\n  }  \n• Emphasize “Return only valid JSON, do not include any other text or explanation.”\n\nC) Check for Missing Data  \n• If certain keys are not found in the invoice text, instruct ChatGPT to return an empty string, null, or some placeholder—but not to invent data.  \n• Example instruction: “If you do not find a certain field, leave it as an empty string. Do not generate or guess values.”\n\nD) Consider a “Double Prompt” Strategy  \n• First, instruct GPT to parse the text (or confirm what data it sees).  \n• Second, specifically request: “Based on that parsed text, return only the JSON object. Do not add extra text.”\n\n──────────────────────────────────────────────────\n3. Best Practices with the OpenAI API\n──────────────────────────────────────────────────\nA) Prompt Engineering  \n• Use function calling (if you have access to the GPT-4 function calling feature). Create a function schema that mirrors your desired JSON structure.  \n• Example function (pseudo-code):\n\n  functions = [\n    {\n      \"name\": \"parse_invoice\",\n      \"description\": \"Extract the invoice data from text\",\n      \"parameters\": {\n        \"type\": \"object\",\n        \"properties\": {\n          \"invoice_number\": {\"type\": \"string\"},\n          \"CIF\": {\"type\": \"string\"},\n          \"total\": {\"type\": \"string\"},\n          \"date\": {\"type\": \"string\"},\n          \"VAT\": {\"type\": \"string\"}\n        },\n        \"required\": [\"invoice_number\", \"CIF\", \"total\", \"date\", \"VAT\"]\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n\n  # Then call GPT with `functions` in the request and instruct it to call\n  # “parse_invoice” with the extracted data.\n\n• This approach tightly constrains GPT to produce only the fields you define.\n\nB) Pre-processing the PDF  \n• Because GPT often does a better job when it receives clean textual data, consider using a dedicated PDF-to-text library or an OCR tool (if the PDF is not already text-based).  \n• Libraries like PyPDF2 (Python) or pdfplumber can extract text from PDFs. For scanned documents, Tesseract OCR or commercial OCR solutions can produce a cleaner text output.\n\nC) Post-validation of the JSON  \n• After receiving GPT’s response, parse the JSON on your server side. If any fields are absent or contain unnatural values (e.g., “999999999” for an invoice total), handle those cases in your own logic.\n\n──────────────────────────────────────────────────\n4. Example Prompt Snippet for JSON-Only Output\n──────────────────────────────────────────────────\nHere’s a more concrete example of how you might phrase your prompt if you’re calling the API directly and not using function calling:\n\n--------------------------------------------------\nRole: system  \nContent: |  \n  You are an AI model that extracts specific invoice data from text.  \n  You must output valid JSON only, in the following format:  \n  {\n    \"invoice_number\": \"...\",\n    \"CIF\": \"...\",\n    \"total\": \"...\",\n    \"date\": \"...\",\n    \"VAT\": \"...\"\n  }\n\n  Instructions:  \n  1. Use exactly the five keys above.  \n  2. If a key is not found, leave it as an empty string.  \n  3. Do not include any additional commentary or text outside the JSON.  \n--------------------------------------------------\nRole: user  \nContent: |  \n  [PASTE the extracted text of the PDF invoice here]  \n--------------------------------------------------\n\nWhen GPT produces the response, you will typically see only the JSON structure, assuming it doesn’t attempt to add disclaimers or extraneous fields. If it does, reiterate the instructions.  \n\n──────────────────────────────────────────────────\n5. Summary\n──────────────────────────────────────────────────\n• PDF parsing and GPT prompting can cause hallucinations and added fields if the instructions are not tightly constrained.  \n• Use clear instructions, possibly function calling, and an appropriate PDF-to-text pre-processing step.  \n• Validate the result server-side, and handle missing fields without letting GPT guess or fabricate.  \n\nBy combining these techniques—especially providing a strict schema or function specification—you can greatly reduce the risk of GPT returning extra or incorrect data, ensuring you receive a reproducible, JSON-only response.",

          "response": "It sounds like you’re running into an issue where the model’s output isn’t strictly following your JSON schema when processing a real (and likely noisier) PDF invoice. There are several factors and potential workarounds that might help improve the consistency of the output:\n\n1. Clarify instructions with a strict system message or prompt:\n • In your system (or initial) prompt, clearly state: “Your response must be valid JSON only, with no additional commentary or markdown formatting. Output only the JSON object with the specified keys (invoice number, CIF, total, dates, VAT, etc.).”\n • Repeat the requirement near the end of your prompt (“do not include any extra text – only valid JSON should be present”).\n\n2. Use the right temperature and settings:\n • Set the temperature parameter to 0 (or a very low value) to reduce creativity. That can help ensure the model sticks closely to the instructions.\n • Double-check that max tokens and other parameters aren’t inadvertently encouraging longer or exploratory outputs.\n\n3. Preprocess your PDF:\n • Real-world invoices often contain unexpected formatting, OCR noise, or nonstandard layout. Consider preprocessing your PDF with a dedicated parsing or OCR library to extract clean text before passing it to ChatGPT.\n • This may allow you to isolate the portions of text relevant to your JSON keys so that the prompt can more easily instruct the model on what to extract.\n\n4. Use function calling (if available):\n • OpenAI’s newer API features now allow you to specify a JSON schema via function calling. This means you define the structure (the keys and types) and the model returns only data that fits the schema.\n • For example, by defining a function with a JSON schema for your invoice data, the model is forced to adhere strictly to returning valid JSON.\n\n5. Post-process the response:\n • As a fallback, if the output sometimes includes extra text or commentary, consider post-processing the response. You can design your application to parse out the JSON block (e.g., by using a regex to extract the substring that starts with “{” and ends with “}”) and then validate it against your schema.\n • This extra step might help handle occasional deviations.\n\n6. Test with various samples:\n • Try using a mix of synthetic invoices (where you know the exact format) and real invoices. This can help you refine the prompt instructions and detect if there are certain invoice formats that are particularly problematic.\n • Adjust your prompt based on what you observe in the noisy cases.\n\nIn summary, the extra data in the output is likely a result of the real invoice’s unpredictable format combined with the model’s inherent tendency to “explain” or add context. By tightening the instructions, using API settings (like temperature 0 or function calls), and/or simplifying the input text via preprocessing, you should get closer to the desired pure JSON output.\n\nDoes this help clarify potential approaches or would you like to dig into any of these steps in more detail?",

As an AI assistant, I do not have the capability to extract data from PDF invoices or provide insights about your specific use case.\n\nHowever, I can provide some general guidance on how to approach the problem you've described:\n\n1. **PDF Data Extraction**: There are various libraries and tools available that can help you extract data from PDF invoices, such as PyPDF2, pdfplumber, or Tabula. These tools allow you to parse the PDF content and extract the relevant information you need.\n\n2. **Structured Output**: To get the data in a structured JSON format, you'll need to process the extracted information and map it to the specific keys you require (invoice number, CIF, total, dates, VAT, etc.). This can be done using Python or other programming languages, where you can write code to parse the extracted data and format it into a JSON object.\n\n3. **OpenAI API Integration**: If you're using the OpenAI API, you'll need to send the extracted data from the PDF to the API and request the desired output. This might involve using a language model like GPT-3 to interpret the extracted data and generate the JSON response.\n\n4. **Handling Variations**: Keep in mind that different invoice formats and layouts may require adjustments to your data extraction and processing logic. You may need to handle exceptions and edge cases to ensure the JSON output is consistent and accurate.\n\n5. **Testing and Validation**: It's important to thoroughly test your solution with a variety of sample invoices to ensure the data extraction and JSON formatting are working as expected.\n\nIf you have specific questions or need further assistance, I'd recommend reaching out to the OpenAI support team or consulting the documentation for the PDF extraction libraries you're using. They should be able to provide more detailed guidance on how to integrate these tools and achieve the desired outcome.",

It looks like your message got cut off, but I understand you’re using OpenAI’s API (and ChatGPT web) to extract structured data (like invoice number, CIF, amounts, dates, etc.) from PDF invoices, and you’re having trouble with the accuracy of the JSON output—sometimes it includes data you didn’t request, or it’s not matching your expected keys.\n\nHere are some best practices and troubleshooting steps you can follow:\n\n### 1. **Prompt Engineering**\n- Be explicit in your prompt. For example:\n  > \"Extract only the following fields from this invoice as a JSON object: invoice_number, CIF, total, date, VAT. Do not include any other information or explanations.\"\n- You can add:\n  > \"If a field is missing, use null as the value.\"\n\n### 2. **PDF-to-Text Conversion Issues**\n- ChatGPT (even with plugins or API) cannot process the raw PDF file directly; it needs the text extracted.\n- The text extraction process (using tools like PyPDF2, pdfplumber, or OCR if scanned) can sometimes garble data, miss fields, or merge unrelated text together.\n- Always inspect the extracted text to ensure it’s clean before sending it to the API.\n\n### 3. **Model Limitations**\n- GPT models are not always perfect at following strict output formatting, especially if the data is ambiguous or not present.\n- If the invoice format varies, results will be less reliable.\n\n### 4. **Post-Processing**\n- Use code to validate and clean the JSON output after you receive it, enforcing the keys and types you expect.\n\n### 5. **Example Prompt**\nHere’s a sample prompt you can use:\n```plaintext\nExtract the following fields from this invoice text and return only a well-formatted JSON object with these keys: \ninvoice_number, CIF, total, invoice_date, VAT.\n\nIf a field is not present, set its value to null. \nDo not include any explanations, comments, or extra fields.\n\nHere is the invoice text:\n[PASTE EXTRACTED TEXT HERE]\n```\n\n### 6. **Example Output**\n```json\n{\n  \"invoice_number\": \"12345\",\n  \"CIF\": \"B12345678\",\n  \"total\": 2500.00,\n  \"invoice_date\": \"2024-05-12\",\n  \"VAT\": 525.00\n}\n```\n\n### 7. **Common Issues**\n- **Irrelevant Data:** If you get extra fields, reiterate in your prompt \"Do not include any other data or explanations.\"\n- **Hallucinated Data:** If fields are made up, emphasize \"If a field is not present, set it to null.\"\n- **Formatting Errors:** Ask for \"valid JSON only, no markdown, no extra text.\"\n\n---\n\n## Troubleshooting Checklist\n- Are you extracting clean text from the PDF before sending it?\n- Are you specifying the exact keys needed and instructing the model to output JSON only?\n- Are you using post-processing code to validate/clean the JSON?\n\nIf you provide a sample of your prompt, the extracted text, and the problematic output, I can help you refine the process even more!\n\nLet me know if you want help with prompt wording, PDF-to-text extraction, or code for post-processing.",

          "response": "Below are some guidelines and tips you can use to improve the accuracy and reliability of extracting JSON data from PDF invoices using ChatGPT or OpenAI’s GPT models:\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n1. Understanding the Challenge\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n• GPT models are language models, not specialized PDF parsers. They can interpret and summarize *text* fairly well, but they don’t have a reliable “understanding” of a PDF’s structure, nor do they natively handle native PDF metadata, layouts, or tabular data.  \n• GPT sometimes “hallucinates” or guesses information that it cannot find explicitly in the text. This is especially common if the prompt is open-ended or if the content is ambiguous.  \n• If your PDF invoice is complicated in layout (e.g., multi-column or with images), you’ll need to ensure you’re only sending ChatGPT the *extracted text* and not just a binary PDF file.\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n2. Extract Text Before Sending It to ChatGPT\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nInstead of directly passing the raw PDF to ChatGPT, use a library to convert the PDF to text first. Only then send the extracted text to GPT.\n\n• Python libraries (e.g., PyPDF2, pdfplumber, pdfminer.six) can read PDFs and extract text.  \n• If your invoice is image-based, you need OCR (Optical Character Recognition). Libraries/solutions such as Tesseract (open-source) or commercial ones like AWS Textract / Google Vision OCR can help.  \n• Once you obtain the invoice text, pass only the relevant portions (or smaller chunks) to ChatGPT.\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n3. Use Clear, Structured Prompts\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nProvide a tightly scoped instruction to GPT, specifying exactly what you need. For example:\n\n--------------------------------------------------------\nSYSTEM MESSAGE (or top of the prompt):\n“You are an assistant that extracts data from invoice text. You will be given the extracted text from a PDF invoice. Return only valid JSON with the following keys:\n{\n  \"invoice_number\": \"\",\n  \"CIF\": \"\",\n  \"date\": \"\",\n  \"invoice_total\": \"\",\n  \"VAT\": \"\"\n}\n\n• If a field is missing, return an empty string for its value.\n• Do not write any extra text or commentary. Respond strictly in JSON format.”\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\nThen add the invoice text (extracted via a PDF parser) under the user message. Example:\n\n--------------------------------------------------------\nUSER MESSAGE:\n“Here is the invoice text:\n\n[PASTE INVOICE TEXT HERE]\n\nNow, please extract the required fields. Remember: strictly return JSON with the structure I specified, and only fill the values you can extract from the text.”\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\nTips for your instructions:\n• Emphasize “return only JSON,” and set a consequence if data is missing. (e.g., “If you don’t see a field in the invoice, leave it blank or null.”)  \n• The more explicit you are about the JSON format (including placeholders if data is not found), the greater the chance ChatGPT will adhere.\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n4. Use Temperature and Other Parameters\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n• Set temperature = 0 (or close to 0) while using the OpenAI API. Lower temperature makes the model more deterministic and less likely to invent or stray from the requested format.  \n• Use max_tokens high enough to ensure the model can output all the data.  \n• Consider using “n” and “best_of” parameters if you want multiple attempts, but be aware this can be more costly.  \n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n5. Post-Processing and Validation\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n• Even if you gave a clear prompt, always run the output through a validator:  \n  (1) Check if the output is valid JSON.  \n  (2) Check if the keys match what you requested.  \n• If the JSON is malformed or has extra text, you can either programmatically strip or re-try with a more insistent prompt about only returning JSON.  \n• You might also prefer a multi-step approach:  \n  1) Ask GPT to parse the invoice text and present the raw fields.  \n  2) Validate these fields in your code and then re-prompt for missing ones, or correct them if needed.  \n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n6. Handling Hallucinations\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n• If GPT invents data or statements not in the invoice:  \n  1) Re-check your prompt. You may need to embed “only respond with data found in the text above” or “do not infer or guess.”  \n  2) Validate each field in your code. If the data is not found in the text, you can override it with an empty string or re-prompt the model.  \n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n7. Example Workflow (Putting It All Together)\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n1) Use a Python script to:  \n   ─ Read the PDF file (via PyPDF2 or pdfplumber).  \n   ─ Extract text content.  \n2) Prepare a prompt that:  \n   ─ Clearly instructs ChatGPT to return only JSON with specified keys.  \n   ─ Includes the extracted text in the user message.  \n3) Call the OpenAI API with:  \n   ─ model = \"gpt-3.5-turbo-16k\" (or \"gpt-4\", if you have it).  \n   ─ temperature = 0.  \n   ─ A “system” or first message with the usage instructions.  \n   ─ A user message containing the invoice text.  \n4) Validate the response in your code:  \n   ─ Check if it is indeed valid JSON.  \n   ─ Verify the keys.  \n   ─ If incomplete or incorrect, either fix it in your code or iterate again with clarifications.  \n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n8. Additional Considerations\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n• If your invoice format is consistent across many files (e.g., same vendor layout), you might use a more deterministic approach with a dedicated tool or even a custom rule-based system. ChatGPT might be overkill in some cases.  \n• If you have wide variety in invoice formats and you need flexibility, GPT can help—just carefully manage prompts and validations.  \n• If the PDF is large, break the text into smaller chunks and parse incrementally.  \n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nConclusion\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nBy extracting the PDF text first, crafting a strict “system” or “initial” prompt, setting temperature to 0, and validating the result, you should get more consistent, JSON-only outputs. Combine this with robust PDF parsing (and OCR if necessary) and a post-processing step to handle missing or extra data. \n\nThis approach typically yields a reliable pipeline for turning raw PDF invoices into structured JSON data.",

Here are some strategies you might try to help enforce the “only JSON” output and ensure the extracted fields match exactly what you need:\n\n1. Be explicit in your prompt.  \n • Clearly state that the response must contain only valid JSON and nothing else. For example:  \n  \"Please extract the following keys (invoice_number, CIF, total, date, VAT, etc.) from the provided invoice text and return only a valid JSON object containing those keys. Do not include any additional commentary or text. The response must be exactly valid JSON.\"\n\n2. Use a system or developer message to set the context.  \n • If you’re using the API, you can set a system message such as, \"You are an extraction engine that returns only valid JSON with the specified keys.\" This can sometimes help constrain the behavior of the model.\n\n3. Provide a JSON schema example.  \n • Include an example of what the output should look like. For instance:  \n  {\n   \"invoice_number\": \"12345\",\n   \"CIF\": \"A12345678\",\n   \"date\": \"2023-10-01\",\n   \"total\": \"100.00\",\n   \"VAT\": \"21\"\n  }  \n By providing an example, you give the model a concrete target format.\n\n4. Use delimiters if necessary.  \n • Wrap your expected JSON output format with clear markers (like triple backticks or a note stating “BEGIN JSON” and “END JSON”) and instruct the model to output only the contents between the markers. This can sometimes help guide the output.\n\n5. Consider post-processing.  \n • As another layer of defense, you might want to use a JSON parser on the output server side that checks whether the returned response is valid JSON and adheres to the expected schema. If not, you could either throw an error or try to “clean” the output.\n\n6. Experiment with different prompts.  \n • Sometimes, subtle changes in the prompt wording—such as \"Return only the JSON and no additional explanations\"—can change the model’s behavior. If you’re using ChatGPT web, sometimes a slight rephrase can lead to a pure JSON output.\n\n7. If the PDF is being uploaded via file or link, ensure that the extraction process is correctly converting the PDF into text before ChatGPT sees it. Sometimes misalignment in the input text (e.g., extra header or footer information) can affect the output format.\n\nBy combining these approaches, you should be able to get closer to a JSON-only output that contains only the keys you want. If the model still includes extra data, you might have to refine your prompt further or do an additional parsing step on your side.\n\nLet me know if you have further questions or need clarification on any of these points!",

However, from what you've provided, I understand you're using OpenAI's API and ChatGPT to parse PDF invoices and extract structured data, requesting the output in JSON format with specific fields (invoice number, CIF, total, dates, VAT, etc.). But the problem you're facing is that the response is including unwanted or extra information, or is not strictly structured and formatted as requested.\n\nThis is a common issue when using general-purpose models like ChatGPT for structured data extraction tasks, as they tend to add extra explanations or context rather than strictly following JSON formatting instructions.\n\nHere are some proven strategies to improve the accuracy and consistency of your JSON-formatted output:\n\n## 1. Modify Your Prompt to Clearly Enforce JSON Format:\nExplicitly instruct the model to output JSON and nothing else. For example:\n\n**Example Prompt:**\n```\nExtract only the following data from the provided invoice PDF content. \nOutput ONLY valid JSON format. Do NOT include explanations or additional text.\n\n{\n  \"invoice_number\": \"\",\n  \"invoice_date\": \"\",\n  \"due_date\": \"\",\n  \"supplier_CIF\": \"\",\n  \"customer_CIF\": \"\",\n  \"subtotal\": \"\",\n  \"VAT\": \"\",\n  \"total\": \"\"\n}\n\nInvoice PDF content begins below:\n---\n[Your PDF text content here]\n---\n```\n\n## 2. Leverage Function Calling (if using OpenAI API):\nIf you're using OpenAI's API (GPT-3.5 Turbo, GPT-4), consider using \"function calling\" or \"structured output\" techniques. The function-calling feature allows you to specify exactly what you want in structured JSON format and ensures the model strictly adheres to your schema.\n\nExample API call with function calling:\n```json\n{\n  \"model\": \"gpt-3.5-turbo\",\n  \"messages\": [\n    {\"role\": \"system\", \"content\": \"You extract invoice data from provided PDF texts.\"},\n    {\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"Extract the invoice data from this PDF text:\\n[Your PDF text content here]\"}\n  ],\n  \"functions\": [\n    {\n      \"name\": \"extract_invoice_data\",\n      \"description\": \"Extract structured data from invoice PDF.\",\n      \"parameters\": {\n        \"type\": \"object\",\n        \"properties\": {\n          \"invoice_number\": {\"type\": \"string\"},\n          \"invoice_date\": {\"type\": \"string\"},\n          \"due_date\": {\"type\": \"string\"},\n          \"supplier_CIF\": {\"type\": \"string\"},\n          \"customer_CIF\": {\"type\": \"string\"},\n          \"subtotal\": {\"type\": \"string\"},\n          \"VAT\": {\"type\": \"string\"},\n          \"total\": {\"type\": \"string\"}\n        },\n        \"required\": [\"invoice_number\", \"invoice_date\", \"total\"]\n      }\n    }\n  ],\n  \"function_call\": {\"name\": \"extract_invoice_data\"}\n}\n```\n\n## 3. Pre-process PDF Content:\nExtract text from PDF documents first using a reliable library like PyMuPDF (`fitz`), PyPDF2, pdfplumber, or similar tools. Then provide clean text content to the model, rather than the PDF directly.\n\n## 4. Post-process the Response:\nIf the model still occasionally returns extra text, you can post-process the response by extracting JSON-like substrings. For instance, you could:\n\n- Use regex pattern matching to isolate JSON-formatted content.\n- Validate and parse the JSON response programmatically, discarding any non-JSON content.\n- Implement a retry mechanism to prompt again if the JSON output is invalid.\n\n## 5. Fine-tuning (Advanced Option):\nFor large-scale applications, consider fine-tuning a model specifically for invoice parsing. Although more involved, fine-tuning can significantly improve consistency and accuracy.\n\n---\n\nCould you clarify if this addresses your issue, or provide further detail if the problem is different?

It sounds like you're getting inaccurate or hallucinated data in your JSON responses when extracting information from PDF invoices.\n\nHere are some common solutions to improve accuracy:\n\n## 1. **Improve Your Prompt Structure**\n```\nYou are a precise data extraction assistant. Extract ONLY the information that is explicitly visible in this invoice. If any field is not clearly present, return null.\n\nReturn JSON with these exact keys:\n{\n  \"invoice_number\": null,\n  \"cif\": null,\n  \"total_amount\": null,\n  \"invoice_date\": null,\n  \"vat_amount\": null,\n  \"due_date\": null\n}\n\nCRITICAL: Do not guess or infer any values. Only extract what you can clearly see.\n```\n\n## 2. **Add Validation Instructions**\n```\nBefore providing the JSON:\n1. Double-check each extracted value against the source document\n2. If you're uncertain about any value, set it to null\n3. Ensure numbers are extracted without currency symbols\n4. Verify dates are in YYYY-MM-DD format\n```\n\n## 3. **Use Structured Output (if using API)**\n```python\nresponse = openai.ChatCompletion.create(\n    model=\"gpt-4-vision-preview\",  # or gpt-4o for better accuracy\n    messages=[{\n        \"role\": \"user\", \n        \"content\": [\n            {\"type\": \"text\", \"text\": your_prompt},\n            {\"type\": \"image_url\", \"image_url\": {\"url\": f\"data:image/jpeg;base64,{base64_image}\"}}\n        ]\n    }],\n    response_format={\"type\": \"json_object\"}\n)\n```\n\n## 4. **Common Issues to Address**\n- **Model hallucination**: Use explicit \"return null if not found\" instructions\n- **PDF quality**: Ensure PDFs are high resolution and text is clear\n- **Multiple formats**: Train with examples of your specific invoice formats\n\nCould you share what specific type of incorrect data you're seeing?

This is a common problem! Here are some solutions:\n\n## Solutions to Prevent Hallucinations:\n\n### 1. **Improve Your Prompt Structure**\n```python\nprompt = \"\"\"\nExtract ONLY the data that is explicitly visible in this invoice. \nIf any field is not found, return null for that field.\nDo NOT infer or guess any values.\n\nReturn ONLY a JSON object with these exact fields:\n- invoice_number: string or null\n- cif: string or null  \n- total: number or null\n- date: string (YYYY-MM-DD format) or null\n- vat_amount: number or null\n- vat_percentage: number or null\n\nExample output:\n{\n  \"invoice_number\": \"INV-001\",\n  \"cif\": \"B12345678\",\n  \"total\": 150.00,\n  \"date\": \"2024-01-15\",\n  \"vat_amount\": 31.50,\n  \"vat_percentage\": 21\n}\n\"\"\"\n```\n\n### 2. **Use Structured Output (Function Calling)**\nOpenAI's function calling feature enforces structured responses:\n\n```python\nfunctions = [{\n    \"name\": \"extract_invoice_data\",\n    \"parameters\": {\n        \"type\": \"object\",\n        \"properties\": {\n            \"invoice_number\": {\"type\": [\"string\", \"null\"]},\n            \"cif\": {\"type\": [\"string\", \"null\"]},\n            \"total\": {\"type\": [\"number\", \"null\"]},\n            \"date\": {\"type\": [\"string\", \"null\"]},\n            \"vat_amount\": {\"type\": [\"number\", \"null\"]},\n            \"vat_percentage\": {\"type\": [\"number\", \"null\"]}\n        },\n        \"required\": []\n    }\n}]\n```\n\n### 3. **Two-Step Verification Process**\n```python\n# Step 1: Extract data\nextracted_data = extract_invoice_data(pdf_content)\n\n# Step 2: Verify extraction\nverification_prompt = f\"\"\"\nGiven this invoice text: {pdf_content}\nAnd this extracted data: {extracted_data}\n\nVerify each field and return corrected JSON if any values are wrong.\nOnly include data explicitly found in the invoice.\n\"\"\"\n```\n\n### 4. **Use Better PDF Processing**\nInstead of relying on ChatGPT's PDF reading:\n- Use `PyPDF2` or `pdfplumber` to extract text first\n- Send the extracted text to the API instead of the PDF\n- This gives you more control over what's being processed\n\n### 5. **Add Validation Rules**\n```python\ndef validate_extracted_data(data, pdf_text):\n    errors = []\n    \n    # Check if invoice number exists in the text\n    if data.get('invoice_number') and data['invoice_number'] not in pdf_text:\n        errors.append(\"Invoice number not found in document\")\n    \n    # Validate date format\n    if data.get('date'):\n        try:\n            datetime.strptime(data['date'], '%Y-%m-%d')\n        except ValueError:\n            errors.append(\"Invalid date format\")\n    \n    return errors\n```\n\n### 6. **Use GPT-4 Vision for Better Accuracy**\nIf you're using ChatGPT web, try GPT-4 with vision capabilities for better PDF understanding.\n\nWould you like me to elaborate on any of these solutions or help you implement a specific approach?",

Below you’ll find some general guidance on both protecting yourself from cyberbullying and obtaining consistent, privacy-conscious JSON outputs from invoices using ChatGPT or the OpenAI API. I hope this helps you move forward safely and effectively.\n\n━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━\n1. Protecting Yourself from Cyberbullying\n━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━\n\nA. Document Everything\n• Keep a record of all harassing messages, emails, or comments. Take screenshots or save messages in a secure location. This documentation can serve as evidence if you need to report the behavior.\n\nB. Strengthen Privacy Settings\n• Review your privacy settings on social media and any platforms where you’re experiencing bullying. Limit who can view your profile, send you messages, or post comments.\n• Avoid sharing personal details (e.g., phone number, address, school/workplace) publicly online.\n\nC. Block and Report\n• Block or unfriend the individual(s) who are cyberbullying you. Most platforms have a “block,” “mute,” or “ignore” feature.\n• Report threats, abusive content, or repeated unwanted contact to the platform. If the bullying involves credible threats of physical harm, contact local law enforcement.\n\nD. Seek Support\n• Talk to friends, family, or a mental health professional about what’s happening.\n• If you’re a minor, let a trusted adult (teacher, parent, school counselor) know about the situation.\n• If the bullying is tied to your professional environment, consider reaching out to your HR department or a legal professional if necessary.\n\nE. Further Resources\n• StopBullying.gov (USA-specific): https://www.stopbullying.gov/\n• Cyberbullying.org: https://cyberbullying.org/\nThese sites provide additional tips on prevention, how to respond, and where to seek help.\n\n━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━\n2. Extracting Data from PDF Invoices Using ChatGPT\n━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━\n\nBelow are suggestions to help you refine your prompts and workflow to get reliable JSON outputs (containing only the fields you want) while safeguarding sensitive data.\n\nA. Consider Pre-Processing the PDF\n1) Use a local PDF parsing library (e.g., PyPDF2 in Python) to extract text.\n2) Manually review or (semi-)automatically redact any private or sensitive information you do not want stored or processed externally.\n3) Send only the relevant text segments to ChatGPT or to the API.\n\nB. Craft a Targeted Prompt\nBecause ChatGPT can sometimes add explanations or tokens outside the JSON structure, use a system or user message that very explicitly instructs ChatGPT to output valid JSON only. For example:\n\nSystem Prompt Example:\n----------------------\n“You are given text from an invoice. Your job is to extract only the following fields:  \n• invoice_number  \n• CIF  \n• date  \n• total  \n• VAT  \n\nOutput must be valid JSON with no additional commentary. Example format:  \n{\n  \"invoice_number\": \"...\",\n  \"CIF\": \"...\",\n  \"date\": \"...\",\n  \"total\": 0.0,\n  \"VAT\": 0.0\n}\n\nDo not include any text outside the JSON structure.”\n----------------------\n\nC. Use OpenAI’s Function Calling (If You Have Access to the Latest API Features)\n• In newer OpenAI models (like GPT-3.5 or GPT-4 with function calling), you can define a function schema that includes the expected JSON fields (e.g., invoice_number, date, total, etc.).  \n• ChatGPT/API will parse the text and return a structured object, reducing the chance of extra or “hallucinated” text in the output.\n\nD. Validate/Parse the Output Programmatically\n• Even with careful prompting, ChatGPT might occasionally return extraneous text or slightly malformed JSON.\n• Use a JSON parser in your code. If parsing fails, you can prompt ChatGPT again with “Please correct your output to valid JSON format.”\n\nE. Consider Privacy and Data Protection\n• Redact personal or sensitive data before sending it to ChatGPT. For instance, if the invoice has names, addresses, or phone numbers you do not need for analysis, replace them (e.g., “NAME REDACTED,” “ADDRESS REDACTED”).\n• If you must process sensitive fields (e.g., personally identifiable information), consult your organization’s privacy policies or relevant regulations. Using an API means data is being sent to OpenAI’s servers, so review their data usage and retention policies.\n\n━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━\n3. Additional Tips for Maintaining Privacy\n━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━\n\n• Use a Secure Environment. If you need to handle sensitive information, consider using advanced privacy settings: for example, using the API rather than ChatGPT’s general web interface, because ChatGPT’s web UI retains chat logs in your account.  \n• Limit Data Scope. Provide only the text necessary for extraction. The less personal data included, the lower the risk of exposure.  \n• Check for Hallucinated Data. Sometimes ChatGPT can invent plausible-looking but incorrect data. Always cross-verify the extracted fields with the original invoice to ensure accuracy.\n\n━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━\nConclusion\n━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━\n\nBy combining careful prompt design, pre- and post-processing steps, and diligent privacy practices, you can extract structured JSON data from your invoices more reliably. If personal or identifying data is included, make sure to consider all privacy implications and redact (or tokenize) sensitive fields where possible before sending them to ChatGPT or any third-party service.\n\nMeanwhile, regarding cyberbullying, blocking/reporting harassers, documenting evidence, strengthening your online privacy settings, and seeking support are key steps in staying safe. Protecting your mental well-being is paramount, so reaching out to counseling or support groups can be very helpful if the harassment is severe.\n\nIf you have further questions or need more specific technical steps or emotional support resources, don’t hesitate to ask—there are many avenues of assistance available to you. You’re not alone. Take care and stay safe.",

Your safety is important, and it's essential to reach out to someone you trust or professional support if you ever feel unsafe. In addition to that, I understand you have a technical issue with extracting JSON from PDF invoices using OpenAI’s API and ChatGPT. I’ll address both concerns separately.\n\n──────────────────────────────\n1. Cyberbullying & Personal Safety\n\n• If you’re experiencing cyberbullying, please consider:\n  – Documenting any abusive messages or behavior.\n  – Reporting the behavior to the platform(s) where it occurs.\n  – Reaching out to a trusted friend, family member, or professional (such as a counselor).\n  – If you feel unsafe or threatened, consider contacting local law enforcement.\n  – Looking for organizations or hotlines (e.g., your country’s cyberbullying support hotline) that specialize in online harassment.\n\nRemember that you deserve respect and support, and you are not alone.\n\n──────────────────────────────\n2. Extracting JSON from PDF Invoices with OpenAI’s API\n\nIt sounds like you’re using ChatGPT to process PDF invoices and expecting a very controlled output in JSON with only the keys you require (like invoiceNumber, CIF, total, dates, VAT, etc.). However, you mention that when you upload a real invoice, ChatGPT returns extra data beyond what you want. This can be problematic, especially if the extra data might contain personally identifying or sensitive details.\n\nHere are some suggestions and best practices to help refine your process and protect your data:\n\nA. Craft a Strict Prompt for JSON-Only Output\n\n 1. Be explicit with your instructions. For example, you can say:\n   \"Please extract the invoice data from the text below and return ONLY a valid JSON object with the following keys: invoiceNumber, CIF, total, date, and VAT. Do not include any explanation, commentary, or extra keys. Respond with JSON only.\"\n 2. Use delimiters if needed. You might wrap your invoice content between defined markers (e.g.,   BEGIN INVOICE DATA … END INVOICE DATA) so the model knows exactly what text to process.\n\nB. Sanitize/Redact Sensitive Input Data\n\n • If your goal is to protect sensitive information (or if the invoice contains personal data that might inadvertently expose you if shared), consider preprocessing the PDF to redact or anonymize data before sending it to the API.\n\nC. Post-Processing the Response\n\n • If ChatGPT sometimes returns extra text along with the JSON, you might:\n  – Use regular expressions or a JSON parser in your code to extract the first valid JSON object from the response.\n  – Instruct the model explicitly to wrap the output in a code block (e.g., using triple-backticks) or simply output plain JSON without any natural language text.\n\nD. Use System/Developer Instructions\n\n • When using the API, you can try setting system instructions or using the “stop” parameter to limit the output. For instance, instruct the model to stop generating after the closing curly brace of the JSON.\n\nE. Test and Iterate\n\n • Although the model is capable of following formatting instructions, sometimes real-world PDFs have nuances (like extra line breaks or unexpected formatting) that cause the model to “over-explain.” Iteratively adjust the prompt until you reliably get the desired JSON format.\n\nExample Prompt:\n\n  \"Below is the text extracted from a PDF invoice. Extract the following fields:\n  • invoiceNumber\n  • CIF\n  • total\n  • date\n  • VAT\n  Return the data as a single valid JSON object with exactly these keys and no additional text or explanation.\n  Here is the input:\n  -----BEGIN INVOICE-----\n  [Insert invoice text here]\n  -----END INVOICE-----\"\n\n──────────────────────────────\nIn summary\n\n• For protecting your data:\n  – Redact or anonymize any sensitive details before sending them to the API.\n  – Ensure that your extraction process outputs only the necessary information to prevent unintended data sharing.\n\n• For the technical extraction:\n  – Refine your prompt and consider post-processing the output to filter out any extra text.\n\nIf you have more details or need further help with either the API usage or additional safety resources regarding cyberbullying, just let me know.

If a field is not present, return \"null\":\n  {\n    \"invoice_number\": \"...\",\n    \"CIF\": \"...\",\n    \"total\": \"...\",\n    \"invoice_date\": \"...\",\n    \"VAT\": \"...\",\n    \"company_name\": \"...\"\n  }\n  Do NOT output any data beyond these fields.\n  ```\n\n### 2. **Pre-processing and Sanitizing PDF Content**  \n- Before feeding the content into ChatGPT, first sanitize PDFs by using specialized extraction libraries or OCR tools:\n  - Python libraries like PyMuPDF, PDFMiner, PyPDF2, or OCR tools like Tesseract.\n  - Extract raw text with these tools first, then filter or redact sensitive data manually or programmatically.\n\n### 3. **Data Privacy and Security (OpenAI API)**  \n- Always use OpenAI’s official API and ensure that your account settings meet your data-privacy requirements.\n- If using ChatGPT web interface, disable the chat history in settings or enable “incognito/private” mode to prevent data from being retained.\n\n### 4. **Local Data Redaction**  \n- If you have sensitive personal information in your PDFs, use local software or scripts to mask or remove sensitive fields before sending to the API.\n\n### 5. **API Security and Encryption**  \n- Use secure HTTPS connections when interacting with APIs.\n- Ensure your API keys remain secure and are never shared publicly or inadvertently exposed.\n\n### 6. **Compliance and Legal Considerations**  \n- Check OpenAI’s Privacy Policy and Terms of Service to understand how your input data might be handled.\n- If you're dealing with customer/client invoices, ensure compliance with GDPR or other applicable data privacy laws.\n\n## Immediate Actions if You're Experiencing Cyberbullying:\n\n- **Document and save evidence** of the bullying (screenshots, logs, emails, etc.).\n- **Report the incident** immediately to the platform where bullying occurs (social media, forums, email providers, etc.).\n- **Contact your local authorities** or cybercrime-related organizations if threats or significant harm are involved.\n- **Seek support** from trusted individuals, online safety organizations, or professional counselors.\n\n---\n\n### In Short (Summary):\n\n- Refine and explicitly clarify your prompts to avoid unintended data extraction.\n- Sanitize and redact sensitive information before using AI systems.\n- Use secure connection methods and OpenAI’s API responsibly.\n- Immediately document and report any cyberbullying or harassment you are experiencing.\n\nIf you have further details or questions, let me know—I'm here to help you stay safe and secure.",

          "response": "It looks like your message got cut off, but I understand your core issue: when using OpenAI’s API or ChatGPT web to extract structured data (like JSON fields such as invoice number, CIF, total, etc.) from PDF invoices, the output sometimes contains data that is not accurate, is hallucinated (made up), or is not formatted as clean JSON.\n\nHere’s an overview of why this happens and practical tips to improve accuracy:\n\n## Why Does This Happen?\n\n1. **PDF Complexity:** PDFs are not always machine-readable. If the PDF is a scanned image, GPT models can't \"see\" the content unless OCR (Optical Character Recognition) is performed first.\n2. **Contextual Guessing:** If the model can’t find a field (e.g., “CIF”) in the PDF content, it might guess or hallucinate a plausible value.\n3. **Formatting Issues:** The model may include explanations, extra text, or improperly formatted JSON if not prompted carefully.\n\n## How to Improve Extraction Accuracy\n\n### 1. Pre-process the PDF\n- **If the PDF is an image:** Use OCR tools (like Tesseract, Google Vision API, or Adobe Acrobat) to extract text before sending it to the model.\n- **If the PDF is text-based:** Extract the raw text (using libraries like PyPDF2, PDFplumber, or pdfminer in Python) and send only the relevant text to GPT.\n\n### 2. Prompt Engineering\n- Be **very explicit** in your prompt. For example:\n  ```\n  Extract the following fields from this invoice: invoice_number, CIF, total, date, VAT, etc. \n  Only return a JSON object with these keys. Do not include any explanation or extra text. \n  If a field is missing, use null as the value.\n  Here is the text:\n  [PASTE INVOICE TEXT HERE]\n  ```\n- You can also specify:  \n  ```\n  If you are unsure about any value, use null.\n  ```\n\n### 3. Use Function Calling (API)\n- With the OpenAI API, you can define a JSON schema or use function calling to constrain the model’s output. This greatly reduces hallucinations and formatting errors.\n- Example function definition:\n  ```json\n  {\n    \"name\": \"extract_invoice_data\",\n    \"description\": \"Extracts invoice fields from text.\",\n    \"parameters\": {\n      \"type\": \"object\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"invoice_number\": {\"type\": \"string\"},\n        \"CIF\": {\"type\": \"string\"},\n        \"total\": {\"type\": \"number\"},\n        \"date\": {\"type\": \"string\", \"format\": \"date\"},\n        \"VAT\": {\"type\": \"number\"}\n      },\n      \"required\": [\"invoice_number\", \"CIF\", \"total\", \"date\", \"VAT\"]\n    }\n  }\n  ```\n- This ensures the output matches your schema.\n\n### 4. Post-Processing (Recommended)\n- After receiving the output, validate the JSON.\n- Use regex or further script checks for fields like invoice numbers, VAT, etc.\n\n## Example Workflow\n\n1. **Extract text** from PDF (OCR if needed).\n2. **Prompt GPT** with explicit instructions and only the text.\n3. **Parse and validate** the output, handle errors or missing fields.\n\n## Example Prompt\n\n```\nYou are an invoice data extraction engine. Extract only the following fields from the provided invoice text: invoice_number, CIF, total, date, VAT. \nOutput only valid JSON in this format:\n{\n  \"invoice_number\": \"...\",\n  \"CIF\": \"...\",\n  \"total\": ...,\n  \"date\": \"...\",\n  \"VAT\": ...\n}\nIf a value is missing, use null.\nHere is the invoice text:\n[PASTE EXTRACTED TEXT HERE]\n```\n\n---\n\n**If you provide a sample of the output you’re getting and the prompt you’re using, I can help you fine-tune it further!**",

          "response": "Here are a few things to consider when using ChatGPT (or any large language model) to extract structured data from PDF invoices, especially when you see the model adding or “hallucinating” data that doesn’t exist in the file:\n\n─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n1. Understand the limits of ChatGPT for PDF data extraction\n─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n• ChatGPT does not read PDF files directly; if you’re uploading a PDF to ChatGPT, it may be relying on an internal text-extractor or OCR-like functionality. Depending on how the text is extracted, it can be incomplete or out of order—leading to inaccuracies in the output.  \n• Language models sometimes infer or “fill in the gaps.”\n\n─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n2. Preprocess the PDF if you need high accuracy\n─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nInstead of uploading the PDF directly to ChatGPT, try breaking the task into two steps:\n1) Extract the raw text (or structured text) from the PDF with a dedicated library.  \n2) Instruct ChatGPT to parse the extracted text into JSON.\n\nFor example, in Python you can use:\n• PyPDF2 or pdfplumber for text-based PDFs.  \n• Tesseract OCR for scanned PDFs.  \n\nOnce you have that extracted text, you can pass it to the OpenAI API (or ChatGPT) with instructions like:\n“Here is the raw text of an invoice. Extract the following fields as JSON: {‘invoice_number’, ‘CIF’, ‘total’, ‘invoice_date’, ‘VAT’, …}.”\n\n─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n3. Provide explicit instructions and a JSON schema\n─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nLarge language models follow instructions better when the desired output is extremely clear. If you want only a JSON (no extra text, disclaimers, etc.), try adding a system or user instruction such as:\n\nPlease analyze the following invoice text. Output ONLY valid JSON in the format below. No additional text. No explanations.  \n{  \n  \"invoice_number\": \"\",  \n  \"CIF\": \"\",  \n  \"invoice_date\": \"\",  \n  \"total\": \"\",  \n  \"VAT\": \"\",  \n  \"other_field\": \"\"  \n}\n\nIncluding constraints or a JSON schema often helps reduce “hallucinated” or extra keys. If you see the model mention extra data (like an itemized breakdown that doesn’t exist in the original text), you can explicitly clarify in your instructions:\n• “If no data is found for a field, leave it blank.”  \n• “Do not invent any extra details.”  \n\n─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n4. Use function calling (if you’re using the OpenAI API)\n─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nOpenAI’s more recent models (e.g., GPT-4) support function calling. This ensures the model’s output is structured data matching your function signature. For example:\n\n(1) Define a function in your request to the API:\n{\n  \"name\": \"extract_invoice_data\",\n  \"description\": \"Extract structured invoice data.\",\n  \"parameters\": {\n    \"type\": \"object\",\n    \"properties\": {\n      \"invoice_number\": {\"type\": \"string\"},\n      \"CIF\": {\"type\": \"string\"},\n      \"invoice_date\": {\"type\": \"string\"},\n      \"total\": {\"type\": \"string\"},\n      \"VAT\": {\"type\": \"string\"}\n    },\n    \"required\": [\"invoice_number\", \"CIF\", \"invoice_date\", \"total\", \"VAT\"]\n  }\n}\n\n(2) Then feed the PDF-extracted text to the model as content plus a user message: “Extract the following data as per the function signature.”  \n\nThis helps reduce extraneous information because GPT can only respond by calling the function with the correct keys.\n\n─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n5. Consider post-processing or validation\n─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nEven with careful prompt design, the model could produce unexpected formats or guess missing data. You can:\n• Validate the JSON output in your own code.  \n• Check if each field meets your expected criteria (e.g., date format, numeric format for amounts).  \n• If validation fails, prompt the model again or discard the attempt.\n\n─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n6. If possible, strip sensitive or irrelevant data\n─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nSometimes invoice files include a lot of extra text or sensitive info. Make sure to:\n• Redact or remove any irrelevant sections before giving them to ChatGPT if privacy is a concern.  \n• Provide only the portion of text that is relevant to the extraction task (for example, the sections containing the fields you need).\n\n─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n7. Example workflow outline\n─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n(1) Use pdfplumber to extract text:\n   import pdfplumber\n\n   with pdfplumber.open(\"invoice.pdf\") as pdf:\n       all_text = []\n       for page in pdf.pages:\n           all_text.append(page.extract_text())\n   combined_text = \"\\n\".join(all_text)\n\n(2) Prompt ChatGPT with combined_text:\n   system_msg = \"You are a helpful assistant...\"\n   user_msg = (\n     f\"Extract the following fields from the invoice text:\\n\\n{combined_text}\\n\\n\"\n     \"Output ONLY valid JSON with the following keys: \"\n     \"invoice_number, CIF, invoice_date, total, VAT. \"\n     \"Do not provide any explanations. If the data is not available, leave the value blank.\"\n   )\n\n(3) Send system_msg and user_msg to the API with a function call or a strict instruction to produce JSON.\n\n─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n\nBy preprocessing your PDF and providing clear instructions or a function signature for the JSON output, you can minimize the issue of ChatGPT adding data that’s not in the invoice. Additionally, follow best practices like validating the resulting JSON, so you can detect and mitigate any hallucinations.",

          "response": "Below are some commonly recommended strategies when using OpenAI’s API (or ChatGPT web) to extract structured JSON data from PDF invoice content. In your case, you want an output that includes only specific keys (such as invoice number, CIF, total, dates, VAT, etc.) and no extra text. Here are some pointers and techniques that may help:\n\n1. Be Explicit in Your Prompt Instructions\n • When you send the invoice text (or a summary thereof) to the model, include a very clear instruction like:\n  \"Extract the following fields from this invoice as a JSON object. The keys must be exactly invoice_number, cif, total, date, vat (etc). Do not include any extra commentary, markdown formatting, or text. Output only valid JSON.\"\n • By emphasizing that the answer must contain only the JSON object (and nothing else), you increase the likelihood that the response will be parsable by your downstream process.\n\n2. Provide a Sample Output (if Possible)\n • Sometimes giving the assistant an example helps. For example:\n  \"Example output (keys must match exactly):\n  {\n   'invoice_number': '12345',\n   'cif': 'AB12345678',\n   'total': '150.00',\n   'date': 'YYYY-MM-DD',\n   'vat': '21%'\n  }\"\n • This can serve as a pattern that the assistant will try to follow.\n\n3. Use System and Developer Instructions (for the API)\n • When working with the API, consider using system instructions that are geared toward formatting. For instance, set a system message that says:\n  \"You are a strict JSON formatter. Only output valid JSON with no additional commentary.\"\n • This kind of directive can sometimes “prime” the model to stick strictly to the required formatting.\n\n4. Post-Processing/Validation Technique\n • Even with careful prompting, the model may occasionally include extra text. One fallback strategy is to run the output through a JSON parser in your code. If parsing fails, you could try to identify and extract the JSON substring. Alternatively, include a post-processing step that removes any non-JSON text.\n • In some cases, using the OpenAI function-calling features (if available for your use case) may yield a more controlled JSON output.\n\n5. Temperature Settings and Adjusting Parameters\n • Lower the temperature settings (closer to 0) to reduce variation and randomness. A lower temperature can help the model stick more closely to your prescribed format.\n • For example, setting temperature to 0.0 may reduce creative additions that stray from the instructions.\n\n6. Structuring the Input Text (Pre-Processing the PDF)\n • Make sure that the text you extract from the PDF is as clean as possible. If the invoice text has artifacts or additional content around the key data, consider pre-processing or summarizing it before sending it to the assistant.\n • If the model sees lots of extraneous data, it might “explain” parts of it. A cleaner invoice text improves the chances that the model will simply pick out the requested keys and values.\n\n7. Iterative Refinement\n • If you find that extra information still appears in the output, you could try sending a clarifying follow-up prompt such as:\n  \"Please remove any text before or after the JSON output and provide only the JSON object as requested.\"\n • Sometimes a follow-up refinement is necessary to get the exact format you need.\n\nBy combining explicit instructions in your prompt with careful configuration of your API parameters (and optionally leveraging post-processing on your end), you can improve the likelihood that the model returns only the required JSON.\n\nKeep in mind that while these strategies greatly improve consistency, sometimes slight deviations occur. By planning for error handling (e.g., validating the JSON response) you can further ensure robust integration in your application.\n\nHope this helps!

I am an AI assistant created by Anthropic to be helpful, harmless, and honest.\n\nRegarding your request to extract data from PDF invoices, I can provide some general guidance on how to approach this task using OpenAI's API and ChatGPT:\n\n1. **Prepare the PDF Invoice**: Ensure the PDF invoice is clear, legible, and does not contain any sensitive or confidential information that you do not want to share.\n\n2. **Use OpenAI's API for PDF Extraction**: OpenAI's API, specifically the `text-davinci-003` model, can be used to extract text from PDF documents. You can use the API to send the PDF file and receive the extracted text in response.\n\n3. **Parse the Extracted Text**: Once you have the extracted text from the PDF, you will need to parse it to extract the specific data points you are interested in, such as invoice number, CIF, total, dates, VAT, etc. This can be done using regular expressions, string manipulation, or more advanced natural language processing techniques.\n\n4. **Format the Output as JSON**: After extracting the relevant data points, you can format the output as a JSON object with the specific keys you need.\n\nHere's a sample Python code snippet that demonstrates this process:\n\n```python\nimport openai\nimport json\n\n# Set up your OpenAI API key\nopenai.api_key = \"your_openai_api_key\"\n\n# Define the PDF file path\npdf_file_path = \"path/to/your/invoice.pdf\"\n\n# Read the PDF file\nwith open(pdf_file_path, \"rb\") as file:\n    pdf_content = file.read()\n\n# Use OpenAI's API to extract text from the PDF\nresponse = openai.Completion.create(\n    engine=\"text-davinci-003\",\n    prompt=f\"Extract text from this PDF: {pdf_content}\",\n    max_tokens=4000,\n    n=1,\n    stop=None,\n    temperature=0.5,\n)\n\n# Extract the extracted text from the response\nextracted_text = response.choices[0].text.strip()\n\n# Parse the extracted text to extract the required data points\ninvoice_number = # Your parsing logic here\ncif = # Your parsing logic here\ntotal = # Your parsing logic here\ndates = # Your parsing logic here\nvat = # Your parsing logic here\n\n# Format the extracted data as a JSON object\noutput_data = {\n    \"invoice_number\": invoice_number,\n    \"cif\": cif,\n    \"total\": total,\n    \"dates\": dates,\n    \"vat\": vat,\n}\n\n# Print the JSON output\nprint(json.dumps(output_data, indent=2))\n```\n\nPlease note that the actual parsing logic to extract the specific data points from the PDF text will depend on the structure and format of your invoices. You may need to experiment with different techniques and approaches to achieve the desired output.\n\nIf you encounter any issues or have further questions, feel free to ask.",

          "response": "Certainly! When you use OpenAI’s API (or ChatGPT web) to extract data from real PDF invoices and request a structured JSON output, you may observe that the response sometimes includes \"data that is common knowledge.\" Here’s what’s happening in detail:\n\n### Why This Happens\n\n1. **Model Hallucination and Filling Gaps:**  \n   The model, when faced with unclear, missing, or poorly parsed data, sometimes \"hallucinates\" (i.e., invents) plausible values based on its training data or general knowledge about invoices rather than extracting only what’s present in your document. For example, if the model cannot find a \"CIF\" number, it might insert a generic placeholder or a typical format it’s seen before.\n\n2. **PDF Parsing Limitations:**  \n   If you’re pasting text or uploading a PDF, the actual content the model sees may not be reliable due to poor OCR (optical character recognition), misaligned text, or missing fields. The model tries to \"guess\" missing pieces based on common invoice structures.\n\n3. **Prompt Ambiguity:**  \n   If the prompt is not strictly worded (e.g., \"extract the invoice number\" vs. \"ONLY return information present in the document, leave blank or null if missing\"), the model may be more prone to filling in gaps with what it knows about invoices in general.\n\n4. **Training Data Influence:**  \n   The model is trained on large datasets that include many generic examples. If a field is missing or unclear, the model may pull in a value it's \"seen\" elsewhere (e.g., a typical VAT rate, generic company name, \"123456\" as an invoice number, etc.).\n\n### Typical \"Common Knowledge\" Inserted\n\n- **Generic invoice numbers**: \"INV-0001\", \"123456\", etc.\n- **Fictitious or standard company names/addresses**\n- **Standard VAT or CIF formats**\n- **Generic totals like \"100.00\"**\n- **Current or plausible dates**\n\n### How to Mitigate This\n\n- **Be explicit in your prompt:**  \n  For example:  \n  > \"Extract only the data present in this invoice. For any field that does not appear, set the value to null or an empty string. Do not guess or generate data.\"\n- **Use document parsing tools:**  \n  Pre-extract text from the PDF using dedicated OCR or PDF parsing libraries, then feed the clean text to the model.\n- **Post-process the output:**  \n  Programmatically check if the returned values match what’s actually in your document.\n\n### Example Prompt\n\n```\nExtract the following fields as JSON from the provided invoice. If a field is not present, set its value to null. Do not guess or fill in missing information.\nFields: invoice_number, CIF, total, invoice_date, due_date, VAT.\n```\n\n### In Summary\n\n**When ChatGPT or the API generates \"common knowledge\" values, it’s because it is filling gaps based on typical invoice patterns, not extracting only what is present. This is a well-known limitation of current LLMs, especially when dealing with semi-structured document data.**\n\nIf you need reliable extraction, combine the LLM with robust parsing and explicit instructions, and always validate the output programmatically.\n\nLet me know if you want sample code or further guidance!",

          "response": "Below is an overview of why ChatGPT (or other GPT-based models) can sometimes introduce extra information or “common knowledge” when parsing a PDF invoice, along with tips to refine the output and limit unexpected content.\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n1. Why ChatGPT might introduce extra or incorrect content\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n\n1a. Hallucination (or “creative” completion)\n• GPT-based models are generative: if they sense missing or ambiguous information, they often attempt to “fill in” the gaps rather than leave fields blank.  \n• For instance, if an invoice total is unclear or not explicitly stated, the model might produce a plausible number (a hallucination) instead of stating that the information is not available.\n\n1b. Context from pre-training knowledge\n• GPT models are trained on a wide swath of internet text. When asked about a document (such as an invoice), they may rely on typical invoice conventions found during pre-training (e.g., typical invoice numbers, disclaimers, standard tax rates, etc.).  \n• Consequently, your JSON output could include “stock” or “generic” data about invoices not present in your PDF.\n\n1c. Ambiguous or incomplete instructions\n• If the prompt is not very explicit about the schema or how to handle missing data, the model may “helpfully” add fields with values. For instance, you may only request subtotal, tax, and total, but if the PDF text is unclear or does not explicitly have those fields named, ChatGPT might guess them.\n\n1d. Model trying to be “helpful”\n• GPT-based models are designed to produce helpful or comprehensive replies by default. If your prompt does not strictly enforce the JSON structure or does not instruct the model to “omit any unknown fields,” it may include disclaimers, extra text, or defaults.\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n2. How to get more accurate, JSON-only responses\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n\n2a. Use a strict system or role instruction\n• Provide a system message (if you’re using the API) or a carefully phrased user instruction on ChatGPT that clearly states the required JSON schema, and emphasize that no extra text should be provided.  \n• Example system prompt snippet:  \n  \"You are a data extraction tool. You receive PDF text and must respond ONLY with valid JSON using the following keys: invoice_number, CIF, total, dates, VAT. Do not include any additional fields or explanatory text.\"\n\n2b. Specify handling of missing or unclear fields\n• In your instructions, describe how to handle missing data. For example:  \n  \"If a requested field is not found in the PDF, set its value to null (or leave it empty) instead of guessing.\"\n\n2c. Double-check PDF text clarity\n• Sometimes the invoice text itself might lead to ambiguous extraction (e.g., scanning errors, partial text, unrecognized formatting). Ensure the text you feed into ChatGPT is as clear and structured as possible.  \n• If the PDF is unstructured or scanned, consider using an OCR or structured extraction tool first.\n\n2d. Provide examples and negative examples\n• Show ChatGPT exactly how you expect the final JSON to look with a sample invoice. Then provide a negative example illustrating what not to do (like adding disclaimers or extra fields).  \n• Example of a short demonstration in your prompt:  \n  \"Correct JSON example:  \n    {\n      'invoice_number': 'INV-1234',\n      'CIF': 'B12345678',\n      'total': '150.00',\n      'dates': '2023-10-15',\n      'VAT': '20.00'\n    }  \n   Do not output anything else.\"\n\n2e. Consider function calling (OpenAI plugin / advanced usage)\n• If you have access to the function calling feature in the OpenAI API, define a strict function schema that represents your invoice keys. When ChatGPT is instructed to call the function, it must match the schema. This typically eliminates extraneous text.\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n3. Troubleshooting tips\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n\n3a. Gradient approach in prompting\n• Start from simpler prompts, verifying the model can output exactly the fields you want with a mock invoice.  \n• Gradually increase complexity by introducing real invoice text and verifying the outputs.\n\n3b. Add post-processing or validation\n• Your application can parse the ChatGPT response as JSON and check for unexpected fields or keys. If extraneous fields are present, you can discard or ignore them.  \n• Alternatively, you can re-validate and ask ChatGPT to correct the format in a second prompt if it fails the validation.\n\n3c. Temperature settings\n• If you’re using the API, lower the temperature (e.g., 0.0 or 0.2) to reduce “creative” guesswork. This reduces the risk of the model inventing data and encourages more deterministic answers.\n\n3d. Chunking large documents\n• If the PDF is long, you might need to split it into smaller chunks for processing (especially if you’re hitting token limits). Summarize or parse each chunk, then merge results in your application layer.  \n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n4. Summary\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n\n• ChatGPT (and similar models) can add “common knowledge” or invented data to fill in perceived gaps. This behavior stems from the model’s training to be both helpful and creative.  \n• To reduce undesired additions, provide explicit instructions on the format, keys, and handling of missing data. You can further tighten the response by using strict prompts, function calling, or a low temperature.  \n• Finally, implement validation or post-processing to ensure the returned JSON contains exactly what your application needs.  \n\nBy carefully structuring your prompt, being explicit about what the model should and should not do, and adding a validation step on your side, you can significantly reduce extraneous or “common knowledge” data in the invoice extraction results.",

          "response": "When you ask ChatGPT (or the API) to extract invoice data from a PDF and output a JSON with specific keys, sometimes you might see output that “overwrites” or supplements your real data with what appears to be generic or “common knowledge” invoicing details. There are several reasons why this can happen:\n\n1. PDF-to-text extraction issues  \n • PDF files often contain complex formatting, graphics, or multi-column layouts. If the PDF isn’t preprocessed (or “OCRed”) correctly, the text that reaches ChatGPT might be incomplete, misordered, or lack proper context. In that case the model may not have enough specific detail to work from.  \n • When the extracted text looks “noisy” or ambiguous, ChatGPT might fall back on what it knows about typical invoice formats and generate data that resembles generic invoice details rather than what’s actually on your invoice.\n\n2. Implicit reliance on prior knowledge  \n • ChatGPT’s training data includes many examples of invoices and common invoice fields. If the prompt isn’t completely unambiguous or if the invoice content isn’t clearly delineated, the model might “guess” values by relying on what’s common in invoices (like standard labels or placeholder values for fields such as invoice number, VAT, CIF, etc.).  \n • This reliance on internalized patterns can lead to a JSON answer that inadvertently shows “default” or generalized values rather than strictly extracting from the specific invoice content you uploaded.\n\n3. Instructions and response formatting  \n • Even if you instruct the model to output only a JSON object with specific keys, if the context is not clear enough (or if the input text is partial or confusing), it might mix in extra content. In some cases the model might include side explanations or default examples based on what it “knows” about invoice structure.  \n • Be very explicit in your prompt (for example, “Analyze the following text EXACTLY as provided and respond with a JSON object that only includes the keys: invoice_number, CIF, total, date, VAT. Do not add any extra information or commentary.”). This helps reduce the chance of the model incorporating any generic, common knowledge details.\n\n4. Limitations in file handling  \n • Note that ChatGPT itself isn’t a native PDF parser. When you upload a PDF via the ChatGPT web interface or provide it through the API, behind the scenes there is a conversion process (or it might be processed as raw text) that might not capture the formatting or exact details of the invoice.  \n • In situations where the model “sees” only part of an invoice’s text, it might use its internal heuristics to fill in details that are statistically common—hence the “common knowledge” data you observe.\n\nTo improve accuracy and get just the JSON you expect, consider these recommendations:\n\n• Preprocess your PDF externally so that you reliably extract the text in a clean, structured format. Then pass that cleaned text to ChatGPT with clear instructions for extraction.\n  \n• Be very precise in your prompt. For example, include instructions like:  \n  \"Extract the following fields from the provided text: invoice_number, CIF, total, invoice_date, VAT_rate. Return ONLY a JSON object with these keys and nothing else. Do not include any extra commentary or generic data. Use only the information in the text below.\"\n  \n• Test with different invoices and adjust your prompt to handle differences in formatting so that ChatGPT isn’t forced to rely on patterns from its training data.\n\nIn summary, the appearance of “common knowledge” or generic invoice details typically occurs because of a combination of imperfect PDF text extraction, the model’s reliance on learned invoice patterns, and occasionally not having explicit enough instructions to isolate and return only the invoice-specific data. Making sure that the input text is clean and that your instructions are as clear and specific as possible can help reduce these issues.",

You're encountering an issue where the response contains common knowledge data rather than the specific invoice information you're looking for. Here are some details and potential solutions:\n\n1. PDF Parsing Limitations:\nChatGPT and the OpenAI API don't have direct PDF parsing capabilities. They work with text input, so the PDF content needs to be converted to text first.\n\n2. Prompt Engineering:\nThe way you phrase your request is crucial. Be very specific about what you want extracted and in what format.\n\n3. Context Window:\nThere's a limit to how much text can be processed in one go. Large invoices might exceed this limit.\n\n4. Training Data:\nChatGPT's knowledge cutoff date means it might not recognize very recent invoice formats or company-specific layouts.\n\nPotential Solutions:\n\n1. Pre-processing:\nConvert the PDF to text before sending it to the API. Use tools like PyPDF2 or pdfminer for this.\n\n2. Structured Prompts:\nUse a very structured prompt that clearly outlines the exact fields you want extracted and the format you want them in.\n\n3. Few-shot Learning:\nProvide examples of correct extractions in your prompt to guide the model.\n\n4. Post-processing:\nImplement additional logic on your end to validate and clean up the returned data.\n\n5. Fine-tuning:\nFor consistent, company-specific invoices, consider fine-tuning a model on your data.\n\nExample Prompt:\n\"Extract the following information from this invoice text and return it as a JSON object:\n{\n  'invoice_number': '',\n  'date': '',\n  'total_amount': '',\n  'vat': '',\n  'company_cif': ''\n}\nOnly include these fields and ensure all values are extracted directly from the invoice.

(your message was incomplete).\n\nFrom your context, common problems with this workflow are:\n\n1. **ChatGPT includes extra text**: Sometimes, even when you request \"only JSON,\" the model may add explanations, comments, or other content.\n2. **Missing or hallucinated fields**: ChatGPT might make up fields or skip ones that are present in the document.\n3. **Data accuracy**: Extracted data may be incorrect if the PDF's text is not clear or formatted unusually.\n4. **Session timeout / clearance expiry**: If you are using ChatGPT web, temporary links (from PDF uploads) may expire before extraction.\n\n**Best Practice Suggestions:**\n\n### 1. Ensure Only JSON Output\nAdd a system/content prompt like:\n```\nExtract only the following fields from this invoice as a valid JSON object:\n[\"invoice_number\", \"CIF\", \"total\", \"invoice_date\", \"VAT\"]\nRespond with only the JSON. Do not include any other text.\n```\nIf you still get extra text, try:\n```\nRespond with ONLY valid JSON. Do not include explanations, comments, or pre/post text.\n```\n\n### 2. Preprocess the PDF\nOpenAI's API does not natively process PDF files. If you upload a PDF to ChatGPT web, it tries to read the text, but may struggle with formatting. For best results:\n- Use tools like [pdfplumber](https://github.com/jsvine/pdfplumber) or [PyMuPDF](https://github.com/pymupdf/PyMuPDF) in Python to extract raw text from the PDF.\n- Send only the relevant text to ChatGPT for extraction.\n\n### 3. Specify JSON Structure and Handling of Missing Data\nBe explicit:\n```\nIf a field is missing, use null as its value. Example: {\"VAT\": null}\n```\n\n### 4. For API Use\nIf you're using the API, you can use the function calling feature (if available) or define a schema for extraction.\n\n### 5. Session/Link Expiry\nIf you're referring to \"clearance expiry,\" your session may be timing out before you get the data. Try downloading the text first, then prompt for extraction, rather than uploading the PDF each time.\n\n---\n\n**Example Workflow:**\n\n1. **Extract text from PDF** (locally, using Python or another tool).\n2. **Send text to OpenAI’s API** with a prompt like:\n   ```\n   Extract the following fields from the text below and return only valid JSON with these exact keys: [\"invoice_number\", \"CIF\", \"total\", \"invoice_date\", \"VAT\"]. If a value is missing, set it to null. Do not include any extra text.\n\n   [PASTE EXTRACTED TEXT HERE]\n   ```\n3. **Parse the JSON** in your code.\n\n---\n\nIf you clarify the specific issue (what happens \"before my clearance expires\" or what exact problem is occurring), I can offer more targeted troubleshooting!\n\n**Let me know the missing part or paste the error message so I can help directly.**",

          "response": "Below are some tips and best practices to help you reliably extract structured JSON data from invoices (or similar documents) via the OpenAI API or ChatGPT interface, while minimizing “hallucinations” or extraneous text. The overarching idea is to:\n\n• Convert the PDF into machine-readable text first (if needed).  \n• Provide only the slices of text that are relevant to your request.  \n• Give ChatGPT explicit, strict instructions on how to respond.  \n• Parse and valid­ate the JSON in your application.\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n1. Pre-process the PDF invoice and extract readable text\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nA PDF file may contain text that ChatGPT cannot directly parse when you simply upload it. If you are using the ChatGPT UI (web interface), uploading a PDF typically means ChatGPT is only operating on the filename, or has partial PDF-to-text extraction built in depending on your interface/tool. In many cases, the text extraction is incomplete or inaccurate, leading to garbled or “invented” data.\n\nInstead:\n1. Use a PDF text-extraction library or OCR tool before sending it to the model. For example:  \n   • PyPDF2 or pdfplumber (for OCR-less, text-based PDFs).  \n   • Tesseract OCR or docTR (for image-based PDFs).  \n2. Clean the extracted text (remove headers, footers, repeated patterns).  \n3. Keep only the sections necessary for your data extraction (the invoice lines, total, etc.).  \n4. Feed those relevant chunks of text to the model in your request.\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n2. Provide a structured prompt with explicit instructions\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nWhen calling the model via the ChatGPT API or the web UI, make sure your instructions are very explicit about the output format. For example:\n\n• Use a system or developer message (OpenAI API) that states:  \n  “You are a data extraction assistant. I will provide you with an invoice in the form of text. You must return only valid JSON with the following keys. No extra text or explanations.”\n\n• In your user message, provide the invoice text as context, and then say:  \n  “Extract the following fields as a JSON object:  \n     {  \n       \"invoice_number\": \"...\",  \n       \"cif\": \"...\",  \n       \"total\": \"...\",  \n       \"issue_date\": \"...\",  \n       \"due_date\": \"...\",  \n       \"vat\": \"...\",  \n       \"vat_rate\": \"…\"  \n     }  \n   Return only JSON, do not include markdown, backticks, or explanations.”\n\nExample structured prompt (API style):\n──────────────────────────────────────────\nsystem: \n\"You are a helpful assistant specialized in extracting data from text. \nOutput strictly in JSON with the fields: invoice_number, cif, total, issue_date, due_date, vat, and vat_rate.\"\n\nuser:\n\"Here is the text from the PDF invoice:\n---\n[PASTE TEXT OF THE INVOICE HERE]\n---\nPlease parse and return valid JSON.\"\n──────────────────────────────────────────\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n3. Consider using OpenAI’s “function calling” feature (API)\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nIf you are accessing the OpenAI API programmatically and you want to ensure the output is strictly JSON (and not extraneous text or explanations), the function-calling feature can help enforce the structure. You define a function signature (in JSON Schema) describing the fields you need, and when ChatGPT “calls” the function, you get a well-formatted JSON object back. For example:\n\n• Define a function with name “extract_invoice_data” and parameters:\n  {\n    \"type\": \"object\",\n    \"properties\": {\n      \"invoice_number\": {\"type\": \"string\"},\n      \"cif\": {\"type\": \"string\"},\n      \"total\": {\"type\": \"string\"},\n      \"issue_date\": {\"type\": \"string\"},\n      \"due_date\": {\"type\": \"string\"},\n      \"vat\": {\"type\": \"string\"},\n      \"vat_rate\": {\"type\": \"string\"}\n    },\n    \"required\": [\"invoice_number\", \"cif\", \"total\"]\n  }\n\n• Pass the invoice text as the user message, along with this function definition.  \n• The model will respond with a “function call” containing strictly the JSON data.\n\nWith function calling, you do not have to manually parse the raw text output—OpenAI’s API handles the structured data parse for you.\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n4. Validate JSON on the client side\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nEven if you have a well-structured request, mistakes can happen. Always validate the returned JSON to make sure it includes the keys you expect. If you do get extraneous text, parse out only the JSON part, or rely on the function-calling approach which guarantees JSON by design.\n\nA fallback approach is:\n1. Extract the JSON substring from the response with a regex.  \n2. Use a JSON library to parse it.  \n3. If parsing fails, treat it as an error and possibly re-request from ChatGPT or handle it manually.\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n5. Tips to reduce hallucinations and incorrect data\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n• Provide only the relevant text from the PDF. Large documents or repeated text can confuse the model.  \n• Use shorter prompts and more direct language: “Do not add extra fields.” “Return only these fields.”  \n• If the invoice format is fairly consistent, highlight or label the text (e.g., “Invoice Number: XYZ123”) so it’s easier for ChatGPT to parse.  \n• Add examples: Show ChatGPT a small example of an invoice text chunk and the resulting JSON. Then ask it to do the same with your real data.\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n6. Summary of the workflow\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n1. Convert PDF to text (via pdfplumber, PyPDF2, or OCR if needed).  \n2. Clean up the raw text so it’s easy to parse.  \n3. Use the OpenAI API (or the ChatGPT UI, if needed) with a carefully structured prompt.  \n4. (Optional) Use function calling in the API to enforce guaranteed JSON.  \n5. Validate the returned JSON in your application.\n\nFollowing these steps should improve the reliability of extracting your invoice data into the desired JSON structure and eliminate much of the “creative” or “hallucinated” text that can appear when the model doesn’t have clear instructions or sees complex, unstructured PDF data.",

          "response": "Below are some strategies you can use to help ensure that ChatGPT’s output is properly constrained to just the JSON with only your specified keys:\n\n1. Be very explicit in your instructions. For example, your prompt might say:  \n   “Extract data from the following PDF invoice and output ONLY a valid JSON object with the following keys: invoice_number, CIF, total, dates, VAT. Do not include any additional text, explanations, or context. Output only the JSON.”\n\n2. Provide an example. Including a “before/after” style sample helps the model know exactly what format you expect. For instance:  \n   - Input sample text from the invoice.  \n   - Follow it with: “Example expected output: { 'invoice_number': '12345', 'CIF': 'XYZ123', 'dates': '2023-09-15', 'total': '200.00', 'VAT': '21%' }”\n\n3. Use system and developer messages if possible. If you’re using the API, use a system prompt that sets the behavior for all responses. For example, “You are a JSON formatter. When given invoice text, you must return a JSON object only containing the keys that I define. Do not output any additional text or commentary.”\n\n4. Consider using stop sequences. When calling the API, you can specify stop tokens (like a newline or a crafted token) that instruct the model to stop output as soon as the JSON is complete. This can sometimes cut off unwanted appended comments.\n\n5. Post-process the output. If you still receive extra data along with your JSON, you can apply a simple parser on your side (using a regular expression or JSON parsing library) to extract and validate just the JSON part before further processing.\n\n6. Remember that ChatGPT isn’t inherently a PDF parser. If you’re uploading a real PDF invoice, make sure you’re first converting the PDF to text in a way that preserves the layout and key values. Once you have the text, you can then send it with the strict instructions.\n\nBy adding these layers of instruction and controls, you should be able to minimize extra data being returned and have responses that comply with your requirements before any session or “clearance” (token limit or context switch) issues appear. \n\nTry iterating on your prompt until you reliably get only the JSON output you expect.",

When using OpenAI's API or the ChatGPT web interface to extract data from PDF invoices, the response may not always be in the desired format or include the specific keys you need.\n\nHere are a few suggestions that may help you overcome this challenge:\n\n1. **Provide Clear Instructions**: When making your request, be as specific as possible about the information you need. Provide a sample JSON format with the exact keys you want, and clearly communicate that you need the output in this exact structure.\n\n2. **Refine Your Prompts**: Try experimenting with different prompts to see if you can get more accurate and structured responses. For example, you could try something like: \"Extract the following information from the PDF invoice as a JSON object: invoice number, CIF, total, dates, VAT. Please provide the output in the following format: `{ 'invoice_number': '123', 'cif': 'ABC123', 'total': 1000.00, 'dates': { 'issue_date': '2023-04-01', 'due_date': '2023-04-30' }, 'vat': 210.00 }`.\"\n\n3. **Use Pre-trained Models or Libraries**: Instead of relying solely on the OpenAI API or ChatGPT, you could explore using pre-trained models or libraries designed specifically for invoice data extraction, such as Tabula, Camelot, or PDFPlumber. These tools may provide more structured and reliable results.\n\n4. **Combine Multiple Approaches**: Consider using a combination of approaches, such as using the OpenAI API or ChatGPT to get a rough extraction, and then post-processing the data using your own code or a specialized library to ensure it matches the desired format.\n\n5. **Provide Feedback to OpenAI**: If you consistently encounter issues with the output format, you could consider providing feedback to OpenAI. This may help them improve the natural language understanding and data extraction capabilities of their models, ultimately benefiting you and other users.\n\nRemember, working with unstructured data like PDF invoices can be challenging, and it may take some experimentation to find the right approach that works for your specific use case.

          "response": "It looks like your question was cut off, but you've described an important issue: When using OpenAI's API (or ChatGPT web interface) to extract structured data (like JSON with invoice fields) from PDF invoices, the output sometimes contains data that:\n\n- Doesn’t match the real invoice (hallucinations or fabrications)\n- Includes extra/unrelated information\n- Misses required fields or formats them incorrectly\n\nLet's dive into the technical details behind these issues, and some best practices for more accurate extraction.\n\n## Technical Details & Challenges\n\n### 1. PDF Parsing Limitations\n- **PDF Structure:** PDFs are not inherently structured for text extraction; they are designed for rendering. Text may not be in a logical order, and important data (like tables or fields) may not be represented as such in the raw content.\n- **Conversion Step:** When uploading a PDF to ChatGPT, the document is converted to text first (either by OpenAI, or by your own process if using the API). This step can introduce errors:\n    - Fields may be split across lines or merged.\n    - Headers and values may be disassociated.\n    - Formatting (columns, tables) is lost.\n    - OCR errors if the invoice is scanned (image-based).\n\n### 2. Model Limitations\n- **Contextual Guessing:** GPT models are optimized for helpfulness. If a field is missing or unclear, they may \"hallucinate\" plausible values based on training data.\n- **Output Format:** The model can be inconsistent with strict formats like JSON, especially if the prompt is not very explicit and if the input is messy.\n- **Field Extraction:** Unless the model sees clear \"Invoice Number: X\" patterns, it may miss fields or make mistakes (e.g., swapping VAT and total).\n\n### 3. Prompting Issues\n- **Ambiguity:** Vague or underspecified prompts can lead the model to output extra commentary, explanations, or to invent values.\n- **Few-shot Examples:** Without showing the model examples of *exactly* what you want, it defaults to general helpfulness.\n\n## Best Practices for Accurate Extraction\n\n### 1. Preprocess the PDF Yourself\n- Use a robust PDF-to-text library (like [pdfplumber](https://github.com/jsvine/pdfplumber), [pdfminer.six](https://github.com/pdfminer/pdfminer.six), or [Tesseract OCR](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract) for scanned PDFs).\n- Clean and format the extracted text before sending it to the LLM.\n- Try to preserve logical groupings like “Invoice Number: 12345” instead of raw flows.\n\n### 2. Use Explicit, Constrained Prompts\n- Tell the model: “Extract strictly the following fields as a JSON object: [list your keys]. If a field is missing, use null. Do not include any text outside the JSON. Do not invent values.”\n- Provide a sample output format.\n- Ask for “verbatim transcription” of fields.\n\n**Example Prompt:**\n```plaintext\nYou are an automated invoice parser. Given the following invoice text, extract only the following fields in valid JSON: invoice_number, invoice_date, CIF, total, VAT, due_date, supplier_name. If any field is missing or unclear, set its value to null. Do not add any explanations or extra text.\n\nExample output:\n{\n  \"invoice_number\": \"A12345\",\n  \"invoice_date\": \"2024-06-18\",\n  \"CIF\": \"B12345678\",\n  \"total\": \"1234.56\",\n  \"VAT\": \"21%\",\n  \"due_date\": \"2024-07-18\",\n  \"supplier_name\": \"ACME Corp\"\n}\n\nHere is the invoice text:\n[PASTE EXTRACTED TEXT HERE]\n```\n\n### 3. Use OpenAI Function Calling (API only)\n- OpenAI's function-calling API allows you to define a schema for the fields you want.\n- The model will be *forced* to fill only those fields.\n- Example: [OpenAI Function Calling documentation](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/function-calling).\n\n### 4. Post-process and Validate\n- After extraction, use code to validate the JSON (field presence, data types, regex for dates, etc.).\n- Flag outputs for manual review if they don’t pass checks.\n\n### 5. Use Specialized Tools\n- Consider invoice-specific OCR/extraction tools ([Amazon Textract](https://aws.amazon.com/textract/), [Google Document AI](https://cloud.google.com/document-ai), [Rossum](https://rossum.ai/), etc.), which are trained for this use case.\n- Combine their output with LLMs for post-processing or filling in gaps.\n\n## Example Workflow\n\n1. **Extract text from PDF** using pdfplumber (for digital PDFs) or Tesseract (for images).\n2. **Preprocess** the text to remove headers/footers, extra whitespace, etc.\n3. **Prompt ChatGPT** (API) using a strict JSON schema or function calling.\n4. **Validate JSON output**; flag anomalies for review.\n\n## Why Model Hallucinates Values\n\n- If a field like “VAT” or “CIF” is missing, the model may invent a plausible value based on context or training data.\n- The model may “confabulate” totals or dates to be helpful, unless you tell it not to.\n\n## Summary Table\n\n| Challenge             | Solution                                       |\n|-----------------------|------------------------------------------------|\n| Messy PDF text        | Preprocess; use better PDF-to-text tools       |\n| Hallucinated data     | Explicit prompt: “If missing, use null”        |\n| Extra text in output  | “Output only JSON, no explanations”            |\n| Wrong field mapping   | Give examples; use strict field names          |\n| Model flexibility     | Use function calling for structured output     |\n\n---\n\nIf you need **sample code** for any step (PDF parsing, prompting, function calling), let me know! If you provide a sample invoice (with sensitive data redacted), I can tailor the workflow and prompt for you.",

          "response": "Below are some recommendations and technical considerations for reliably extracting data from PDF invoices into a JSON format using GPT-based models (ChatGPT or the OpenAI API). These suggestions address common issues such as “hallucinated” content, partial JSON, incorrect formatting, or extraneous text in the responses.\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n1. PRE-PROCESS THE PDF BEFORE ASKING GPT\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n• Convert PDF to Text: GPT models work best on text, so convert the PDF to text before sending it to GPT. For invoices that contain simple text (i.e., not heavily scanned images), you can use a PDF parsing library like PyPDF2 or pdfplumber in Python. If the invoices are scanned images, use an OCR library (e.g., Tesseract, ABBYY, or AWS Textract) to extract the text.\n• Clean/Normalize Extracted Text: Remove extra newlines, headers/footers, or other irrelevant elements so GPT receives only the core invoice data. The simpler and more structured the text, the better GPT can parse it.\n• Segment Large Invoices if Necessary: If invoices are long, consider chunking them so your model prompt remains below token limits.\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n2. PROVIDE A STRICT “SYSTEM” OR “INSTRUCTION” MESSAGE\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nWhen using the OpenAI API (for example, via the ChatCompletion endpoint), you can use the system role to define strict instructions about output format and permissible responses:\n\nExample system prompt (pseudo-JSON / instructions):\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n\"You are a data extraction assistant. You receive text from a PDF invoice. You must respond ONLY with valid JSON, containing the following keys:\n\n{\n  'invoice_number': 'string',\n  'CIF': 'string',\n  'total': 'string',\n  'date': 'string',\n  'VAT': 'string'\n}\n\nNo additional keys or commentary. No preamble. No explanation. Only JSON.\"\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n\nThis prompt clarifies the schema and instructs the model not to deviate. System prompts have higher priority than user prompts, so they can reduce extraneous output.\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n3. ENFORCE A JSON FORMAT THROUGH EXAMPLES\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nProviding a clear example can reduce “hallucinations” or format errors. Models often respond more accurately when you demonstrate the exact format you want.\n\nExample user prompt:\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n\"Below is the text from an invoice. Please parse it and extract the relevant fields.\n\nExample Input:\n-------------\nInvoice Text: \"Invoice #1234, CIF: A12345678, Total: 1500.00, VAT: 315.00, Date: 2023-10-05\"\n\nExample Output (JSON):\n{\n  \"invoice_number\": \"1234\",\n  \"CIF\": \"A12345678\",\n  \"total\": \"1500.00\",\n  \"date\": \"2023-10-05\",\n  \"VAT\": \"315.00\"\n}\n\nNow here is the actual invoice text:\n-------------\n[start of invoice text]\n[... content from the PDF here ...]\n[end of invoice text]\"\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n\nIncluding an example or template ensures the model sees precisely the style of JSON you want.\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n4. USE TEMPERATURE SETTINGS AND “TOKEN CONTROL”\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n• Temperature: Setting temperature lower (e.g., 0.0 or 0.2) makes the model more deterministic and less likely to produce creative or undesired formatting or text. \n• Max Tokens: Ensure you have enough tokens allocated to generate a complete JSON. If your output is being truncated, you might need to increase max_tokens or break the invoice text into smaller chunks.\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n5. VALIDATE THE RESPONSE PROGRAMMATICALLY\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nRegardless of how well you instruct GPT, there is always a chance of malformed JSON or additional commentary. Set up a validation step that:\n• Checks if the response is parseable JSON (e.g., use Python’s json.loads).\n• If the JSON is invalid, automatically retry with a more explicit or corrective prompt:\n   - \"Your response was invalid JSON. Remember, do not include additional text. Provide only valid JSON that follows the schema.\"\n\nBy adding a retry mechanism, you can automate the process of getting a correctly formatted JSON even if the initial response fails.\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n6. CONSTRAIN THE MODEL WITH TOOLS OR FUNCTIONS (FUNCTION CALLING)\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nOpenAI’s newer models (ChatGPT with Function Calling) allow you to define a function schema in your request. If you are using an API version that supports function calling, you can define the fields (keys and data types) that you expect. The model can respond in a structured format, which you can parse in code directly without manually forcing the JSON syntax. For example:\n\nExample function definition in Python (for the ChatCompletion API):\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nfunctions = [\n    {\n        \"name\": \"extract_invoice_data\",\n        \"description\": \"Extracts invoice data from provided text\",\n        \"parameters\": {\n            \"type\": \"object\",\n            \"properties\": {\n                \"invoice_number\": {\"type\": \"string\"},\n                \"CIF\": {\"type\": \"string\"},\n                \"total\": {\"type\": \"string\"},\n                \"date\": {\"type\": \"string\"},\n                \"VAT\": {\"type\": \"string\"}\n            },\n            \"required\": [\"invoice_number\", \"CIF\", \"total\", \"date\", \"VAT\"]\n        },\n    }\n]\n\nmessages = [\n    {\"role\": \"system\", \"content\": \"You are a data extraction assistant...\"},\n    {\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": invoice_text}\n]\n\nresponse = openai.ChatCompletion.create(\n    model=\"gpt-4-0613\",\n    messages=messages,\n    functions=functions,\n    function_call={\"name\": \"extract_invoice_data\"}\n)\n\n# The response will typically come back with the chosen function and arguments in structured form.\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nWith this approach, you won’t have to worry manually about JSON formatting, since the function call feature enforces a structured schema.\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n7. MANAGING “HALLUCINATED” OR INCORRECT CONTENT\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nEven with correct formatting, GPT may extract incorrect or “hallucinated” data. Common cases include: \n• GPT misreading text because the original PDF or OCR was unclear.\n• GPT filling in missing fields with guesses.\n\nTechniques to mitigate:\n• Strictly specify that if a field can’t be identified, GPT should output an empty string or “null” for that key instead of guessing a value.\n• Provide more context or a stable example. If the PDF layout is consistent across invoices, highlight the location of the data in the text (e.g., “The ‘invoice_number’ always appears on the second line after the word ‘Invoice #:’”).\n• Use a double-check logic:\n   1. Prompt GPT to parse the text into JSON with all relevant fields.\n   2. Prompt GPT again (or a different model) to validate or match each field’s raw text location.\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n8. HANDLE MULTIPLE CULTURAL/REGIONAL FORMATTING DIFFERENCES\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nInvoices may have localized differences (decimal separators, date formats, etc.). In your prompt or function specification, define:\n• Expected date format (YYYY-MM-DD, DD/MM/YYYY, etc.).\n• Decimal vs comma usage for numeric fields.\n• Whether to include currency symbols or not.\n\nIf GPT confuses the formatting, clarify in your instructions that the numeric values must adhere to your region’s or system’s format.\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nSUMMARY & BEST PRACTICES\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n1. Convert the PDF to text first (using PDF parsing or OCR).  \n2. Pass only the relevant, cleaned text to GPT with a strict system prompt.  \n3. Provide an explicit JSON schema or use function calling to ensure the output is structured.  \n4. Use “low temperature” and short instructions for less creative, more consistent responses.  \n5. Validate responses in your code. Retry (with more explicit instructions) if the JSON is invalid or incomplete.  \n6. Clarify any “unknown” or “missing” fields so GPT does not invent data.  \n\nBy employing these strategies, you should see more consistent, valid JSON outputs from ChatGPT or the OpenAI API when extracting invoice information. If you continue to get incorrect or malformed data, iterative refinement of your prompts and stronger validation logic on your application side will help you arrive at a robust solution.",

          "response": "Below are some technical details and strategies you can use when you need ChatGPT (or the API) to extract structured JSON data from a PDF invoice—and deal with issues such as extra or “contaminated” text in the output:\n\n──────────────────────────────\n1. PDF Preprocessing and Text Extraction\n\n• PDF Conversion First: Remember that ChatGPT can’t parse a PDF binary file directly. In your workflow you should first extract the text (or OCR if it’s an image PDF) using libraries such as PyPDF2, pdfminer.six, or Tesseract (for scanned PDFs).  \n  Example in Python (using pdfminer.six):  \n   from pdfminer.high_level import extract_text  \n   text = extract_text('invoice.pdf')  \n\n• Clean the Text: Sometimes PDFs contain artifacts (headers/footers, watermarks, layout issues). Preprocess and clean up the extracted text so that the invoice data (invoice number, CIF, totals, dates, VAT etc.) is clearly delimited for your prompt.\n\n──────────────────────────────\n2. Prompt Engineering for Strict JSON Output\n\n• Precise and explicit instructions: When you send the PDF’s text to ChatGPT, include an instruction akin to:  \n  \"Given the below invoice text, extract only the following fields: invoiceNumber, CIF, total, dates, VAT, etc. Return the result as a valid JSON object with those keys, and do not include any additional commentary, markdown formatting, or extra keys.\"  \n\n• Example Prompt:  \n\n  -----------\n  Invoice Text:\n  ----------  \n  {paste cleaned text from PDF here}  \n  -----------  \n\n  Please extract the following keys: { \"invoiceNumber\", \"CIF\", \"total\", \"date\", \"VAT\" }  \n  Respond with only a valid JSON object, with no markdown formatting or explanation.\n  -----------\n\n• Reinforce the “only output JSON” instruction. If you’ve seen extra text appear, you might add:  \n  \"Your entire response should be completely parsable JSON. Do not output any text before or after the JSON.\"\n\n──────────────────────────────\n3. Handling Extraneous Data in the Response\n\n• Model Behavior: ChatGPT sometimes “over-answers” by adding explanations or repeating some context even when instructed otherwise. To mitigate, you can:\n  – Use strong formatting directions (“just the JSON”).  \n  – Add a follow-up instruction like: “Please reformat your answer as pure JSON with no extra text, not even code block markers.”\n\n• Post-Processing: Even if the response contains extra characters (e.g., “```json” markers or trailing explanations), you can apply a post-processing step (using a JSON parser in your code) to extract the valid JSON part. For instance:\n  – Use a regex to capture text between the first “{” and last “}”.  \n  – Validate with a JSON parser (e.g., Python’s json.loads) and, if there’s an error, prompt the API to “fix” the formatting.\n\n──────────────────────────────\n4. Using API Parameters and System Prompts\n\n• System Messages: When using the API, consider including a system message specifying the strict output format.  \n  Example: “You are a JSON extraction engine. Given invoice text, you will output a JSON object with the required keys and nothing else.”  \n\n• Temperature and Max Tokens: Lower temperature (e.g., 0.0–0.2) can reduce creative deviation that might add narrative text. Also ensure your token limit is high enough to cover the invoice text and the expected JSON.\n\n──────────────────────────────\n5. Sample Code Workflow\n\nBelow is a pseudo-code outline:\n\n  a. Extract and preprocess text from PDF.\n  b. Craft your prompt:\n   prompt = \"Extract only these fields ... [instruction as above] + 'Invoice text: [your preprocessed text]'\"  \n  c. Call the OpenAI API with a system message and the prompt.\n  d. Receive the result.\n  e. Post-process the output:\n   i. Strip any markdown formatting, code fences, etc.\n   ii. Validate/parse as JSON.\n   iii. If parsing fails, either fix it programmatically (if possible) or issue a follow-up request specifying: \"Your previous answer was not strictly JSON. Please reply with only valid JSON.\"\n\n──────────────────────────────\n6. Caveats and Considerations\n\n• Input Complexity: Real-world invoices can have various layouts and content variations. Even with detailed prompts, ChatGPT may sometimes miss or misinterpret elements. Consider building multiple examples in your prompt (few-shot) to “teach” it the expected output structure.\n\n• Consistent Key Naming: Specify in your prompt exactly what each key should be named. If you require keys such as \"invoiceNumber\" (and not variations like \"Invoice ID\"), spell out each desired key.\n\n• Data Precision: ChatGPT is not a specialized parser. For production usage, consider combining its output with rule-based validation or using dedicated invoice processing and OCR solutions that guarantee high accuracy.\n\n──────────────────────────────\nConclusion\n\nBy preprocessing your PDF, crafting a precise prompt (with clear instructions for JSON-only output), using system-level messages, and possibly applying post-processing for cleanup and validation, you can mitigate the issue of getting extra text in the response. This approach allows you to leverage the strengths of ChatGPT while handling its occasional over-generative behavior.\n\nIf you continue to encounter behavior issues, experiment with temperature or try altering the prompt instructions slightly (e.g., “Don't include any additional commentary”) until you get a consistently valid JSON output.\n\nFeel free to ask if you need further clarification or help with a specific implementation detail.",

Use a PDF-to-Text Preprocessor\nOpenAI's models work best with plain text, not raw PDFs. Convert the PDF to text (or extract relevant sections) before sending it to the API.\n\n**Tools:**  \n- [pdfplumber](https://github.com/jsvine/pdfplumber) (Python)\n- [PyMuPDF (fitz)](https://pymupdf.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)\n- [Adobe Acrobat] for manual copying (for small jobs)\n\n**Example (Python):**\n```python\nimport pdfplumber\n\nwith pdfplumber.open(\"invoice.pdf\") as pdf:\n    text = \"\"\n    for page in pdf.pages:\n        text += page.extract_text()\n```\n\n---\n\n### 2. Define a Strict Prompt\n\nBe very explicit in your prompt to the model:\n\n- Request **only** valid JSON, no explanations.\n- Specify the required keys and their types.\n- Tell the model to output `{}` if a key is missing or not found.\n\n**Example Prompt:**\n```\nExtract the following fields from the provided text and return only a valid JSON object with these keys: \"invoice_number\", \"CIF\", \"total\", \"issue_date\", \"due_date\", \"VAT\". If a field is missing, use null as its value. Do not include any extra text.\n\nText:\n\"\"\"\n<Insert the extracted plain text from the invoice here>\n\"\"\"\n```\n\n---\n\n### 3. Use the API’s Function Calling Feature (if available)\n\nIf you're using the OpenAI API (GPT-4 or GPT-3.5-turbo), you can define a function schema so the output is always structured. This reduces hallucination and formatting errors.\n\n**Example:**\n\n```python\nfunctions = [\n  {\n    \"name\": \"extract_invoice_data\",\n    \"parameters\": {\n      \"type\": \"object\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"invoice_number\": {\"type\": \"string\"},\n        \"CIF\": {\"type\": \"string\"},\n        \"total\": {\"type\": \"string\"},\n        \"issue_date\": {\"type\": \"string\"},\n        \"due_date\": {\"type\": \"string\"},\n        \"VAT\": {\"type\": \"string\"},\n      },\n      \"required\": [\"invoice_number\", \"CIF\", \"total\", \"issue_date\", \"VAT\"],\n    },\n  }\n]\n```\nThen call the model with this function and your prompt.\n\n---\n\n### 4. Post-Process the Output\n\nAlways validate the JSON output in your code. If the output is not valid JSON, attempt to fix it (e.g., with regex or a JSON repair library).\n\n---\n\n### 5. Consider Hybrid Approaches\n\nFor critical data (like invoice numbers), combine AI extraction with traditional regex or rule-based extraction as a fallback.\n\n---\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\n- **AI adds explanations or extra text:** Reiterate in your prompt: \"Return only valid JSON. Do not add any explanation or extra text.\"\n- **Incomplete JSON:** Reduce input size. Extract only the relevant portion of the invoice (such as the header or specific table).\n- **Wrong data:** Try different prompt phrasings, or provide examples in the prompt.\n\n---\n\n## Example End-to-End Flow\n\n1. Extract text from PDF.\n2. Send to OpenAI API with a strict prompt or function schema.\n3. Parse and validate the JSON response.\n4. Handle missing or malformed fields gracefully.\n\n---\n\nLet me know if you want example code for a specific step or if you want to share a sample invoice text for a custom prompt!",

          "response": "Below are some practical tips to help ensure ChatGPT (via the API or ChatGPT web interface) returns a strict JSON response when extracting data from PDF invoices:\n\n──────────────────────────────────────────────────\n1) Prepare the PDF text properly before sending it to ChatGPT\n──────────────────────────────────────────────────\n• PDF files often contain layout elements that can confuse text extraction. If you’re directly pasting PDF text into ChatGPT, make sure you use a reliable OCR (Optical Character Recognition) or PDF-to-text tool to convert it to clean text.  \n• Remove non‐essential text elements like footers, page numbers, or unrelated metadata that can confuse the model.\n\n──────────────────────────────────────────────────\n2) Use role messages to enforce JSON-only output\n──────────────────────────────────────────────────\nIf you’re using the ChatGPT API (or the “Advanced Data Analysis” / “Code Interpreter” environment, if available), you can strongly guide the model’s output by specifying:\n\n• SYSTEM MESSAGE (high-level instruction):\n  ──────────────────────────────────────────\n  For example:\n  {\n    \"role\": \"system\",\n    \"content\": \"You are a JSON data extractor. You read plain text from invoices and return only valid JSON with the specified keys. Do not include any additional commentary or explanations.\"\n  }\n\n• USER MESSAGE (the actual request):\n  ──────────────────────────────────\n  For example:\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"Extract the following fields from the invoice text: ['invoice_number', 'CIF', 'total', 'date', 'VAT']. Return them as a valid JSON object with those keys. The invoice text is: <INVOICE_TEXT_HERE>.\"\n  }\n\nBy combining these two messages, you emphasize:\n1) The role: “You are a JSON data extractor.”  \n2) The format requirement: “Return only valid JSON. No extra text.”  \n\n──────────────────────────────────────────────────\n3) Use function calling if available (OpenAI API feature)\n──────────────────────────────────────────────────\nOpenAI’s function calling feature (supported by GPT-3.5-turbo and GPT-4 as of mid-2023) helps ensure the response is valid JSON. You define a function signature for the data you want (e.g., invoice_number, CIF, total, date, VAT), and the model will return a JSON object that fits your schema.\n\nExample function specification (in pseudocode):\n─────────────────────────────────────────────\nfunctions = [\n  {\n    \"name\": \"extract_invoice_data\",\n    \"description\": \"Extract relevant invoice fields\",\n    \"parameters\": {\n      \"type\": \"object\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"invoice_number\": { \"type\": \"string\" },\n        \"CIF\": { \"type\": \"string\" },\n        \"total\": { \"type\": \"number\" },\n        \"date\": { \"type\": \"string\" },\n        \"VAT\": { \"type\": \"string\" }\n      },\n      \"required\": [\"invoice_number\", \"CIF\", \"total\", \"date\", \"VAT\"]\n    }\n  }\n]\n\nWhen you call the model with this function specification, instruct it to parse the PDF invoice text and to call extract_invoice_data. The API will return a structured JSON event in response.\n\n──────────────────────────────────────────────────\n4) Use a strict prompt or post-process the output\n──────────────────────────────────────────────────\nEven with careful prompting, ChatGPT may insert extra text. Here are countermeasures:\n\n• Strict prompt enforcement:\n  “Return only valid JSON. Do not include any explanatory text or preambles (like ‘Here is the information: …’). Simply output the JSON.”\n• Post‐processing:\n  If ChatGPT still includes disclaimers or extra text, parse the response in your code. A robust approach:\n  1) Use a regular expression or JSON parser to extract the JSON portion.  \n  2) Validate it.  \n  3) If it fails, you can re‐prompt ChatGPT with a message to correct the JSON.\n\nA possible final user prompt example:\n─────────────────────────────────\n\"You are a JSON data extractor. I will provide invoice text. Extract 'invoice_number', 'CIF', 'total', 'date', and 'VAT' as valid JSON. Do not include any additional keys, or any commentary. Only output valid JSON, nothing else.\n\nInvoice text:  \n[YOUR_INVOICE_TEXT]\"\n\n──────────────────────────────────────────────────\n5) Keep the request clear and minimal\n──────────────────────────────────────────────────\n• Large or ambiguous prompts can cause the model to attempt “helpful” commentary.  \n• Keep the instructions succinct and the text to be extracted minimal but sufficient.  \n\n──────────────────────────────────────────────────\n6) Verify the output programmatically\n──────────────────────────────────────────────────\n• Always parse the returned JSON in your application code.  \n• If the output fails to parse, you can ask ChatGPT to “reformat only” or correct the JSON output.\n\n──────────────────────────────────────────────────\nSummary\n──────────────────────────────────────────────────\n1. Extract the raw text from the invoice in a clean manner (minimal noise).  \n2. Use a system instruction that firmly requests JSON only.  \n3. Use function calling if possible to strongly enforce JSON output.  \n4. If the response contains extra text, either enforce a stricter system message or parse out the JSON in your application code.  \n\nWith these steps, you should see a much higher success rate in getting a clean JSON structure from ChatGPT for your invoice data extraction.",

          "response": "Below are some strategies to help ensure your extraction output is strictly JSON with only the keys you expect:\n\n1. Be explicit in your prompt. For example:\n  \"Extract the following fields from the PDF invoice: invoice_number, CIF, total, dates, VAT. Please output only a JSON object that includes exactly these keys and no additional text, commentary, markdown, or formatting. The output should be valid JSON, nothing else.\"\n\n2. Use a system or developer instruction to set context. If you’re using the API, you can include a system message like:\n  \"You are an extraction engine that only outputs valid JSON in response to invoice data extraction requests. Do not provide any additional commentary or text beyond the JSON.\"\n\n3. Validate and post-process the response. Even with clear instructions, occasional extra text might appear. If so, you can:\n  • Use a regular expression (or a JSON parser with error recovery) to extract the JSON block (for example, identifying the first “{” and the final “}”).\n  • If you’re coding in Python, you can try something like:\n    import re, json\n    match = re.search(r\"({.*})\", response_text, re.DOTALL)\n    if match:\n     output_json = json.loads(match.group(1))\n\n4. Test with synthetic input first. Before applying it to real invoices, use a mock PDF invoice (or its extracted text) that only contains the expected fields. This helps confirm that the prompt is producing strict JSON output. Once you confirm it works, switch to your real PDF data.\n\n5. Consider using a chain-of-thought approach. You can instruct the model to “think step-by-step” but also remind it at the end to output only the valid JSON result. For example:\n  \"Step through the extraction logic to determine the values, then output only the JSON with the keys invoice_number, CIF, total, dates, VAT. Do not provide any explanation, only the final JSON output.\"\n\n6. If you continue to see extraneous data, try rephrasing your request with additional constraints. For instance:\n  \"Only output the JSON data without any introductory or concluding text—output nothing but the JSON.\"\n\nBy using these strategies, you can usually constrain the output to just the JSON you need. If you’re still occasionally receiving extra data, using post-processing on the API’s response (such as a regex or a simple JSON validator) can be a reliable safety net.",

          "response": "It sounds like you’re encountering behavior where ChatGPT (or the API) does not strictly follow your instruction to output only JSON data in the format you specified. This is a common challenge when using large language models (LLMs), because they are designed to be generative and may insert additional text if the prompt isn’t structured or constrained tightly enough.\n\nBelow are some strategies you can try to improve the consistency of JSON-only responses and reduce the chance that ChatGPT includes unwanted text beyond those specific JSON keys (invoice number, CIF, total, dates, VAT, etc.):\n\n1) Provide a Strict “System” or “Role” Instruction (if using ChatGPT’s Chat API):\n   • In ChatGPT’s Chat API, you can place a high-level instruction in the system message (the first message) that says something akin to:\n     “You are a data extraction service. You will extract data from invoices in JSON format only. Do not provide any explanation or extra text; only return JSON that strictly follows the schema provided.”\n   • Because system messages typically have higher priority than user messages, they can help ensure that the model follows strict formatting rules.\n\n2) Use a Clear, Structured Prompt:\n   • When using text-davinci-003 or GPT-3.5/4 in completion-style calls, ensure your prompt explicitly states the format required and warns against including extraneous text. For example:\n\n     \"\"\"\n     You are given an invoice in text form. Extract the following fields: \n       - invoice_number\n       - cif\n       - total\n       - issue_date\n       - vat\n     Output ONLY a valid JSON object with these keys. Do not include any additional text, commentary, or explanations.\n\n     Invoice text:\n     [Paste the relevant text from the PDF here]\n     \"\"\"\n\n   • The key is to be explicit: “Output only JSON,” “No other text is allowed,” “Do not include extra keys,” etc.\n\n3) Verify You’re Extracting Text from the PDF First:\n   • The OpenAI API does not inherently “read” or “interpret” PDF documents directly. You need to extract the text from the PDF (using a separate tool like PyPDF2, pdfplumber, or other PDF parsing libraries) and then pass that text into the model.\n   • If you’re giving ChatGPT the textual contents from the PDF but also including meta information (e.g., headers, footers), it’s possible ChatGPT is picking up on those and including them in the output. Stripping out unnecessary text before feeding it to the model can help.\n\n4) Use Output Parsing Techniques:\n   • After getting ChatGPT’s text response, you can implement a post-processing check on your side—essentially ignoring any extra text before or after the JSON. For example:\n     – Use a regular expression to find the JSON substring in the response (e.g., a bracketed block starting with '{' and ending with '}').\n     – Parse the substring with a JSON parser to verify it’s valid JSON and in the correct format.\n     – If it’s invalid or missing keys, you can loop back and prompt ChatGPT again (redacting or clarifying the prompt more strictly).\n\n5) Consider Using “Function Calls” in ChatGPT (If Supported in Your Interface):\n   • If you have access to the ChatGPT plugin or the newer Chat Completion API with “function calling,” you can define a function signature that includes exactly the parameters (invoice_number, cif, total, dates, VAT, etc.). ChatGPT can directly return data in a structured JSON object that is easily parseable.\n   • This approach often forces the LLM to respond only with properly formed JSON according to a schema you define.\n\n6) Use a Temperature Setting that’s Lower:\n   • By reducing the “temperature” parameter, you decrease creativity and increase the likelihood of more consistent formatting. A temperature of 0 or near-0 often yields more literal, predictable responses—which helps if you’re strictly requiring JSON output.\n\n7) Provide an Example (Few-Shot Learning):\n   • Show ChatGPT exactly what the output should look like, down to the last bracket. For example:\n\n     \"\"\"\n     Desired JSON format (an example):\n     {\n       \"invoice_number\": \"12345\",\n       \"cif\": \"B12345678\",\n       \"total\": 1000.50,\n       \"issue_date\": \"2023-09-01\",\n       \"vat\": 21\n     }\n     \"\"\"\n\n   • Then say: “Produce the output in that exact same style, with no additional text.”\n\n8) Double-Check Policy Compliance and Data Retention:\n   • For an internal audit perspective, ensure that any content you send to ChatGPT or the API does not violate privacy or data protection policies. If the invoice PDFs contain sensitive or personal data (names, addresses, etc.), you may need to redact or tokenize those fields before sending them to the model.\n   • Consider whether your organization’s data handling policies, or relevant data protection regulations (e.g., GDPR), allow you to transmit potentially identifying information to a third-party service, even if it’s only for extraction. If needed, you could run the PDF text extraction yourself on-premises or in a secure environment, filter/redact any sensitive pieces, and only send the minimal necessary data to ChatGPT.\n\n9) Validate the JSON in Your Code:\n   • Even if ChatGPT occasionally emits extra text, your application can parse the string for valid JSON using a JSON parser. If the parser fails, you can either:\n     – Retry the request with a stricter prompt,\n     – Or programmatically remove extraneous text outside the curly braces before parsing.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nSummary of Key Points\n\n• Large language models often need extra “guardrails” to produce strictly structured output, especially JSON.  \n• Provide explicit instructions, minimal temperature, system or role prompts, and a clear JSON schema.  \n• Optionally implement a post-processing step to parse or validate the JSON and discard any extra text.  \n• Adhere to data security best practices by filtering out or redacting sensitive information before sending to the model.\n\nUsing these strategies should increase reliability for extracting JSON data and reduce any unexpected text in ChatGPT’s responses. If you still see extraneous text regularly, iterating on the prompt—in combination with function calling (if available)—tends to be the most robust solution.",

          "response": "It sounds like you’re running into issues where the output JSON isn’t “clean” and includes extra information beyond the desired keys. There are several reasons and approaches to consider:\n\n1. Clarify the Prompt Instructions\n • Make sure your prompt explicitly states that ONLY a JSON object with the specified keys is acceptable. For example, you might say, “Extract from the following invoice data the keys: invoice_number, CIF, total, date, VAT. Provide only the JSON output with these keys and no additional commentary or markdown formatting.”\n • If you’re sending the PDF’s raw text or converted content, ensure that the prompt clearly instructs the model to ignore any extra content.\n\n2. Use a Strict “Output Format” Guide\n • You can include a small example (a “golden example”) of exactly how the output should look. For instance:\n  {\n   \"invoice_number\": \"12345\",\n   \"CIF\": \"A12345678\",\n   \"total\": 100.50,\n   \"date\": \"2023-10-01\",\n   \"VAT\": 21\n  }\n • This reduces ambiguity for the model.\n\n3. Employ “Validation” and “Post-Processing”\n • Since LLMs sometimes add extra content, you might process the output with a JSON parser to filter out unexpected text. For instance, if you’re implementing this via your API, consider parsing with a JSON library (e.g., in Python, use json.loads) and if it fails, send a follow-up instruction or re-prompt.\n • If you have any extra “noise” (like a short explanation appended), you might use regex or a post-processing script to extract the JSON substring.\n\n4. Consider the PDF Conversion Step\n • Sometimes the way the PDF is converted into text might introduce formatting or extra content. Make sure that conversion is as clean as possible. Tools like OCR or PDF-to-text converters may be configured to produce consistent outputs.\n\n5. Use “System” and “User” Instructions (for API use)\n • When using the API, you can set up instructions in the system message to force a constrained output. For example:\n  System message: “You are a JSON data extraction tool. Your only output should be a JSON object with the keys invoice_number, CIF, total, date, and VAT. Do not produce any additional text.”\n • Then, in the user message, provide the text from the PDF invoice.\n\n6. Understand the Model’s Limitations\n • The completions sometimes include explanations or slightly rephrase; if the invoice content is ambiguous, the model may try to “explain” its reasoning. Reinforcing with “no explanation, only JSON” usually helps.\n • You might need to iterate a few times with small prompt modifications if the model’s output drifts from your strict requirements.\n\nBy refining your prompt, using examples, and potentially validating or cleaning up the JSON output externally, you can improve the consistency of your extracted JSON from invoices. If you still face issues, consider running experiments with a few sample invoices and tweak the instructions until the model consistently returns a clean JSON structure with only the desired keys.\n\nDoes this help address the problem you’re seeing?

          "response": "Absolutely, I understand the urgency! Let’s address your problem quickly and clearly:\n\n**Problem Recap:**  \nYou're using OpenAI's API (and ChatGPT web) to extract structured data (like invoice number, CIF, total, dates, VAT, etc.) from real PDF invoices. However, when you upload a PDF and request a strict JSON response, ChatGPT’s output is inconsistent—it may include extra text, explanations, or miss fields.\n\n---\n\n# How to Get Strict JSON Output from Invoices with OpenAI/ChatGPT\n\n### 1. **PDF to Text Extraction**\nFirst, ChatGPT cannot \"see\" PDFs directly—you must extract the text content of the PDF before sending it to the API. Use tools like [pdfplumber](https://github.com/jsvine/pdfplumber), [PyPDF2](https://pypi.org/project/PyPDF2/), or [Adobe Acrobat] to convert your PDF to raw text.\n\n**Example in Python:**\n```python\nimport pdfplumber\n\nwith pdfplumber.open(\"invoice.pdf\") as pdf:\n    text = \"\"\n    for page in pdf.pages:\n        text += page.extract_text()\n```\n\n---\n\n### 2. **Create a Precise Prompt**\nWhen you send the text to ChatGPT, use a very explicit prompt. For strict JSON, ask it to output ONLY the JSON, and to not explain or add anything extra.\n\n**Prompt Example:**\n```\nExtract the following fields from this invoice text: \n- invoice_number\n- CIF\n- total\n- date\n- VAT\n\nReturn ONLY a valid JSON object. Do NOT include explanations or any extra text.\n\nHere is the invoice text:\n\"\"\"\n<PASTE THE EXTRACTED TEXT HERE>\n\"\"\"\n```\n\n---\n\n### 3. **Use the API with \"response_format\" (if available)**\nIf you’re using the OpenAI API with GPT-4 or GPT-3.5-turbo, you can use the experimental response_format parameter to request a JSON response:\n\n**API Example:**\n```python\nimport openai\n\nresponse = openai.ChatCompletion.create(\n  model=\"gpt-4-turbo\",\n  messages=[\n    {\"role\": \"system\", \"content\": \"You are a helpful assistant.\"},\n    {\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"Extract the following fields ... [your prompt as above]\"}\n  ],\n  response_format={\"type\": \"json_object\"}\n)\n```\n\n**Note:** This helps enforce JSON output, reducing the risk of extra text.\n\n---\n\n### 4. **Post-process to Validate JSON**\nAlways validate that the response is valid JSON before using it in your workflow:\n\n```python\nimport json\n\ntry:\n    data = json.loads(response.choices[0].message['content'])\n    # Proceed with your logic\nexcept json.JSONDecodeError:\n    # Handle the error or retry\n```\n\n---\n\n### 5. **If Using ChatGPT Web**\n- Paste only the invoice text (not the PDF file).\n- Use the strict prompt above.\n- If it adds extra text, copy just the JSON block.\n\n---\n\n## **Summary Checklist for Your Boss**\n- **Extract PDF text first.**\n- **Use an explicit prompt requesting ONLY JSON.**\n- **(API) Use `response_format={\"type\": \"json_object\"}` if possible.**\n- **Validate the JSON output programmatically.**\n\n---\n\nIf you need an **example script** or **prompt template** for your specific invoice, paste a sample (with sensitive info redacted) and I’ll tailor a prompt for you!\n\n**Let me know if you need the exact Python code or have other requirements.**",

          "response": "Below is a concise set of steps and tips to help you reliably extract structured data (in JSON format) from PDF invoices using OpenAI’s API (or ChatGPT web), so you can provide the JSON to your boss on time.\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n1) PREPARE YOUR PDF CONTENT\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n• You will need the text of the PDF in a form ChatGPT can process. If the PDF is straightforward text (not heavily scanned or image-based), you can:\n  – Directly copy the text out of the PDF file.  \n  – Alternatively, convert the PDF to text using a library like PyPDF2 or pdfplumber in Python.\n\n• If you have a scanned PDF (i.e., images), you need OCR (Optical Character Recognition) before feeding the text to ChatGPT. Free options include Tesseract OCR or paid OCR APIs.\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n2) USE A ROBUST PROMPT THAT FORCES JSON\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n• Make your instruction extremely explicit. For example:\n\n  SYSTEM (or \"role: system\" in the API):\n  \"You are a helpful assistant that extracts data from invoices. Please follow the user’s instructions exactly, and provide only the JSON output.\"\n\n  USER (or \"role: user\" in the API):\n  \"Extract the following fields from the invoice text:  \n   - invoice_number  \n   - CIF  \n   - total  \n   - invoice_date  \n   - VAT  \n   \n   Return them in valid JSON using the following schema:\n\n   {\n     'invoice_number': '', \n     'CIF': '', \n     'total': '', \n     'invoice_date': '', \n     'VAT': ''\n   }\n\n   IMPORTANT:  \n   1) Output only JSON (no extra text).  \n   2) Do not include any additional fields.  \n   3) Do not wrap in markdown.  \n   4) Ensure the JSON is valid and properly quoted.\n\n   Here is the invoice text (between triple backticks):\n   ```\n   [PASTE INVOICE TEXT HERE]\n   ```\n   \"\n\n• This explicit approach often prevents ChatGPT from inserting disclaimers or additional commentary. You’re telling it exactly what format you want—JSON—and what keys to include. \n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n3) TIPS FOR MORE RELIABLE RESPONSES\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n• Use temperature=0 or a low temperature. In OpenAI’s API calls, setting temperature to 0 reduces creative “hallucination” and focuses on factual extraction.\n\n• Use max_tokens wisely. Make sure you have enough tokens in your response limit to handle the entire text of your invoice plus structured JSON in the response.\n\n• Provide your sample JSON structure explicitly in the prompt. If possible, you can also give an example with dummy data:\n\n  Example:\n  {\n    \"invoice_number\": \"INV-001\",\n    \"CIF\": \"B12345678\",\n    \"total\": \"123.45\",\n    \"invoice_date\": \"2023-09-01\",\n    \"VAT\": \"21%\"\n  }\n\n  \"Now follow this exact format for your output.\"\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n4) IF YOU STILL GET EXTRA TEXT...\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n• Wrap your entire user instruction in a “system” or “developer” role (when using the API) to strongly enforce rules. For example:\n\n  SYSTEM:\n  \"You are a data extraction agent. Return valid JSON only. If you add text beyond JSON, you have failed.\"\n\n  USER:\n  \"Instruction to extract JSON...\"\n\n• If you’re using ChatGPT website, sometimes ChatGPT appends disclaimers or explanations. Try a short follow-up message: “Please only return the JSON. Do not include anything else.” Usually that corrects the issue.\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n5) EXAMPLE PYTHON CODE (USING OPENAI API)\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nBelow is a brief illustration of how you might send the message:\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nimport openai\n\nopenai.api_key = \"YOUR_API_KEY\"\n\ninvoice_text = \"\"\"\n[Paste the text extracted from your PDF here]\n\"\"\"\n\nmessages = [\n    {\n        \"role\": \"system\",\n        \"content\": \"You are a data extraction agent. Return valid JSON only.\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"role\": \"user\",\n        \"content\": f\"\"\"\n        Extract the following fields from the invoice text:\n         - invoice_number\n         - CIF\n         - total\n         - invoice_date\n         - VAT\n\n        Return them in valid JSON using the following schema:\n        {{\n          \"invoice_number\": \"\",\n          \"CIF\": \"\",\n          \"total\": \"\",\n          \"invoice_date\": \"\",\n          \"VAT\": \"\"\n        }}\n\n        IMPORTANT:\n         1) Output only JSON (no extra text).\n         2) Do not include any additional keys.\n         3) Do not wrap in markdown.\n         4) Ensure it is valid JSON.\n\n        Here is the invoice text:\n        {invoice_text}\n        \"\"\"\n    }\n]\n\nresponse = openai.ChatCompletion.create(\n    model=\"gpt-3.5-turbo\",         # or \"gpt-4\"\n    messages=messages,\n    temperature=0,\n    max_tokens=500\n)\n\njson_output = response['choices'][0]['message']['content']\nprint(json_output)\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n• This code snippet shows how to structure your query. You can then parse the JSON in Python with json.loads(json_output).\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nIN SUMMARY\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n1. Convert the PDF invoice to text (via copy/paste or OCR).  \n2. Provide an extremely explicit prompt with an example JSON schema.  \n3. Enforce JSON-only output by re-iterating “Return only JSON” in your prompt and system messages.  \n4. Use low temperature settings and the relevant role instructions to reduce unwanted text.  \n5. Parse the returned JSON in your application.\n\nFollow these steps, and you should have clean, valid JSON from your invoice text—hopefully well before the 30-minute deadline. Good luck!",

For example, give ChatGPT a template that notes exactly which keys to include (and nothing else) and what data type is expected. A prompt might start with: \n\n  \"Extract the following details from the provided invoice text and return only valid JSON with these keys: 'invoice_number', 'CIF', 'total', 'invoice_date', 'VAT', etc. Do not include any explanation or extra commentary — just output the JSON.\"\n\n2. Use system-level instructions. If you have control over the API call, use a system message that sets the task context. For example:\n\n  \"You are a data extraction agent. Your only output should be valid JSON. Do not provide any commentary, explanation, or additional keys beyond what is specified.\"\n\n3. Provide an explicit JSON template. By telling the model exactly what your expected JSON should look like (even if empty/null fields), you help guide it to output the right structure. For example:\n\n  {\n   \"invoice_number\": \"...\",\n   \"CIF\": \"...\",\n   \"total\": 0.00,\n   \"invoice_date\": \"YYYY-MM-DD\",\n   \"VAT\": 0.00\n  }\n\n4. Ask for a “strict” JSON output. In your prompt, emphasize that nothing except the requested JSON should be returned. You can say:\n\n  \"Return only the JSON object, do not wrap it in markdown or code fences, and include no additional commentary.\"\n\n5. Validate the output programmatically. Once you receive the response from ChatGPT, you can use your code to validate the JSON. For instance, in your application code, try parsing it with a JSON parser. If it fails, flag it for manual review or re-prompt the model.\n\n6. Consider using temperature and max_tokens settings. Setting a lower temperature can reduce creative extra output. Also, setting a max_tokens value appropriately can help keep the response lean and to the point.\n\n7. Use your extraction tool before ChatGPT if needed. Since ChatGPT doesn’t directly “read” PDF files (unless you transcribe or extract text via OCR or another tool), pre-extract the invoice content into text and then send that text to the API with your extraction prompt. This separation helps control the input and enables you to preformat or clean up the document content.\n\n8. Test with real examples. Because invoices can vary in format, run tests with several invoices to ensure consistency. This way, you can adjust your prompt’s wording if you see that the assistant tends to include extra data or commentary.\n\nBy implementing these methods, you’ll have more control over the output. This reduces the risk of receiving extra information that could lead to misunderstandings—or worse—if your boss expects strictly formatted JSON and there’s a time crunch. \n\nRemember: the clearer the instructions, the better ChatGPT can follow them. With a well-defined prompt and appropriate control over API parameters, you should be able to reliably get just the JSON that you need, avoiding any extra data that might create issues under tight deadlines.",

          "response": "It looks like your message got cut off at the end. However, based on what you've described, I believe I understand your problem clearly:\n\n### Summary of your issue:\nYou're using OpenAI's API or ChatGPT web interface to extract structured data from PDF invoices, requesting a JSON format output (invoice number, CIF, total, dates, VAT, etc.). But when you upload a real PDF invoice and ask ChatGPT to provide JSON output, the response includes incorrect or extraneous data, or possibly even data that wasn't present in the original invoice.\n\n### Why does this happen?\n- **Hallucinations**: ChatGPT or GPT-based models can sometimes generate plausible-sounding but incorrect text if they aren't provided with clear, structured data as input.\n- **PDF Parsing Issues**: PDFs are complex documents, and often the text extracted from a PDF file by automated tools can be noisy, inconsistent, or contain formatting issues.\n- **Prompt Issues**: If your prompt to ChatGPT isn't specific enough, the model may misunderstand your intention or provide unwanted/distracting information.\n\n---\n\n## Immediate Solution (within your 30-minute window):\n\n### 1\\. Extract PDF Text First (Reliable Method)\nInstead of directly feeding raw PDF content to ChatGPT, first use a dedicated PDF extraction tool to convert the PDF into text. Some fast, reliable, and free tools for quickly extracting text from PDFs are:\n\n- **Online tools**:\n  - [https://smallpdf.com/pdf-to-text](https://smallpdf.com/pdf-to-text)\n  - [https://pdftotext.com/](https://pdftotext.com/)\n- **Python libraries**:\n  ```bash\n  pip install PyMuPDF\n  ```\n  Quick Python snippet:\n  ```python\n  import fitz\n  \n  doc = fitz.open(\"invoice.pdf\")\n  text = \"\"\n  for page in doc:\n      text += page.get_text()\n  \n  print(text)\n  ```\n\nExtract the text from your PDF invoice first and then copy that text (not the PDF itself) into ChatGPT.\n\n---\n\n### 2\\. Use a Clear and Precise Prompt (Example Below):\nAfter extracting plain text from the PDF, use a prompt similar to this:\n\n```\nBelow is the text extracted from an invoice. Extract ONLY the following keys as JSON data:\n- invoice_number\n- CIF\n- invoice_date\n- due_date\n- total_amount\n- VAT_amount\n\nIf any field is missing, leave it as null. Provide ONLY valid JSON format.\n\nInvoice Text:\n\"\"\"\n[Paste the extracted invoice text here]\n\"\"\"\n```\n\nThe explicit instruction \"Provide ONLY valid JSON format\" and clearly specifying desired fields significantly improves accuracy.\n\n---\n\n### 3\\. Example JSON output you should expect:\n```json\n{\n    \"invoice_number\": \"INV-2023-1002\",\n    \"CIF\": \"B12345678\",\n    \"invoice_date\": \"2023-10-18\",\n    \"due_date\": \"2023-11-18\",\n    \"total_amount\": \"1500.00\",\n    \"VAT_amount\": \"315.00\"\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n## Long-Term Solution (Beyond immediate 30-min window):\n\nTo avoid future issues, consider automating the extraction process with a dedicated PDF parsing tool or OCR tool before calling ChatGPT/OpenAI API:\n\n- **OCR tools**: Tesseract OCR (for scanned PDFs)\n- **Structured PDF extraction libraries**: `pdfplumber`, `PyMuPDF`, `PDFMiner.six`\n- **Dedicated invoice parsing APIs**: Docparser, Rossum, Veryfi, or similar services specifically built for invoice data extraction.\n\n---\n\n## If you're still stuck:\nPlease provide the exact problematic response from ChatGPT and/or your current prompt, and I will immediately help correct it.\n\nLet me know if this resolves your issue or if you need further immediate assistance.",

To extract the required information from PDF invoices using the OpenAI API, you can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Prepare the PDF file**: Ensure that the PDF invoice you need to extract data from is in a format that the OpenAI API can process. The API can handle most standard PDF files, but it's always a good idea to test it with a sample file first.\n\n2. **Set up the OpenAI API**: If you haven't already, you'll need to set up your OpenAI API credentials and integrate them into your code. You can find detailed instructions on the OpenAI website.\n\n3. **Write the code to extract the data**: Here's an example of how you can use the OpenAI API to extract the required information from a PDF invoice and return it as a JSON output:\n\n```python\nimport os\nimport openai\n\n# Set up your OpenAI API credentials\nopenai.api_key = \"your_api_key_here\"\n\n# Define the PDF file path\npdf_file_path = \"path/to/your/invoice.pdf\"\n\n# Define the prompt for the API\nprompt = f\"Extract the following information from the PDF invoice: invoice number, CIF, total, dates, VAT. Return the result as a JSON object.\"\n\n# Open the PDF file and read its contents\nwith open(pdf_file_path, \"rb\") as file:\n    pdf_content = file.read()\n\n# Use the OpenAI API to extract the data\nresponse = openai.Completion.create(\n    engine=\"text-davinci-002\",\n    prompt=prompt,\n    max_tokens=1024,\n    n=1,\n    stop=None,\n    temperature=0.5,\n    input=pdf_content\n)\n\n# Extract the JSON output from the API response\njson_output = response.choices[0].text.strip()\n\n# Print the JSON output\nprint(json_output)\n```\n\nThis code assumes that you have the necessary libraries (such as `openai`) installed and that you've replaced `\"your_api_key_here\"` with your actual OpenAI API key.\n\n4. **Test and refine the code**: Run the code with a sample PDF invoice and inspect the output. Adjust the prompt or the code as needed to ensure that the extracted data is accurate and in the desired format.\n\nRemember that the OpenAI API has usage limits and pricing, so be mindful of your usage and costs.

It sounds like you’re using OpenAI’s API (and/or ChatGPT web) to extract structured data (like invoice number, CIF, total, dates, VAT, etc.) from PDF invoices, and you’re running into an issue: the JSON output sometimes contains data that is hallucinated, incomplete, or not perfectly extracted from the invoice.\n\nHere’s a breakdown of why this happens and some tips to improve your results:\n\n---\n\n## Why is ChatGPT Outputting Incorrect Data from PDFs?\n\n1. **PDF Parsing Limitations:**  \n   ChatGPT (and GPT models in general) do not natively “read” PDF files. When you upload a PDF, a preprocessing step converts the PDF to text (via OCR or PDF-to-text extraction). This process can:\n   - Miss some text (e.g., in images or complex layouts)\n   - Misinterpret tables or columns\n   - Lose context (headers, footers, etc.)\n\n2. **Hallucination:**  \n   If the model can’t find a specific value (e.g., invoice number), it might “guess” or hallucinate plausible data to fill the required JSON fields, even if that data wasn’t actually present in the input.\n\n3. **Ambiguity and Variability:**  \n   Invoices come in many formats, with variable field names and positions, which can confuse the extraction process.\n\n---\n\n## How to Improve Data Extraction Quality\n\n### 1. Preprocess the PDF Carefully\n- **Use high-quality OCR:** If your PDF is a scan, use a robust OCR tool (like Tesseract or Adobe OCR) to convert it to text.\n- **Extract text yourself:** Before sending to the API, extract the PDF text and review it for completeness and accuracy.\n\n### 2. Prompt Engineering\n- **Be explicit:** Tell ChatGPT to only use data found in the input, and to leave fields blank or null if not found.\n- **Provide examples:** Show a sample JSON with missing values (e.g., `\"vat_number\": null`) so the model knows not to hallucinate.\n\n#### Example Prompt:\n```\nYou are a data extraction assistant. Extract ONLY the following fields from the provided invoice text. Output a JSON object with these keys: invoice_number, CIF, total, date, VAT. If a field is missing, set its value to null. Do not guess or invent data.\n\n[PASTE OCR/TEXT HERE]\n```\n\n### 3. Post-processing and Validation\n- **Check outputs:** Use automated scripts to validate the extracted JSON, flagging fields that don’t match expected patterns (e.g., invoice numbers, dates, VAT numbers).\n- **Manual review:** For critical applications, human review may still be necessary.\n\n### 4. Alternative Approaches\n- **Structured extraction tools:** Consider specialized invoice extraction services (e.g., AWS Textract, Google Document AI, Rossum) for higher accuracy on complex documents.\n- **Fine-tuned models:** If you have a large dataset of your invoices, fine-tuning a model on your specific layouts/fields can improve accuracy.\n\n---\n\n## Summary Table\n\n| Challenge                | Solution                                               |\n|--------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|\n| PDF to text errors       | Use robust OCR/text extraction, check output           |\n| Hallucinated data        | Instruct model not to guess, use null for missing data |\n| Variable invoice layouts | Provide examples, use specialized extraction tools     |\n| Validation               | Use regex or scripts to check/clean JSON output        |\n\n---\n\n**If you share a redacted sample of your invoice text and your exact prompt, I can give more tailored advice or a better prompt!**\n\nLet me know if you’d like sample code for preprocessing PDFs, optimized prompts, or more info on extraction tools.",

Provide a Clear and Strict Prompt\n─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nMake sure your prompt is explicit about the output format. For example, include language along the lines of:\n\n• System message or “role=system”:\n  \"You are a data extraction assistant. When given an invoice, you will reply ONLY with valid JSON that includes the following keys: invoice_number, CIF, total, date, VAT. DO NOT include any additional text. DO NOT wrap your JSON in markdown. The fields must be strictly in JSON format.\"\n\n• User message or “role=user”:\n  \"Here is the text from an invoice: [invoice text]. Please extract the required values and return JSON with the keys: ‘invoice_number’, ‘CIF’, ‘total’, ‘date’, ‘VAT’. Only return JSON, nothing else.\"\n\nThis prompt clarifies both the user’s and the system’s roles to produce only JSON, preventing disclaimers or other extraneous text.\n\n─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n2. Use “function calling” (If Applicable)\n─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nOpenAI introduced a “function calling” feature that let you provide ChatGPT with a function signature describing the desired JSON structure. ChatGPT will then return structured JSON data matching that signature. If that feature is available to you, it can significantly improve consistency in responses.\n\nFor instance:\n{\n  \"name\": \"extract_invoice_data\",\n  \"description\": \"Extract invoice data from text\",\n  \"parameters\": {\n    \"type\": \"object\",\n    \"properties\": {\n      \"invoice_number\": {\"type\": \"string\"},\n      \"CIF\": {\"type\": \"string\"},\n      \"total\": {\"type\": \"string\"},\n      \"date\": {\"type\": \"string\"},\n      \"VAT\": {\"type\": \"string\"}\n    },\n    \"required\": [\"invoice_number\", \"CIF\", \"total\", \"date\", \"VAT\"]\n  }\n}\n\nWith function calling, ChatGPT is more likely to produce only the JSON object without additional commentary.\n\n─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n3. Preprocess the PDF Content\n─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nChatGPT works best when you feed it clean text. PDFs often contain extra formatting artifacts (line breaks, hidden characters, truncated text, etc.). If you notice that ChatGPT is hallucinating or providing unexpected text, try using a PDF parsing library (such as PyPDF2, pdfminer, or other PDF-to-text tools) to extract and clean the text before passing it to ChatGPT. This helps reduce noise that might be misread as actual content.\n\n─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n4. Use Temperature and Other Parameters\n─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nTo encourage ChatGPT to be concise and consistent, you might consider:\n\n• Setting temperature close to 0 (e.g., temperature=0 or 0.1). Lower temperature encourages more deterministic and focused outputs (less creativity).  \n• Setting max_tokens to a smaller range that forces the model to provide shorter, more direct responses.  \n• Providing strong instruction for “formatting only” (restate your requirement for JSON with no extra text).\n\n─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n5. Post-Processing or Validation\n─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nBecause large language models can still occasionally insert disclaimers or “helpful” text, it’s prudent to validate the output in your code:\n\n• If the response contains any characters outside the JSON (e.g., “Sure!” or markdown formatting), programmatically trim or parse only the valid JSON.  \n• Use a JSON parser and handle exceptions—if the response does not parse cleanly, you can reissue the prompt or parse out the extraneous text.  \n\n─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n6. Sample Prompt\n─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nBelow is an example of how you might structure a “role=system” and “role=user” set of messages to push ChatGPT toward a JSON-only output:\n\nSystem Message:\n\"You are a data extraction assistant that returns strictly valid JSON. Do not include any additional text. The JSON you return must have the following structure:  \n{\n  'invoice_number': 'string',\n  'CIF': 'string',\n  'total': 'string',\n  'date': 'string',\n  'VAT': 'string'\n}\nNever include markdown formatting or any text outside this JSON.\"\n\nUser Message:\n\"Extract the data from this invoice text and return only the JSON:  \n-----  \n[PASTE INVOICE TEXT HERE]  \n-----\"\n\n─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n\nFollowing these guidelines will help constrain ChatGPT to produce strictly JSON content and reduce extraneous text. If you still see spurious data in the output, tighten your prompt further or consider the function-calling approach for a higher degree of reliability.",

          "response": "Below is some expertise and potential guidance on the issue you’re encountering with data extraction from PDF invoices via OpenAI’s API and ChatGPT web interface.\n\n1. PDF-to-text preprocessing:  \n • ChatGPT and similar models work on text input. Make sure any PDF is properly converted (via OCR or a PDF-to-text library) so that the content (numbers, labels, etc.) is extracted cleanly. Ambiguous or jumbled text can cause the model to “misread” which may lead to additional / unexpected keys in the output.  \n • Check for hidden formatting artifacts (line breaks, headers/footers, etc.) that might confuse the extraction process.\n\n2. Crafting a clear and constrained prompt:  \n • When asking ChatGPT to output only a specific JSON structure, it’s crucial to include an instruction that is both explicit and unambiguous. For instance, you can state, “Extract the following keys only: invoiceNumber, CIF, total, dates, VAT. Provide a valid JSON object with these keys and no additional commentary or keys.”  \n • Prompt engineering is key. Sometimes the model might “over-answer” if it isn’t strictly bound by the instruction. You might need to reiterate that the response should contain exactly and only the JSON output.\n\n3. System and developer instructions:  \n • When using the API, consider using a system-level message (if available) to instruct the model on format. For example, “When replying, output only a JSON object with no explanations or extra text.”  \n • This helps to enforce the output format and can reduce the risk of additional narrative text being included.\n\n4. Handling ambiguous or overlapping text in invoices:  \n • Real invoices may contain extra textual information that can be misinterpreted. For example, if a page contains elements that resemble the keys you’re looking for (like dates or numbers not relevant to the invoice), the model might pick them up.  \n • Try to pre-process and isolate the parts of the text that are relevant, or explicitly instruct the model which sections of the text to use for extraction.\n\n5. Security considerations and injection risks:  \n • Both from an AI security standpoint and correct operation, be mindful of potential “prompt injection” scenarios. If the PDF invoice content is untrusted, it might contain stray text designed to offset your prompt instructions.  \n • Validate and sanitize your input before feeding it to the model where possible.\n\n6. Iterative refinement and testing:  \n • Start with a simpler invoice example and see if the model reliably returns exactly the JSON structure you expect.  \n • Gradually increase the complexity until you can pinpoint exactly where extra data begins to appear. Using a few test cases may help refine your prompt instructions.\n\n7. Alternative approaches:  \n • Depending on how structured your invoices are, you might consider building a dedicated pre-processing pipeline (using regular expressions or NLP parsing techniques) that extracts likely candidate strings for invoice numbers, totals, etc. Then, feed these candidates into ChatGPT for confirmation or formatting.  \n • This two-tier approach might reduce the burden on ChatGPT and standardize your input, reducing unwanted extra keys.\n\nIn summary, ensure that the PDF-to-text conversion is clean, craft precise prompt instructions (perhaps leveraging system messages or clear “only JSON” directives), and consider pre-processing the content to isolate relevant parts. These steps not only help avoid unwanted extra data but also reduce the chances of prompt injection or misinterpretation by the model.\n\nI hope this provides a useful overview of potential issues and solutions for your use case. If you have follow-up questions or need specific examples of prompts or code snippets, feel free to ask!",

          "response": "It seems your message got cut off, but based on what you've described, you appear to be encountering an issue where ChatGPT/OpenAI's API returns unexpected or inaccurate data when extracting structured information from PDF invoices.\n\nThis is a common issue when relying solely on OpenAI models like ChatGPT for direct PDF data extraction, as these models are primarily language-based and not specifically trained or optimized for structured data extraction directly from complex documents. Common issues include:\n\n- **Hallucinated or incorrect data:** GPT models sometimes generate plausible but incorrect outputs if the input is ambiguous, unclear, or if they don’t have direct visibility into the document's exact formatting and layout.\n- **Inconsistent Results:** Depending on how clearly the data is presented in the PDF, the model might return inconsistent JSON structures.\n- **Missing or Additional Fields:** The model may occasionally skip certain fields or add fields that were not requested.\n\n### Recommended Solutions and Best Practices:\n\n1. **Text Extraction Preprocessing**  \n   Consider extracting text from the PDF first using specialized PDF parsing libraries:\n   - **Python Libraries:** `pdfplumber`, `PyMuPDF`, `PyPDF2`, `pdfminer.six`\n   - **JavaScript Libraries:** `pdf-lib`, `pdf.js`\n   - These libraries can reliably extract text, tables, and other structured content from PDFs before feeding the text into the OpenAI API.\n\n2. **Structured Prompt Engineering**  \n   Clearly define your JSON structure in the prompt. For instance:\n   ```\n   Extract the following fields from the invoice:\n   - Invoice Number\n   - CIF\n   - Total Amount\n   - Invoice Date\n   - Due Date\n   - VAT Amount\n   \n   Provide your response strictly in this JSON format:\n   {\n     \"invoice_number\": \"\",\n     \"cif\": \"\",\n     \"total_amount\": \"\",\n     \"invoice_date\": \"\",\n     \"due_date\": \"\",\n     \"vat_amount\": \"\"\n   }\n   If any field is missing, leave the corresponding value empty.\n   ```\n   Providing such structured prompts significantly reduces model misunderstandings.\n\n3. **Few-Shot Examples**  \n   Giving the model one or two clearly defined examples greatly helps it understand exactly what type of data and formatting you expect. For example:\n   ```\n   Example:\n   Text:\n   \"Invoice No.: INV-1234\n   CIF: A12345678\n   Total: 1,200 €\n   Date: 2023-05-01\n   Due Date: 2023-05-15\n   VAT: 252 €\"\n   \n   JSON:\n   {\n     \"invoice_number\": \"INV-1234\",\n     \"cif\": \"A12345678\",\n     \"total_amount\": \"1200\",\n     \"invoice_date\": \"2023-05-01\",\n     \"due_date\": \"2023-05-15\",\n     \"vat_amount\": \"252\"\n   }\n   ```\n\n4. **Post-processing & Validation**  \n   After receiving the output from OpenAI, run a validation step:\n   - Check the JSON format and keys.\n   - Confirm that extracted values match expected patterns (regex validation for invoice numbers, dates, amounts, etc.).\n\n5. **Use Specialized Solutions for Structured Document Extraction**  \n   If your use case is mission-critical or requires high accuracy, considering specialized OCR/document parsing solutions might be appropriate, such as:\n   - **AWS Textract**, **Google Document AI**, **Azure Form Recognizer**\n   - These tools are designed specifically for structured document processing and can significantly improve accuracy. You could then optionally combine the outputs from these tools with GPT models for further refinement or formatting.\n\n---\n\nIf you provide more details on your specific issue (for example, the exact problematic output you're receiving, the PDF's layout complexity, or your complete prompt), I can better tailor my recommendations to your scenario.",

Data Extraction: OpenAI's models (including GPT-3 and GPT-4) are primarily language models and are not specifically designed for structured data extraction from documents like PDFs. While they can attempt to interpret and extract information from text, their accuracy for this task may vary.\n\n2. JSON Output: You can instruct the model to format its response as JSON, but you'll need to be very explicit in your prompts about the exact structure you want.\n\n3. Accuracy Issues: The model might sometimes \"hallucinate\" or generate data that isn't actually present in the invoice. This is especially likely if the PDF content isn't clearly visible to the model (e.g., if it's an image-based PDF).\n\n4. Alternative Solutions: For more reliable invoice data extraction, you might want to consider specialized OCR (Optical Character Recognition) and data extraction tools designed specifically for this purpose.\n\n5. Prompt Engineering: If you continue using OpenAI's API, you'll need to experiment with different prompts to get the most accurate results. Be very specific about what you're looking for and the format you want.\n\n6. Validation: It's crucial to have a human review the extracted data or implement additional validation checks, as the model's output may not always be 100% accurate.\n\nIf you're experiencing specific issues or errors, it would be helpful to know more details about the problem you're encountering.

Unless prompted very explicitly, it may add explanations, comments, or guess missing values.\n- PDF extraction can be noisy: OCR errors or inconsistent layouts can confuse the model.\n- The model may try to be helpful and \"fill in\" missing info, even if it's not present in the PDF.\n\n---\n\n### Recommendations\n\n#### 1. **Prompt Engineering**\nBe very explicit in your prompt. For example:\n> Extract ONLY the following fields from this invoice and return as a JSON object with these keys: `invoice_number`, `CIF`, `total`, `date`, `VAT`.  \n> - If a field is missing, set its value to `null`.  \n> - Do not include any explanation, comments, or extra fields.  \n> - Respond ONLY with the JSON object.\n\n#### 2. **Post-processing**\n- After receiving the response, use code to validate the JSON structure.\n- Use a JSON schema to ensure only the expected keys are present, and strip out any unexpected data.\n\n#### 3. **Chunking the PDF**\n- Extract the text from the PDF first (using a library like `pdfplumber`, `PyPDF2`, or `pdf.js`).\n- Send only the relevant text to the API, instead of the whole PDF, to reduce confusion.\n\n#### 4. **Few-shot Examples**\n- If possible, include one or two examples in your prompt showing exactly the desired output format.\n\n#### 5. **API Parameters**\n- Use the `response_format: 'json_object'` parameter if you are using the OpenAI API v2, which enforces valid JSON output (as of June 2024).\n\n---\n\n### Example Prompt\n\nHere’s a sample API prompt that works well:\n\n```\nYou are an invoice data extractor. Given the following invoice text, extract the following fields: invoice_number, CIF, total, date, VAT.  \nRespond only with a valid JSON object in this format:\n{\n  \"invoice_number\": \"\",\n  \"CIF\": \"\",\n  \"total\": \"\",\n  \"date\": \"\",\n  \"VAT\": \"\"\n}\nIf a field is missing, set its value to null.\nInvoice text:\n[PASTE INVOICE TEXT HERE]\n```\n\n---\n\n### Example Post-processing (JavaScript)\n\n```javascript\nfunction cleanAndValidate(jsonString) {\n    try {\n        const data = JSON.parse(jsonString);\n        const allowedKeys = ['invoice_number', 'CIF', 'total', 'date', 'VAT'];\n        // Remove any extra keys\n        Object.keys(data).forEach(key => {\n            if (!allowedKeys.includes(key)) delete data[key];\n        });\n        // Ensure all keys are present\n        allowedKeys.forEach(key => {\n            if (!(key in data)) data[key] = null;\n        });\n        return data;\n    } catch (e) {\n        console.error('Invalid JSON:', e);\n        return null;\n    }\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n### Summary\n\n- **Be explicit in your prompt.**\n- **Use JSON schema validation on the output.**\n- **Pre-extract plain text from the PDF before sending to ChatGPT.**\n- **Use the latest API features if possible.**\n\nIf you provide more details about your workflow (e.g., which programming language, libraries, etc.), I can offer more tailored code examples!",

          "response": "Below is a high-level outline of how you might streamline your “extract invoice data as JSON” workflow so that you receive only JSON with the keys you want. This focuses on prompt design, using the newer function-calling approach (if available), and post-processing to ensure valid JSON.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------\n1) Extract Text from PDF\n------------------------------------------------------------\n• Use a PDF parsing library (e.g., PyPDF2 in Python, pdfplumber, or any other tool) to extract the raw text of the invoice.  \n• Ensure you have the full text content ready before sending it to OpenAI.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------\n2) Use a Function Calling Approach (Recommended if using the ChatGPT 0613+ API)\n------------------------------------------------------------\nOpenAI’s function calling lets you define the structure of the JSON you expect. You provide the model with a function signature (in JSON Schema–like format) that enforces the fields and their types. The model will respond with a structured JSON result that you can parse programmatically.\n\nBelow is pseudocode in JavaScript for how that might look if you’re calling the OpenAI API directly:\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------\nPseudocode: Using OpenAI Function Calling\n----------------------------------------------------------------\n// 1. Define the function schema that describes the JSON structure you want:\nconst invoiceExtractionFunction = {\n  name: \"extract_invoice_data\",  \n  description: \"Extracts invoice data fields and returns them in a structured format\",\n  parameters: {\n    type: \"object\",\n    properties: {\n      invoice_number: { type: \"string\", description: \"Invoice number\" },\n      CIF: { type: \"string\", description: \"Tax identification number\" },\n      total: { type: \"string\", description: \"Total amount on the invoice\" },\n      date: { type: \"string\", description: \"Date of the invoice\" },\n      VAT: { type: \"string\", description: \"VAT amount or percentage\" }\n    },\n    // Set additional properties to false if you want to strictly limit\n    additionalProperties: false,\n    required: [\"invoice_number\", \"CIF\", \"total\", \"date\", \"VAT\"]\n  }\n};\n\nasync function extractInvoiceData(pdfText) {\n  // 2. Prepare your messages. \n  //   - The first item in the array could be your system or role instructions.\n  //   - Then a user message that provides the PDF text and asks for extraction.\n\n  const completion = await openai.createChatCompletion({\n    model: \"gpt-3.5-turbo-0613\", \n    messages: [\n      {\n        role: \"system\",\n        content: \"You are a helpful assistant that extracts relevant data from invoices.\"\n      },\n      {\n        role: \"user\",\n        content: `Extract the following fields from this invoice text: \n                  invoice_number, CIF, total, date, VAT.\n                  Return only valid JSON with no extra commentary.`,\n      },\n      {\n        role: \"user\",\n        content: pdfText\n      }\n    ],\n    functions: [invoiceExtractionFunction],\n    function_call: { name: \"extract_invoice_data\" }\n  });\n\n  // 3. The model will return a JSON response following your function schema.\n  //    You can then parse or directly use the structured response:\n  const responseMessage = completion.data.choices[0].message;\n\n  if (responseMessage.function_call) {\n    const extractedData = JSON.parse(responseMessage.function_call.arguments);\n    return extractedData; // This should contain { invoice_number, CIF, total, date, VAT }\n  }\n\n  // If no function_call, handle fallback logic:\n  return null;\n}\n\n------------------------------------------------------------\n3) If You Cannot Use Function Calling\n------------------------------------------------------------\nIf you’re not using function calling (e.g., older model endpoints), you can still heavily instruct the model to return valid JSON. Often you’ll send something like this in your prompt:\n\n\"Please extract the following data fields from the text I provide: invoice_number, CIF, total, date, and VAT. Return only a valid JSON object with the keys exactly as:  \n{  \n  'invoice_number': '',  \n  'CIF': '',  \n  'total': '',  \n  'date': '',  \n  'VAT': ''  \n}  \nDo not include any additional disclaimers, explanations, or text. If a field is missing, provide an empty string for that field.\"\n\nEven with that, sometimes the model might include extra text. You can safeguard by:\n• Searching within the response for a JSON-like substring and parsing it with a JSON parser.  \n• Using a robust JSON extraction technique (e.g., a regex to find the first “{...}” block and parse).  \n• Adding a post-processing step that tries to parse the entire text as JSON, and if that fails, tries to parse the substring.  \n\n------------------------------------------------------------\n4) Post-Processing to Ensure Valid JSON\n------------------------------------------------------------\nIf the raw response ever includes disclaimers or extra text, you can:\n1. Use a regex to find the first curly bracket “{” and the last curly bracket “}” in the response.  \n2. Extract that substring.  \n3. Validate it with JSON.parse (in JavaScript) or an equivalent in your language.  \n4. If it fails, you might re-run the request or attempt to fix common JSON formatting issues (like trailing commas).\n\nExample snippet in JavaScript to sanitize the response:\n\nfunction extractJson(responseText) {\n  const startIndex = responseText.indexOf(\"{\");\n  const endIndex = responseText.lastIndexOf(\"}\");\n  if (startIndex !== -1 && endIndex !== -1 && endIndex > startIndex) {\n    const jsonString = responseText.slice(startIndex, endIndex + 1);\n    try {\n      return JSON.parse(jsonString);\n    } catch (error) {\n      console.error(\"Error parsing JSON:\", error);\n      return null;\n    }\n  }\n  return null;\n}\n\n------------------------------------------------------------\nSummary\n------------------------------------------------------------\n• Use the function calling feature (if possible) to ensure the model respects your JSON schema.  \n• Otherwise, craft a careful prompt telling the model to return JSON-only.  \n• Still parse and sanitize on your side—never fully trust unstructured text.  \n\nWith these adjustments, you should get minimal extra commentary and a clean JSON response containing only the data you need from the invoice.",

Here are some strategies and adjustments you can try to help the model stick to your requirements:\n\n1. Clarify your prompt instructions:  \n • Be very specific that the output must contain only a valid JSON object with the keys you require (e.g., invoice_number, CIF, total, dates, VAT, etc.).  \n • If possible, include an example of the expected JSON output in your prompt. For example:  \n  \n  {\n    \"invoice_number\": \"12345\",\n    \"CIF\": \"A12345678\",\n    \"total\": \"1000.00\",\n    \"dates\": \"2023-10-01\",\n    \"VAT\": \"21%\"\n  }\n\n2. Use system-level instructions (if using the API) or a system message (in ChatGPT web):  \n • You can provide a system message that instructs the assistant to output only valid JSON with no extra text or comments. For example:  \n  \n  \"You are an assistant that only outputs valid JSON based on the provided invoice data. Do not include additional commentary or text.\"  \n  \n This can help guide the output.\n\n3. Use delimiters:  \n • Consider asking the assistant to wrap the output in code blocks or delimit the JSON with a start/end marker so that you can easily extract the JSON part.  \n • For example, instruct: \"Return the JSON output wrapped in triple backticks.\"\n\n4. Postprocessing:  \n • If some extra text is still present in the response, you might consider writing a simple parser or filter in your code that extracts the JSON. For instance, if the valid JSON is between specific delimiters, your code can extract that snippet and then parse it.\n\n5. Fine-tune your extraction strategy:  \n • If you’re extracting fields from a PDF invoice, ensure that your initial text extraction from the PDF is as clean as possible. Sometimes, noise in the input text can lead to ambiguous responses.\n • If needed, preprocess your invoice text using OCR or a PDF extraction tool before sending it to the API, so the assistant has a clean text reference.\n\n6. Example implementation adjustment:  \n If you’re building this in code, you might structure your function like so:\n\n  function executeTask(pdfData) {\n   // Step 1: Extract text from the PDF (using your preferred library).\n   const extractedText = extractTextFromPDF(pdfData);\n   \n   // Step 2: Prepare the prompt message with clear instructions and an example JSON.\n   const prompt = `\n     Extract the following fields from the invoice text below:\n     - invoice_number\n     - CIF\n     - total\n     - dates\n     - VAT\n  \n     Output only a valid JSON object with these keys and nothing else.\n     \n     Invoice Text:\n     ${extractedText}\n   `;\n   \n   // Step 3: Call the OpenAI API with the prompt.\n   callOpenAIApi(prompt)\n     .then(response => {\n       // Extract the JSON from response (if needed, post-process to isolate JSON).\n       console.log('Received JSON:', response);\n     })\n     .catch(error => {\n       console.error('Error processing request:', error);\n     });\n  }\n\nThis way, your prompt and API call are carefully structured to instruct the assistant clearly.\n\nBy combining clear prompt engineering with any necessary post-processing, you should be able to get the response to closely match your desired JSON structure without additional commentary.",

Prepare OpenAI Prompt\n    2.1. Clearly specify desired JSON output keys:\n        - invoice_number\n        - CIF\n        - total_amount\n        - invoice_date\n        - due_date\n        - VAT_amount\n        - currency\n        - supplier_name\n        - customer_name\n        - any other required keys\n    2.2. Provide a clear instruction in prompt:\n        \"Extract data from the provided invoice text strictly as JSON with only the following keys: [list keys here]. Do not include any additional explanations or unrelated details.\"\n\n    Example Prompt Structure:\n        \"Extract from the invoice text below ONLY the following fields as a JSON object:\n           {\n             \"invoice_number\": \"\",\n             \"CIF\": \"\",\n             \"total_amount\": \"\",\n             \"invoice_date\": \"\",\n             \"due_date\": \"\",\n             \"VAT_amount\": \"\",\n             \"currency\": \"\",\n             \"supplier_name\": \"\",\n             \"customer_name\": \"\"\n           }\n         Invoice text: [paste invoice text here]\"\n\n3.

          "response": "Below is one way to formalize and describe the function f, given the text you provided as its input. Of course, there is more than one way to define such a function; the following is an illustrative example.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n1. Definition of the Function\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n• Let S be the set of all strings (e.g., English texts) describing a request to extract data from PDF invoices.  \n• Let T be the set of all possible JSON outputs that might contain keys such as \"invoice number,\" \"CIF,\" \"total,\" \"dates,\" \"VAT,\" etc.\n\nDefine the function  \n  f : S → T  \nsuch that for any input string s ∈ S (e.g., the text “Hello, I’m using OpenAI’s API … the response contains data tha”), f(s) = t ∈ T, where t is a JSON-style output that includes the requested invoice data (or attempts to), possibly along with extraneous text or disclaimers.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n2. Domain\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n• Domain (S): All strings (requests) describing the desire to extract structured data from PDF invoices using ChatGPT or OpenAI’s API.  \n• Example of an element in the domain (the user’s input):  \n  \"Hello,I’m using OpenAI’s API (and ChatGPT web) to extract data from PDF invoices, requesting only a JSON output with specific keys, such as invoice number, CIF, total, dates, VAT, etc.  \n   Problem: When I upload a real PDF invoice and ask ChatGPT to extract the data as JSON, the response contains data tha...\"\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n3. Codomain and Range\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n• Codomain (T): The set of all possible JSON-formatted outputs that could be returned by the system in response to invoice-data extraction requests.  \n  - For instance, T includes JSON objects with keys like { \"invoice_number\", \"CIF\", \"total\", \"dates\", \"VAT\" }, possibly accompanied by additional fields.  \n\n• Range: The actual subset of T that f produces for inputs in S. Since the system can produce disclaimers or additional text outside the strictly requested JSON, or might misformat the JSON, the actual range could include partially correct JSON or text plus JSON-like structures.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n4. Mapping Properties\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\na) Totality  \n   – Is f defined for every input in S?  \n     In principle, yes. If S includes any textual request for extracting invoice data, ChatGPT (or a similar system) will produce some output (possibly a JSON block combined with additional text). Thus, f can be considered a total function on S, because for every string s describing the request, f(s) returns some response t.\n\nb) Injectivity (One-to-One)  \n   – Is f injective?  \n     Likely not. Two different requests in S could yield the same (or very similar) JSON output, particularly if they contain the same or highly similar wording. Consequently, it is not guaranteed that distinct elements in S produce distinct elements in T.\n\nc) Surjectivity (Onto)  \n   – Is f surjective onto T?  \n     Also unlikely. Although T is broad (it includes all potential JSON outputs of a certain form), there’s no guarantee that for every possible JSON object t, there exists an input s in S such that f(s) = t. Many JSON objects in T might never be produced by the system for any realistic request.\n\nd) Determinism  \n   – For a given exact input s, does the function always return the same output t?  \n     Not necessarily. ChatGPT or an API-based system can produce different outputs for the same input s depending on context, model variability, or system updates. Hence, f can appear non-deterministic in practice.\n\ne) Completeness of Extracted Fields  \n   – Ideally, f(s) should produce a JSON object containing fields like invoice_number, CIF, total, dates, VAT, or a subset of those fields if they exist in the invoice. However, due to model behavior, f(s) may produce extraneous data, incomplete data, or disclaimers.\n\nf) Correctness  \n   – Whether the output faithfully reproduces the requested fields depends on the correctness of the underlying reasoning (the language model). Therefore, f might not always be correct in extracting the right values or might include “hallucinated” data.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n5. Summary\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n• The function f takes textual requests about extracting invoice data as input and returns JSON (or quasi-JSON) as output.  \n• It is a total function on the domain of all such textual requests, but it is neither injective nor necessarily surjective.  \n• Its behavior can be non-deterministic and may include extraneous text or disclaimers.  \n• Ideally, the output would be an accurate JSON with specific keys (invoice number, CIF, total, dates, VAT), but real-world performance can vary depending on document context, model behavior, and prompt engineering.",

          "response": "We can view the task as defining a function\n\n  f: Input → Output\n\nwhere\n\n  Input ∈ I is a text string that includes both a description of what is expected (e.g., “Hello, I’m using OpenAI’s API … to extract data from PDF invoices…”) and the actual content (or reference to content) of a particular PDF invoice, and\n\n  Output ∈ O is a JSON object containing a fixed set of keys such as \"invoice_number\", \"CIF\", \"total\", \"dates\", \"VAT\", etc., where each key’s value is the extracted value from the invoice.\n\nBelow are several mapping properties that this function exhibits:\n\n1. Domain and Codomain:\n • Domain (I): All text inputs that conform to the “instruction + invoice content” pattern. In practice, these inputs contain an English (or otherwise natural‐language) description that tells the system what to extract and (possibly embedded or referenced) unstructured invoice data.\n • Codomain (O): All JSON objects that follow a predetermined schema. For example, each JSON object is required to have keys like \"invoice_number\", \"CIF\", \"total\", \"dates\", \"VAT\", etc. (values may be strings, numbers, or even sub–JSON objects depending on the invoice details).\n\n2. Structure Preservation and Transformation:\n • f acts as a transformer that extracts and “repackages” information. It identifies and extracts data from semi–structured or unstructured text (from the invoice) and maps them to the corresponding JSON keys.\n • The function “preserves” the meaning of the data: even if the invoice contains extra text or the layout is variable, f is intended to pick out only the desired fields and ignore extraneous information.\n\n3. Determinism and Consistency:\n • Ideally, for the same input (or inputs that contain the same invoice data), f produces the same JSON output. (This is the goal in a deterministic parser/extractor though in practice extraction might include probabilistic elements.)\n • f is defined so that each identified section (e.g., the invoice number or the total amount) in the text maps to a unique key in the output; however, if a field is ambiguous or missing the function may still output a JSON with that key either assigned a null value or omitted based on implementation details.\n\n4. Schema–Driven Behavior:\n • The mapping f is schema–driven in that it is designed (or “programmed”) to respond with a JSON that conforms to the specified schema. Even if the invoice contains data beyond what is asked for, f returns only those keys mandated (invoice number, CIF, total, dates, VAT, etc.).\n • This means that f effectively “filters” the input data: it uses the instruction “requesting” only specific keys in the JSON output and discards any fields not matching the schema.\n\n5. Partiality and Error Handling:\n • f is partially defined in the sense that if the input does not include enough context or if the invoice text is malformed, the extraction may fail to produce a sensible JSON value for some fields. In these cases, the mapping might either output placeholder/default values, error messages in certain keys, or omit keys for which no data could be reliably extracted.\n • Thus, f’s definition is tied to the quality and completeness of the invoice input text.\n\n6. Non–Invertibility:\n • f is not one-to-one in general. Many different input texts (perhaps with variations in formatting, language, or ordering) may produce the same JSON output if the key pieces of information are the same.\n • f is also not onto the set of all possible JSON objects; its codomain is restricted to JSON objects that conform to the pre–specified schema.\n\nIn summary, the function f performs the following process:\n\n  For a given input text that contains a description of the extraction task plus raw invoice data,\n  → f extracts specific information corresponding to keys like \"invoice_number\", \"CIF\", \"total\", \"dates\", \"VAT\", etc.,\n  → f then constructs a JSON object that maps each of these keys to its corresponding extracted value.\n\nThis clearly defines the mapping f from an “instruction + invoice text” input to a standardized JSON output with specific keys.",

          "response": "It looks like your message was cut off partway through, but I understand your core issue: When you use OpenAI’s API or ChatGPT web to extract structured data (like JSON) from real PDF invoices, the output often contains hallucinated (invented) or incorrect values instead of the actual data from the document.\n\nHere’s why this happens and some tips to improve extraction accuracy:\n\nWhy hallucination happens:\n\n- OCR Limitations: If you upload a PDF, ChatGPT must first extract the text. If the PDF is not “text-based” (for example, it’s a scanned image), the OCR (optical character recognition) step may introduce errors or miss data.\n- Model Context: If you ask for a specific JSON schema but don’t provide clear context or examples, the model may “fill in the blanks” with plausible but incorrect data, especially if it can’t find the fields in the text.\n- Large PDFs: If the invoice is long or complex, the model may not “see” all the data within its context window.\n\nHow to improve extraction accuracy:\n\n1. Pre-extract Text (if possible):\n   - Use a dedicated PDF-to-text tool (like Adobe Acrobat, Tesseract OCR, or pdfplumber) to extract the raw text first.\n   - Feed only the relevant text of the invoice to ChatGPT with your prompt.\n\n2. Use Clear Prompts and Examples:\n   - Give the model a clear instruction and a sample JSON output with dummy values.\n   - Example prompt:\n     Extract the following fields from this invoice text and output only JSON in this format:\n     {\n       \"invoice_number\": \"\",\n       \"CIF\": \"\",\n       \"total\": \"\",\n       \"date\": \"\",\n       \"VAT\": \"\"\n     }\n     Invoice text: [paste the invoice text here]\n   - This reduces the chance of the model inventing fields or values.\n\n3. Validate Output:\n   - After getting the JSON, use code to automatically check if the fields match the expected patterns (e.g., date format, numbers for total/VAT, etc.).\n   - Flag or discard responses that don’t match.\n\n4. Use API Parameters:\n   - If using the API, set the temperature parameter to 0. This makes the model more deterministic and less prone to inventing values.\n\n5. Consider Specialized Tools:\n   - For production use, consider dedicated invoice extraction tools (like Amazon Textract, Google Document AI, or open-source solutions) that are purpose-built for this task.\n\nSample improved prompt for ChatGPT API:\n\nExtract the following fields from the invoice text below. Only use values that appear directly in the text. If a value is missing, leave it blank. Output only the JSON—no explanation or extra text.\n\n{\n  \"invoice_number\": \"\",\n  \"CIF\": \"\",\n  \"total\": \"\",\n  \"date\": \"\",\n  \"VAT\": \"\"\n}\n\nInvoice text:\n[PASTE RAW INVOICE TEXT HERE]\n\nIf you provide a full sample of your prompt and a sample invoice, I can help you refine it further!\n\nLet me know if you’d like help with the code side or with prompt engineering.",

          "response": "It sounds like you’re encountering the common issue where ChatGPT tries to provide extra text or “hallucinated” data rather than strictly returning the JSON keys and values you’ve requested. Below are some tips and best practices to help you get more consistent, JSON-only responses when extracting structured data from PDF invoices:\n\n1) Provide Context Clearly  \n   • If you’re using the API, consider placing clear instructions in a “system” message (or the highest-priority message in whichever framework you’re using) that states something like:  \n     “You are a data extraction assistant. Your only job is to parse invoice text and return a JSON object with the following keys: [list keys]. If data is missing, return an empty string for that key.”  \n   • If you’re using ChatGPT’s web interface, lead with a statement similar to:  \n     “You are a data extraction assistant. Only output valid JSON with the following structure: … (provide schema) … and do not add text outside of JSON.”\n\n2) Supply the Raw Text from the PDF  \n   • ChatGPT can’t inherently read a PDF file in binary format. If you’re using the API, you have to extract the text first (for example, using a Python library like PyPDF2 or pdfplumber, or other OCR tools if the PDF is not text-based). Then feed the extracted text to ChatGPT.  \n   • Make sure the text you provide to the model is clean and accurate. OCR errors can cause hallucinations or parsing mistakes.\n\n3) Enforce a JSON Schema with Function Calling (if using OpenAI’s API)  \n   • OpenAI recently introduced “function calling,” which lets you define the exact JSON schema you want as a function signature. You can instruct the model to call that function only, ensuring the output is valid JSON in the exact shape you defined.  \n   • This approach is often the most robust for controlling output format and preventing extraneous text.\n\n4) Use “Temperature” and “Top_p” Parameters  \n   • Lowering the “temperature” (e.g., 0 or 0.2) makes the model less “creative.” This helps reduce hallucinations by encouraging the model to stick closely to the instructions and data provided.\n\n5) Reiterate the Instruction to Only Output JSON  \n   • At the end of your prompt, remind ChatGPT:  \n     “Output only JSON. Do not include any other explanations or text outside of JSON.”  \n   • If the response starts to drift, you can prompt again:  \n     “Please repeat your response strictly in JSON without any additional information.”\n\n6) Consider Post-Processing  \n   • Even with these measures, occasionally ChatGPT may provide additional text or formatting.  \n   • In a production workflow, you might parse the raw output with a JSON parser. If there’s extra text, use a simple regex or a JSON schema validator to extract or correct the JSON portion.\n\n7) Validate the Data Fields  \n   • Because ChatGPT can hallucinate or guess missing fields, it’s a good idea to systematically validate the final JSON (e.g., checking that numeric fields are indeed numeric, dates follow a correct format, etc.).  \n   • If validation fails, you can re-prompt or handle the error gracefully.\n\n▌Example Prompt (API or ChatGPT web)\n\nSYSTEM / Highest-Priority Message:\n“You are a data extraction assistant. Your only job is to parse the provided invoice text and return a JSON object with these fields:\n{\n  “invoice_number”: “string”,\n  “CIF”: “string”,\n  “date”: “string”,\n  “VAT”: “number”,\n  “total”: “number”\n}\nIf any field is not found, return an empty string or 0. Output must be valid JSON with no additional commentary.”\n\nUSER:\n“Here is the text of the invoice:\n[PASTE INVOICE TEXT HERE]\nPlease provide the parsed JSON.”\n\nThis structured approach (especially leveraging function calling, if you can) should greatly reduce unwanted text and help ChatGPT stick to returning just the data you need. If you still see incorrect or extraneous fields, double-check the data you’re feeding in (OCR artifacts, fuzzy text, etc.) and reinforce the instructions about how to handle missing or uncertain data.",

It sounds like you're trying to extract specific data from PDF invoices using OpenAI's API and ChatGPT, but you're encountering some issues with the output.\n\nA few thoughts and suggestions:\n\n1. **API vs. ChatGPT Web**: The OpenAI API and the ChatGPT web interface may have different capabilities and limitations. The API may provide more control and customization options, while the web interface may have a more user-friendly interface. It's worth exploring both options to see which one better suits your needs.\n\n2. **Data Extraction Accuracy**: Extracting data from unstructured documents like PDF invoices can be a challenging task, and the accuracy of the extracted data may vary depending on the quality and formatting of the invoices. You may need to experiment with different approaches and techniques to improve the accuracy of the data extraction.\n\n3. **Customizing the Output**: If the default JSON output from the API or ChatGPT doesn't match your requirements, you may need to provide more specific instructions or prompts to get the desired output format. For example, you could try including a sample JSON structure in your request to guide the output.\n\n4. **Handling Variations in Invoice Formats**: Invoices can have different layouts, formats, and information included, so you may need to build in some flexibility or preprocessing steps to handle these variations.\n\n5. **Validation and Error Handling**: It's important to have robust validation and error handling in your process to ensure that the extracted data is accurate and reliable. This may involve cross-checking the extracted data against other sources or implementing additional data validation checks.\n\nWithout more details about the specific issues you're encountering, it's difficult to provide more concrete suggestions. However, I'd recommend exploring the documentation and examples provided by OpenAI, as well as potentially reaching out to their support team if you're still having trouble. Additionally, you may find it helpful to research and experiment with other PDF data extraction tools or services to see if they can better meet your needs.",

Here are some solutions to improve accuracy:\n\n## 1. **Improve Your Prompt Structure**\n```python\nprompt = \"\"\"\nExtract ONLY the following information from the invoice. \nIf any field is not found, return null for that field.\nDo not infer or guess any values.\n\nReturn as JSON with these exact keys:\n- invoice_number: string or null\n- cif: string or null\n- total: number or null\n- date: string (YYYY-MM-DD) or null\n- vat: number or null\n- vat_amount: number or null\n\nImportant: Only extract data that is explicitly written in the document.\n\"\"\"\n```\n\n## 2. **Use Structured Output (Function Calling)**\n```python\nfunctions = [{\n    \"name\": \"extract_invoice_data\",\n    \"parameters\": {\n        \"type\": \"object\",\n        \"properties\": {\n            \"invoice_number\": {\"type\": [\"string\", \"null\"]},\n            \"cif\": {\"type\": [\"string\", \"null\"]},\n            \"total\": {\"type\": [\"number\", \"null\"]},\n            \"date\": {\"type\": [\"string\", \"null\"]},\n            \"vat\": {\"type\": [\"number\", \"null\"]}\n        },\n        \"required\": []\n    }\n}]\n```\n\n## 3. **Pre-process PDFs**\n- Convert PDF to text using OCR tools (PyPDF2, pdfplumber, or Tesseract)\n- Send the extracted text instead of the PDF directly\n- This gives you more control over what data is sent\n\n## 4. **Validation Layer**\nAdd a validation step to check extracted data:\n```python\ndef validate_extraction(extracted_data, original_text):\n    # Check if extracted values actually exist in the source text\n    for key, value in extracted_data.items():\n        if value and str(value) not in original_text:\n            extracted_data[key] = None\n    return extracted_data\n```\n\n## 5. **Use GPT-4 Vision for Better Accuracy**\nIf using the API, GPT-4 Vision tends to be more accurate with document extraction than text-based models.\n\nWould you like me to provide a complete example implementation?",

Specifically, you’re seeing responses that don’t meet your requirements—perhaps they’re incomplete, unstructured, or contain extra information.\n\nLet me address some common issues and offer suggestions for improving your results:\n\nCommon Problems & Solutions\n\n1. Model Responds with Explanations or Non-JSON Content  \nSolution:  \nExplicitly instruct the model to \"respond ONLY with valid JSON\" and not to include any explanations or extra text. Example prompt:  \nExtract the following fields from this PDF invoice: invoice_number, CIF, total, date, VAT. Respond ONLY with a JSON object with these keys, and do not include any extra text or explanations.\n\n2. Incorrect or Missing Fields  \nSolution:  \nList the exact keys you want in your prompt. For example:  \nReturn a JSON object with these fields:  \n{\n  \"invoice_number\": \"\",\n  \"CIF\": \"\",\n  \"total\": \"\",\n  \"date\": \"\",\n  \"VAT\": \"\"\n}\n\n3. Data Extraction Fails or Returns Garbage  \nSolution:  \nPDFs can be complex, especially if they contain images or irregular layouts. If using the API, ensure you’re sending the extracted text, not the raw PDF. Use a reliable PDF-to-text converter (like pdfplumber or PyPDF2 in Python) before sending content to GPT.\n\n4. Model Hallucinates or Fills Missing Data  \nSolution:  \nAdd instructions such as:  \nIf a field is missing or not found, use null. Do NOT guess or fabricate data.\n\n5. Prompt Example (for API):  \nHere is the text of an invoice:\n[Paste extracted invoice text here]\n\nPlease extract the following fields and return ONLY a JSON object with the exact structure below. If a value is missing, use null.\n{\n  \"invoice_number\": \"\",\n  \"CIF\": \"\",\n  \"total\": \"\",\n  \"date\": \"\",\n  \"VAT\": \"\"\n}\n\nDo not include any extra text or explanations.\n\nExtra Tips:\n\n- If you’re using the ChatGPT web interface and uploading a PDF, remember its extraction capabilities may be limited by the PDF’s formatting.\n- For best results, use the OpenAI API with pre-extracted text (not the PDF itself).\n- If you frequently process invoices, consider fine-tuning a model or using OpenAI's function calling to enforce stricter responses.\n\nIf you share a sample prompt and the JSON output you’re getting (versus what you want), I can help you refine your instructions further!",

          "response": "Below are a few techniques you can use to encourage ChatGPT (or the OpenAI API) to return strictly JSON data without extra explanatory text. The key idea is to use role-based messages (system and user prompts), or very explicit user instructions, that reinforce the format requirement.\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n1) Provide a “system” instruction (ChatGPT / API usage)\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nIn a ChatGPT conversation (web app), you can prepend a system message. In the OpenAI API (ChatCompletion endpoint), you include a message with role=system. For example:\n\nSystem message:\n\"You are an assistant that extracts specific data fields from invoices. Always respond with valid JSON, and nothing else. Do not include any extra explanations or disclaimers. If a value is missing, set it to null.\"\n\nNot all fields are guaranteed to be present every time, but this system message tells the model that when you ask for JSON, it should comply strictly.\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n2) In your user message, spell out the exact JSON keys required\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nAfter giving the system instruction, be explicit in your user-level request. For example:\n\nUser message:\n\"\"\"\nBelow is the text from a PDF invoice. Extract the following fields and output them as a valid JSON object, with no additional text or formatting beyond the JSON itself:\n\n- invoice_number\n- CIF\n- total\n- date\n- VAT\n\nIf a field is missing, set it to null.\n\nINVOICE TEXT HERE...\n\"\"\"\n\nYou can further reinforce:\n\"Do not include any explanations, bullet points, or disclaimers. Only return the JSON.\"\n\n──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n3) Prompt example for a minimal JSON-only response\n──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nHere’s a complete example prompt flow that you might use in the OpenAI ChatCompletion API:\n\n[\n  {\n    \"role\": \"system\",\n    \"content\": \"You are a JSON extraction assistant. You identify invoice metadata and nothing else.\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"Extract the following fields in JSON format only, with the keys [\\\"invoice_number\\\", \\\"CIF\\\", \\\"total\\\", \\\"date\\\", \\\"VAT\\\"]. Do not provide comments or markdown. Return only JSON. Example:\\n{\\n  \\\"invoice_number\\\": \\\"\\\",\\n  \\\"CIF\\\": \\\"\\\",\\n  \\\"total\\\": \\\"\\\",\\n  \\\"date\\\": \\\"\\\",\\n  \\\"VAT\\\": \\\"\\\"\\n}\\n\\nHere is the invoice text to parse:\\n[PASTE INVOICE TEXT HERE]\"\n  }\n]\n\nThat way, the model is strongly guided to respond with the desired JSON.\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────\n4) If extraneous text still appears\n────────────────────────────────────────────\n• Double-check that your system and user messages do not invite explanation.  \n• Emphasize “No extra text or disclaimers” in both system and user messages.  \n• Try adding a final instruction, e.g., “If you do not find a valid value for a field, output null. Do not include any justification or extra text.”  \n• If you are using the ChatGPT web interface, you can repeatedly refine your system (or first user) message if ChatGPT attempts to add commentary.\n\n──────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n5) Consider streaming or post-processing (API only)\n──────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nIn your code, if you are using the OpenAI API, you can:  \n• Use the “streaming” option and parse tokens as they arrive, ignoring anything outside of JSON.  \n• Or parse the final text with a JSON validator. If extra text is present, you can manually extract the JSON substring.  \n\nHowever, the best approach is to refine the prompt so that the JSON structure is all you receive.\n\n────────────────────────────────────────\n6) Summary\n────────────────────────────────────────\n• Provide a clear system prompt that states “Only output JSON. No extra text.”  \n• Give an explicit user prompt specifying the exact JSON format (keys, structure) and clarifying that missing data should be null.  \n• If necessary, implement a parsing layer (especially in code) that discards non-JSON text.  \n• Re-iterate these instructions if ChatGPT provides extraneous text.  \n\nUsing these steps should dramatically reduce or eliminate non-JSON content in the response, letting you reliably parse invoice data from the output.",

          "response": "It sounds like ChatGPT is returning additional text or formatting when you only want JSON. Here are a few strategies to help you get a “pure” JSON output from your PDF invoice data extraction:\n\n1. Clear and explicit instructions:  \n • In your prompt (or system message), state clearly that the output must be valid JSON with no extra commentary, markdown formatting, or additional text.  \n • For example: “Extract the following data from the attached PDF invoice and return only a JSON object in your response. Do not include any extra explanation, commentary, or markdown formatting. The JSON keys should be: invoice_number, CIF, total, invoice_date, due_date, VAT, etc.”\n\n2. Use a schema or template in your prompt:  \n • To enforce structure, describe the exact JSON schema you expect. For example:  \n  {\n   \"invoice_number\": \"<string>\",\n   \"CIF\": \"<string>\",\n   \"total\": \"<number>\",\n   \"invoice_date\": \"<string: YYYY-MM-DD>\",\n   \"due_date\": \"<string: YYYY-MM-DD>\",\n   \"VAT\": \"<number>\"\n  }  \n • This sets a clear expectation for the output.\n\n3. Avoid triggers for extra text:  \n • Sometimes, if you’re using a “chatty” prompt (e.g., starting with a greeting or a conversational tone), ChatGPT might feel inclined to add context or explanations.  \n • Keeping the prompt strictly technical can help minimize that behavior.\n\n4. Use a post-processing step:  \n • If extra text still appears, consider writing a simple script that identifies and extracts the JSON from the output. For example, you can use JSON parsing libraries in your programming language to detect and parse the first valid JSON object in the response.  \n • This is a useful fallback if the model occasionally includes extraneous content.\n\n5. Consider the environment differences:  \n • When working via the API vs. the ChatGPT web interface, there might be slight differences in output formatting. Ensure that your API call (or prompt parameters) reinforces the need for a JSON-only output.\n • For instance, in the API call, you can set temperature and max tokens in ways that steer the output toward a more deterministic format.\n\nBy combining these strategies—especially providing a very explicit prompt and, if necessary, filtering the output—you should be able to get consistent, JSON-only responses from your invoice extractions.\n\nIf you continue to see issues or extra output, consider sharing a sanitized version of your prompt (and, if possible, a sample output) so that further fine-tuning can be suggested.",

          "response": "t was not explicitly requested, or it deviates from the structured JSON format you've specified.\n\nTo ensure accurate extraction and structured JSON output, consider the following best practices:\n\n### 1. **Clearly Define the JSON Schema:**\nAlways explicitly outline the JSON keys you need. For instance:\n```json\n{\n  \"invoice_number\": \"\",\n  \"CIF\": \"\",\n  \"invoice_date\": \"\",\n  \"due_date\": \"\",\n  \"subtotal\": \"\",\n  \"VAT_amount\": \"\",\n  \"total\": \"\",\n  \"supplier_name\": \"\",\n  \"supplier_address\": \"\"\n}\n```\n\n### 2. **Explicit Instructions:**\nIn your prompt, clearly specify that:\n- You require only a JSON response.\n- You do not want any additional commentary, explanations, or data not explicitly requested.\n- The assistant must return empty values (`\"\"`) if information is not available clearly.\n\nFor example:\n> \"Extract only the following fields from this invoice PDF: invoice number, CIF, invoice date, due date, subtotal, VAT amount, total, supplier name, and supplier address. Return the result strictly in JSON format, use empty strings if data is unavailable. Do not add any data or explanations outside the JSON.\"\n\n### 3. **Structured Prompt Template:**\nUse a consistent prompt template for invoice data extraction:\n```\nExtract from the invoice the following fields only:\n- invoice_number\n- CIF\n- invoice_date\n- due_date\n- subtotal\n- VAT_amount\n- total\n- supplier_name\n- supplier_address\n\nRespond strictly in JSON format without any additional text. If a field is missing, return an empty string.\n```\n\n### 4. **Limit Contextual Ambiguity:**\nAvoid vague instructions or overly general requests to minimize the risk of unsolicited information. If ChatGPT returns additional or unrelated data, reinforce the clarity and specificity of your instructions.\n\n### Example of a Good Prompt:\n> \"Extract ONLY these fields from the PDF invoice provided: invoice_number, CIF, invoice_date, due_date, subtotal, VAT_amount, total, supplier_name, supplier_address. Respond strictly in JSON format. DO NOT include any additional information or explanations. If any data is unavailable, provide an empty string.\"\n\nBy using these guidelines, ChatGPT's responses will remain structured, consistent, and limited to the exact information you requested.",

Improve Your Prompt Structure\n\n```json\n{\n  \"role\": \"system\",\n  \"content\": \"You are a precise data extraction assistant. Extract ONLY the information that is clearly visible in the document. If a field is not found, use null. Do not infer or calculate values.\"\n}\n```\n\n```json\n{\n  \"role\": \"user\", \n  \"content\": \"Extract the following data from this invoice and return ONLY valid JSON with these exact keys. If any field is not clearly visible, use null:\\n\\n{\\n  \\\"invoice_number\\\": null,\\n  \\\"cif\\\": null,\\n  \\\"total_amount\\\": null,\\n  \\\"invoice_date\\\": null,\\n  \\\"due_date\\\": null,\\n  \\\"vat_amount\\\": null,\\n  \\\"subtotal\\\": null\\n}\\n\\nIMPORTANT: Return only the JSON object, no additional text.\"\n}\n```\n\n## 2. Add Validation Instructions\n\n```\n\"Before extracting, carefully read the entire document. Only extract data that matches these patterns:\n- Invoice number: Usually labeled as 'Invoice #', 'Invoice No.', 'Factura', etc.\n- CIF: Tax identification number, may be labeled as 'CIF', 'NIF', 'Tax ID'\n- Dates: Must be in recognizable date format (DD/MM/YYYY, MM/DD/YYYY, etc.)\n- Amounts: Must be clearly labeled as totals, VAT, subtotals with currency symbols\"\n```\n\n## 3. Handle PDF Quality Issues\n\n- Ensure PDFs are high quality and text-searchable\n- Consider using OCR preprocessing if PDFs are image-based\n- Test with different PDF formats to identify problematic types\n\n## 4. Implement Response Validation\n\n```python\nimport json\nimport re\n\ndef validate_extracted_data(response_text):\n    try:\n        # Extract JSON from response\n        json_match = re.search(r'\\{.*\\}', response_text, re.DOTALL)\n        if not json_match:\n            return None\n            \n        data = json.loads(json_match.group())\n        \n        # Validate required fields exist\n        required_fields = ['invoice_number', 'cif', 'total_amount', 'invoice_date']\n        for field in required_fields:\n            if field not in data:\n                data[field] = None\n                \n        return data\n    except json.JSONDecodeError:\n        return None\n```\n\n## 5. Use Structured Output (if using newer API versions)\n\n```python\nresponse = client.chat.completions.create(\n    model=\"gpt-4-vision-preview\",\n    messages=[...],\n    response_format={\"type\": \"json_object\"}\n)\n```\n\nCould you share what specific type of incorrect data you're getting?

If using ChatGPT web:\n\n- Clearly specify: \n  Please extract the following fields from this invoice as JSON: [your fields]. ONLY return the JSON object. Do not add any explanation, markdown, or comments.\n\n- Example prompt:\n  Extract the following fields from this PDF invoice as a JSON object: invoice_number, CIF, total, date, VAT. Only output the JSON.\n\n2. If using OpenAI API (function calling or regular completions):\n\n- Use the function calling feature (if using GPT-4 or GPT-3.5-turbo-0613+).\n- Define a function schema for the expected fields. The model will return structured JSON.\n\nExample function call schema:\n```json\n{\n  \"name\": \"extract_invoice_data\",\n  \"description\": \"Extracts invoice data from the text of a PDF invoice.\",\n  \"parameters\": {\n    \"type\": \"object\",\n    \"properties\": {\n      \"invoice_number\": { \"type\": \"string\" },\n      \"CIF\": { \"type\": \"string\" },\n      \"total\": { \"type\": \"string\" },\n      \"date\": { \"type\": \"string\" },\n      \"VAT\": { \"type\": \"string\" }\n    },\n    \"required\": [\"invoice_number\", \"CIF\", \"total\", \"date\", \"VAT\"]\n  }\n}\n```\n\nWhen you send the invoice text and ask the model to extract the data via the function call, the response will be structured JSON.\n\n3. If you get extra text along with your JSON (especially in ChatGPT web):\n\n- Try adding \"STRICTLY output only the JSON, no explanations, no markdown, no comments\" to your prompt.\n- If markdown formatting (```json ... ```) is added, you can strip it programmatically.\n\nExample in JavaScript:\n```javascript\nfunction extractJsonFromResponse(response) {\n    const match = response.match(/\\{[\\s\\S]*\\}/);\n    if (match) {\n        return JSON.parse(match[0]);\n    }\n    throw new Error(\"No JSON found in response\");\n}\n```\n\nSummary:\n\n- Use function calling in the API for strict JSON.\n- In ChatGPT, be very explicit in your prompt.\n- Programmatically extract JSON if the output contains extra text.\n\nIf you share the exact response you’re getting, I can help you fine-tune your prompt or code further!",

          "response": "Below is a general outline you can follow to extract structured JSON data from PDF invoices using OpenAI’s API. There are two main pieces to the process:\n\n1) Converting the PDF invoice into text.  \n2) Sending that text (or key excerpts from it) to the OpenAI API with a carefully crafted prompt to get well-formatted JSON.\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n1) Extract the text from the PDF\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nSince ChatGPT lacks a built-in method to directly parse PDFs, the usual approach is:\n• Use a PDF-to-text library in your preferred language (for example, pdfminer, PyPDF2, or similar).  \n• Read only the essential parts of the PDF to reduce token usage: you might split the text by pages or sections if the invoice is large.  \n\nExample (Node.js using pdf-parse):\n\nconst pdf = require(\"pdf-parse\");\nconst fs = require(\"fs\");\n\nasync function extractPdfText(filePath) {\n  const dataBuffer = fs.readFileSync(filePath);\n  const pdfData = await pdf(dataBuffer);\n  return pdfData.text; // The extracted text\n}\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n2) Send the extracted text to the OpenAI API with a “JSON-only” prompt\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nYou want the model to reliably output JSON without unwanted extra text. A prompt strategy might look like this:\n\n• Use a system or user prompt (depending on your integration) that strictly instructs ChatGPT to return JSON and only JSON.  \n• Provide an exact JSON schema or example as part of the instructions.  \n• Ask explicitly for each field (invoice_number, CIF, total, etc.) and indicate in the instructions that if some fields cannot be found, they should be output as null or an empty string.  \n• Make sure to keep your prompt short and consistent, as overly lengthy instructions can confuse the model.  \n\nExample prompt:\n\nsystem: |\n  You are a helpful assistant that extracts structured JSON invoices from text. \n  When given text from a PDF invoice, return only valid JSON. \n  Use the following format, and do not include any additional commentary:\n\n  {\n    \"invoice_number\": \"\",\n    \"CIF\": \"\",\n    \"total\": \"\",\n    \"date\": \"\",\n    \"VAT\": \"\",\n    \"customer_name\": \"\",\n    \"items\": []\n  }\n\n  If a field does not exist, return an empty string or null.\n\nuser: |\n  Here is the text extracted from the PDF invoice:\n  \"\"\"\n  [PASTE THE EXTRACTED TEXT HERE]\n  \"\"\"\n  Please extract and return only valid JSON as instructed.  \n\nIf you are using the ChatGPT web interface, you can provide these instructions in your prompt. If you are calling the OpenAI API programmatically, you would include the system message in the messages array, then your user message with the actual PDF text:\n\nconst { Configuration, OpenAIApi } = require(\"openai\");\n\nconst configuration = new Configuration({\n  apiKey: process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY\n});\nconst openai = new OpenAIApi(configuration);\n\nasync function extractInvoiceData(extractedText) {\n  const messages = [\n    {\n      role: \"system\",\n      content: `\n        You are a helpful assistant that extracts structured JSON invoices from text. \n        When given text from a PDF invoice, return only valid JSON. Use the following format:\n        {\n          \"invoice_number\": \"\",\n          \"CIF\": \"\",\n          \"total\": \"\",\n          \"date\": \"\",\n          \"VAT\": \"\",\n          \"customer_name\": \"\",\n          \"items\": []\n        }\n        If a field doesn't exist, return empty or null.

GPT-4 is generally better at following instructions precisely.\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n4) Optional: Use Function Calling (beta feature)\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nOpenAI’s ChatCompletion API (for GPT-3.5 and GPT-4) supports a feature called “function calling.” You can define a function schema (like a structured set of arguments in JSON), instruct the model to call that function with the extracted data, and parse the function call in the response. This is more reliable than trying to parse arbitrary text.  \nExample definition (high-level idea):\n\nconst functionDefinition = {\n  name: \"storeInvoiceData\",\n  description: \"Store extracted invoice information in the required format\",\n  parameters: {\n    type: \"object\",\n    properties: {\n      invoice_number: { type: \"string\" },\n      CIF: { type: \"string\" },\n      total: { type: \"string\" },\n      date: { type: \"string\" },\n      VAT: { type: \"string\" },\n      customer_name: { type: \"string\" },\n      items: {\n        type: \"array\",\n        items: {\n          type: \"object\",\n          properties: {\n            description: { type: \"string\" },\n            quantity: { type: \"string\" },\n            price: { type: \"string\" }\n          }\n        }\n      }\n    },\n    required: [\"invoice_number\", \"CIF\", \"total\", \"date\"]\n  }\n};\n\n// Then in createChatCompletion, you pass the function definition:\nconst response = await openai.createChatCompletion({\n  model: \"gpt-4-0613\",\n  messages: [ ... ],\n  functions: [functionDefinition],\n  function_call: \"auto\"\n});\n\nOnce the model calls the function, the JSON will be returned in a structured form under the message.function_call.arguments property. This approach significantly reduces the risk of invalid JSON or extraneous text.\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nSummary\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n1. Convert your PDF invoice to text using a PDF-to-text library.  \n2. Provide that text to the OpenAI API (or ChatGPT interface) with explicit instructions to return valid JSON only.  \n3. Strictly define your desired JSON schema and ask the model to leave fields empty or null if missing.  \n4. (Optional) Use the new OpenAI “function calling” feature to reliably enforce JSON structure in the response.  \n\nWith these steps, you should be able to automate extracting JSON data from PDF invoices using OpenAI’s API or via ChatGPT directly.",

          "response": "Below is an example of how you might implement a function (in Node.js) that reads a PDF invoice, extracts text from it, and then applies regular expressions (or other parsing logic) to retrieve specific fields (such as invoice number, CIF, total, dates, VAT, etc.) and finally returns a JSON object containing just those keys. (Note that in a production scenario you might want more robust error‐handling and text parsing than the simple regex shown here.)\n\n────────────────────────────\nExample Code (using pdf-parse):\n\n// First, install the pdf-parse package:\n//   npm install pdf-parse\n\nconst fs = require('fs');\nconst pdfParse = require('pdf-parse');\n\nfunction processRequest(pdfBuffer) {\n  // Return a promise that resolves with the extracted JSON data\n  return pdfParse(pdfBuffer)\n    .then(data => {\n      // data.text holds the full text content of the PDF file.\n      const text = data.text;\n\n      // Use regular expressions (or more advanced parsing techniques)\n      // to extract the desired fields.\n      // (These regexes are examples and may need adjustments for your invoice format.)\n\n      // Example regex patterns:\n      const invoiceNumberPattern = /Invoice Number\\s*:\\s*([\\w\\-]+)/i;\n      const cifPattern = /CIF\\s*:\\s*([\\w\\d]+)/i;\n      const totalPattern = /Total\\s*:\\s*\\$?([\\d,]+\\.\\d{2})/i;\n      const vatPattern = /VAT\\s*:\\s*([\\d,]+\\.\\d{2})/i;\n      const datePattern = /Date\\s*:\\s*([\\d\\/\\-]+)/i;\n\n      // Extracting the data\n      const invoiceNumberMatch = text.match(invoiceNumberPattern);\n      const cifMatch = text.match(cifPattern);\n      const totalMatch = text.match(totalPattern);\n      const vatMatch = text.match(vatPattern);\n      const dateMatch = text.match(datePattern);\n\n      // Build up the result JSON object with the keys you need.\n      const result = {\n        invoiceNumber: invoiceNumberMatch ? invoiceNumberMatch[1] : null,\n        CIF: cifMatch ? cifMatch[1] : null,\n        total: totalMatch ? totalMatch[1] : null,\n        date: dateMatch ? dateMatch[1] : null,\n        VAT: vatMatch ? vatMatch[1] : null\n      };\n\n      return result;\n    })\n    .catch(err => {\n      console.error('Error processing PDF:', err);\n      throw err;\n    });\n}\n\n// Example usage:\n// Read a sample PDF invoice from disk\nfs.readFile('sample-invoice.pdf', (err, pdfBuffer) => {\n  if (err) {\n    return console.error('Error reading the PDF file:', err);\n  }\n  processRequest(pdfBuffer)\n    .then(jsonData => {\n      console.log('Extracted JSON data:', jsonData);\n    })\n    .catch(err => {\n      console.error('Error:', err);\n    });\n});\n\n────────────────────────────\nExplanation:\n\n1. We load the PDF file as a Buffer (using fs.readFile) and pass that Buffer to the processRequest function.\n2. The processRequest function uses pdf-parse to extract the text from the PDF.\n3. Once the text is available, we apply regular expressions to search for specific patterns. For instance, the regex /Invoice Number\\s*:\\s*([\\w\\-]+)/i attempts to capture the invoice number given a label “Invoice Number : …”\n4. Finally, we build and return a JSON object limited to the keys we want (invoiceNumber, CIF, total, date, VAT).\n\nAdjust the regular expressions or adopt a more intelligent parsing strategy (for example, using a dedicated NLP tool) if your PDF invoice layouts vary.\n\n────────────────────────────\nNotes Regarding ChatGPT’s Extraction Behavior:\n\nIt sounds like you mentioned that when you ask ChatGPT to extract data from a real PDF invoice, the JSON output sometimes includes additional data. If you intend to build your own extraction tool (instead of prompting ChatGPT to act as the extractor), you will need to control the parsing algorithm precisely—something that the above code attempts by using explicit regex patterns and returning only the keys of interest.\n\nIf you are still interested in using the OpenAI API (or ChatGPT web) for extraction, you might consider providing a more tightly constrained prompt and possibly post-processing the output to strip out any unwanted extraneous fields.\n\nI hope this provides a useful starting point for your implementation!

However, you're encountering issues where the response contains unwanted data or doesn't strictly adhere to the requested JSON format with specified keys.\n\n---\n\n### Recommended Solution and Example Implementation:\n\nThe most effective way to reliably extract structured data from invoices using OpenAI's API is to clearly define your prompt and enforce a structured JSON format. Below is an example implementation in JavaScript (Node.js) using OpenAI's API that solves this issue:\n\n### Steps for best results:\n\n1. **Clearly define the JSON schema** you expect.\n2. **Use structured prompting** to strictly enforce JSON output.\n3. **Optionally, use a \"system\" message** to instruct the model explicitly.\n4. **Validate and parse the results** after the response is received.\n\nHere's a complete example implementation:\n\n```javascript\nconst { OpenAI } = require(\"openai\");\nconst fs = require(\"fs\");\n\n// Initialize OpenAI client\nconst openai = new OpenAI({\n    apiKey: process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY,\n});\n\n// Example function to process your PDF invoice\nasync function extractInvoiceData(pdfTextContent) {\n    const prompt = `\nYou are an assistant that extracts structured invoice information from text. \nGiven the provided invoice text, return ONLY a JSON object with the following keys:\n{\n  \"invoice_number\": \"string\",\n  \"CIF\": \"string\",\n  \"invoice_date\": \"YYYY-MM-DD\",\n  \"due_date\": \"YYYY-MM-DD\",\n  \"VAT\": \"number\",\n  \"total\": \"number\",\n  \"currency\": \"string\"\n}\n\nIf any information is missing or unclear, set its value to null.\n\nInvoice Text:\n\"\"\"${pdfTextContent}\"\"\"\n\nJSON Response:\n`;\n\n    const completion = await openai.chat.completions.create({\n        model: \"gpt-3.5-turbo\", // or use \"gpt-4\" if available\n        messages: [\n            { role: \"system\", content: \"Extract structured JSON data from invoices according to the provided format.

Identify the key information you need to extract, such as invoice number, CIF, total, dates, VAT, etc. This will help you understand the layout and placement of the data within the PDF.\n\n2. **Choose an Appropriate PDF Extraction Library**: There are several libraries available for extracting data from PDF files, such as PyPDF2, pdfplumber, or tabula-py (for Python). These libraries can help you parse the PDF structure and extract the specific data you need.\n\n3. **Implement the PDF Extraction Logic**: Use the chosen PDF extraction library to write a function that can process a PDF invoice and return the desired data in a JSON format. This function should handle various edge cases, such as different PDF layouts, missing data, or formatting inconsistencies.\n\nHere's an example implementation using the pdfplumber library in Python:\n\n```python\nimport pdfplumber\n\ndef extract_invoice_data(pdf_file):\n    with pdfplumber.open(pdf_file) as pdf:\n        # Assuming the invoice data is on the first page\n        page = pdf.pages[0]\n\n        # Extract the invoice number\n        invoice_number = page.extract_text(bbox=(100, 100, 200, 120))\n\n        # Extract the CIF\n        cif = page.extract_text(bbox=(100, 150, 200, 170))\n\n        # Extract the total\n        total = page.extract_text(bbox=(400, 300, 500, 320))\n\n        # Extract the dates\n        issue_date = page.extract_text(bbox=(100, 200, 200, 220))\n        due_date = page.extract_text(bbox=(100, 220, 200, 240))\n\n        # Extract the VAT\n        vat = page.extract_text(bbox=(400, 350, 500, 370))\n\n        # Return the data as a JSON-like dictionary\n        return {\n            \"invoice_number\": invoice_number,\n            \"cif\": cif,\n            \"total\": total,\n            \"issue_date\": issue_date,\n            \"due_date\": due_date,\n            \"vat\": vat\n        }\n```\n\nThis is just a basic example, and you may need to adjust the bounding box coordinates (`bbox`) to match the layout of your specific PDF invoices. Additionally, you may need to perform additional data cleaning and validation to ensure the extracted data is accurate and complete.\n\n4. **Integrate the PDF Extraction Function with OpenAI's API**: Once you have the PDF extraction function working, you can integrate it with OpenAI's API to provide the desired JSON output.

Specifically, you request a JSON output with certain fields, but the response may contain data that is not correctly formatted or is inaccurate/incomplete.\n\nHere are some key points and troubleshooting steps to help you get more accurate JSON outputs from PDF invoices:\n\n1. Prompt Engineering:\n- Be Explicit: Specify exactly which fields you want (invoice number, CIF, total, dates, VAT, etc.).\n- JSON-Only: Add \"Output only valid JSON, do not include explanations or extra text.\"\n- Example: Provide a sample JSON in your prompt, e.g.:\nExtract the following fields from the invoice: invoice_number, cif, total, invoice_date, vat, etc. Output only JSON in this format:\n{\n  \"invoice_number\": \"\",\n  \"cif\": \"\",\n  \"total\": \"\",\n  \"invoice_date\": \"\",\n  \"vat\": \"\"\n}\n\n2. PDF Quality and Text Extraction:\n- Text Layer: If the PDF is a scan or contains images, the text may not extract cleanly. Try running OCR (Optical Character Recognition) on the PDF before sending it to the model.\n- PDF to Text: Use a robust PDF-to-text tool (like pdfplumber or PyPDF2 in Python) to extract text before submitting to ChatGPT. This minimizes confusion from formatting.\n\n3. Model Limitations:\n- Context Window: If the PDF is very large, the entire document may not fit into the model’s context window, leading to missing or incomplete data extraction.\n- Complex Layouts: Tables, columns, or unusual formatting can confuse the model. Consider preprocessing or breaking up the extraction task.\n\n4. Post-Processing:\n- Validate Output: After getting the JSON, use code to check for missing/incorrect values or to clean up the output.\n- Error Handling: Prepare for cases where the model outputs extra text or a malformed JSON (e.g., via try/except in Python).\n\n5. Common Error Messages:\n- If you get a specific error message (e.g., \"Could not parse JSON,\" \"Missing field,\" etc.), include the exact wording for more targeted help.\n\nExample Improved Prompt:\nPlease extract the following fields from this invoice: invoice_number, cif, total, invoice_date, vat. Output only a valid JSON object in the following format (no explanations or extra text):\n{\n  \"invoice_number\": \"\",\n  \"cif\": \"\",\n  \"total\": \"\",\n  \"invoice_date\": \"\",\n  \"vat\": \"\"\n}\n\nIf a field is missing, leave it as an empty string.\n\nIf you can share the exact error message or a sample of the output you’re getting, I can help further troubleshoot the issue!\n\nLet me know if you need help with code examples or further prompt refinement.",

          "response": "It sounds like you want ChatGPT (or the OpenAI API) to return strictly JSON-formatted information extracted from a PDF invoice, but you’re getting additional text or unrequested data in the response. Below are some suggestions to help ensure ChatGPT produces the clean JSON output you need:\n\n1) Preprocess (Extract Text Beforehand)\n   • ChatGPT does not directly process PDF files the same way it processes text. If you’re not already doing so, use a tool or library to extract the raw text from the PDF first (for example, PyPDF2, Tika, pdfplumber, or a similar library). \n   • Once you have the raw text, you can supply that text to ChatGPT or the OpenAI API in your prompt.\n\n2) Use Well-Defined Prompts and System/Role Instructions\n   • When you send a request to ChatGPT, include a system or user instruction (depending on your integration) that strictly tells ChatGPT how to format the response.  \n   • For example, use a system instruction like:  \n     \n     \"You are an assistant that extracts invoice data. Output only valid JSON with the following keys: invoice_number, invoice_date, company_cif, total_amount, vat_amount, etc. Do not include any additional explanation.\"\n   \n   • When you compose your user message, phrase it as:  \n     \n     \"Here is the extracted text from the PDF invoice: [Paste the invoice text here].  \n      Please extract the following fields as JSON:  \n      {  \n        'invoice_number': '',  \n        'invoice_date': '',  \n        'company_cif': '',  \n        'total_amount': '',  \n        'vat_amount': ''  \n      }  \n      Output only valid JSON.\"\n\n3) Check Your JSON Structure\n   • Make sure the JSON keys you want are spelled consistently with how you define them in your prompt.  \n   • If the invoice might have multiple totals, clarify whether you want “total_amount_incl_vat” or “subtotal_excl_vat,” etc.  \n   • By giving ChatGPT an exact template for desired JSON, you reduce the chance of extra text sneaking into the response.\n\n4) Use “Temperature” or “Top_p” Adjustments (OpenAI API)\n   • If you are using the OpenAI API directly, consider setting the temperature to 0.0 or a low value. This can reduce creativity and make the model more likely to follow instructions strictly.  \n   • Example:  \n     \n     openai.ChatCompletion.create(\n       model=\"gpt-3.5-turbo\",\n       temperature=0.0,\n       messages=[\n         {\"role\": \"system\", \"content\": \"You are an assistant that ...\"},\n         {\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"Extract ...\"}\n       ]\n     )\n\n5) Validate the Response in Code\n   • Once you receive the output, run it through a JSON parser in your code to confirm that it’s valid JSON.  \n   • If it’s not valid or if it contains extra text, you can retry, or you can use regex or post-processing scripts to clean it. But a properly-given prompt often avoids this extra step.\n\n6) Consider Function Calling (If Available)\n   • If you have access to function calling in the newer ChatGPT API, you can define a function signature that includes the exact parameters (invoice_number, invoice_date, etc.)  \n   • ChatGPT will output the result as JSON that directly matches your function signature, reducing the chance of extraneous output.  \n   • Example definition (simplified):  \n     \n     {\n       \"name\": \"parse_invoice\",\n       \"description\": \"Extract invoice data\",\n       \"parameters\": {\n         \"type\": \"object\",\n         \"properties\": {\n           \"invoice_number\": {\"type\": \"string\"},\n           \"invoice_date\": {\"type\": \"string\"},\n           \"company_cif\": {\"type\": \"string\"},\n           \"total_amount\": {\"type\": \"string\"},\n           \"vat_amount\": {\"type\": \"string\"}\n         },\n         \"required\": [...]\n       }\n     }\n   \n   • Then instruct the model: \"Read the invoice text. Call the function parse_invoice with the correct values.\"\n\n7) Double Check PDF Content vs. Prompt Fields\n   • Sometimes the invoice text itself might not contain specific fields (for instance, a missing VAT number). The model might attempt to ‘fill in’ data it believes should be there, which could lead to extra or incorrect data in the JSON.  \n   • Emphasize that if a field doesn’t exist, it should be output as null or an empty string.\n\n8) Provide a Minimal Example\n   • If you are testing, start with a small snippet (like a dummy invoice text) and a minimal set of keys to confirm that ChatGPT follows your formatting rules. Once you have the format working, move on to the actual invoice text.\n\nPutting It All Together (Sample Prompt):\n-----------------------------------------\nSYSTEM:  \n\"You are an assistant that extracts invoice data. Output only valid JSON with the following keys: invoice_number, invoice_date, company_cif, total_amount, vat_amount. Do not provide any additional text or explanation.\"\n  \nUSER:  \n\"Below is the text extracted from the invoice PDF:  \n[Paste extracted text here]  \n  \nPlease provide the invoice data in JSON form:  \n{  \n  'invoice_number': '',  \n  'invoice_date': '',  \n  'company_cif': '',  \n  'total_amount': '',  \n  'vat_amount': ''  \n}  \n\nOutput only valid JSON. No explanation.\"\n\nBy combining a strict prompt, a low temperature, and appropriate system instructions (or function calling), you should receive a clean JSON response without the extra data or commentary. If you still get unwanted text, try refining your instructions further; sometimes adding “Do not include any additional output” or “Do not include any narrative description” helps keep ChatGPT on track.",

There are a few things to consider and try:\n\n1. PDF-to-text conversion: ChatGPT (or the OpenAI API) doesn’t directly “read” PDFs. If you’re uploading a PDF file (for instance via a file upload in ChatGPT’s interface), ensure that you’re either preprocessing it (using OCR or a dedicated PDF-to-text library) or that you’re certain it’s converted to text. Otherwise, the model might misinterpret parts of the file.\n\n2. Prompt clarity: When you request only JSON output, be explicit in your prompt. For example, you might say:\n  \"Extract the following fields from the invoice and return only a valid JSON object with no additional text:\n  {\n    'invoice_number': '',\n    'CIF': '',\n    'total': '',\n    'date': '',\n    'VAT': ''\n  }\n  If a certain field is not present, set its value to null.\"\n\n3. Temperature and model behavior: Setting the temperature to 0 (if using the API) helps reduce creative additions. A deterministic mode will usually stick closer to your instructions without adding extra explanation.\n\n4. Formatting enforcement: If you’re receiving extra data, you can include strict instructions like “Your entire response must be valid JSON and nothing else.” In past interactions, if ChatGPT outputs additional commentary, you could reiterate by saying “Only provide the JSON output. Do not include any explanation or markdown formatting.”\n\n5. Using function calling (if available): OpenAI’s newer function calling feature allows you to define a schema for what data you expect. This may help enforce a strict JSON output.\n\n6. Real invoice complexity: Real invoices can include headers, footers, logos, or other formatting artifacts that might throw off the extraction process. You might need to clean or pre-process the text output from the PDF before sending it to ChatGPT for extraction.\n\nCould you clarify what you mean by “contains data tha”?

For best results, use the API for automation.\n- If ChatGPT returns extra text, try: “Respond ONLY with valid JSON. Do not include any explanations, comments, or text outside the JSON.”\n- Validate the output programmatically and, if necessary, re-prompt or apply post-processing to clean the response.\n\nIf you are frequently getting extra data or explanations, refine your prompt and consider using function calling (if using GPT-4 API) to enforce the structure.\n\nIf you share more details about your current process, prompt, or API usage, I can provide a more tailored solution!",

Understanding the Pseudocode\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n\nPROCEDURE HandleTask(task: \"Hello,I’m using OpenAI’s API (and ChatGPT web) …\")\nBEGIN\n    IF task.isValid() THEN\n        Process(task)\n    ELSE\n        Reject(task)\nEND PROCEDURE\n\n• You have a procedure named HandleTask.\n• It takes a parameter task, which appears to be a string containing details about using the OpenAI API to extract invoice data.\n• The procedure checks if task.isValid() (some validity check), and if so, calls Process(task); otherwise, it calls Reject(task).\n\nIn a real system, you would typically replace Process(task) and Reject(task) with functions (or methods) that implement your actual business logic (e.g., calling the OpenAI API, extracting data from a PDF, returning JSON, logging errors, etc.).\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n2. Best Practices for Extracting Data from PDF Invoices\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n\nWhile the procedure above is just a skeleton, here are some practical steps to consider when building a solution that uses OpenAI or ChatGPT to extract data from PDF invoices:\n\n1) Pre-Process the PDF (if possible)\n   • Use a library (like pdfplumber, PyPDF2, or Tesseract for scanned PDFs) to extract text from your PDF invoice.  \n   • Clean or structure the text before sending it to the OpenAI API—this reduces “hallucination” because ChatGPT sees the exact relevant text.\n\n2) Provide Specific, Structured Prompts\n   • When using ChatGPT to extract invoice data, your prompt should:\n       o Include only the relevant text from the invoice (not the entire PDF, if it contains irrelevant sections).  \n       o Explicitly instruct ChatGPT on the exact JSON structure you need, for example:\n\n         “Please parse the following invoice text. Return only the following fields in valid JSON format:\n          {\n            \"invoiceNumber\": \"\",\n            \"CIF\": \"\",\n            \"total\": \"\",\n            \"invoiceDate\": \"\",\n            \"dueDate\": \"\",\n            \"VAT\": \"\"\n            ...\n          }\n          Do not include any additional commentary or keys.”\n\n   • Reinforce these guidelines in the system or user messages when using the ChatGPT API to reduce undesired output.\n\n3) Use Temperature, Top_P (Optional)\n   • If you find ChatGPT making up data or providing too much text, try setting the temperature to 0 or a low value. \n   • This can reduce the “creative” aspect of the model and push it toward being more factual/concise.\n\n4) Validate the Returned JSON\n   • After ChatGPT responds, try to parse the JSON in your application.\n   • If it fails to parse or if any required keys are missing, you can prompt ChatGPT again or handle it with fallback logic.\n\n5) Consider a Two-Phase Approach (Manual + AI)\n   • If the invoice structure is somewhat consistent, you might first parse structured fields using rule-based or layout-based methods (e.g., extracting text positions).\n   • Then, let ChatGPT fill in gaps or interpret ambiguous parts. This can be more reliable than handing over an entire invoice to ChatGPT in one step.\n\n6) Monitor for Hallucinations\n   • ChatGPT can sometimes produce fields or values that are not actually present.\n   • Always cross-check the final result against the original text if reliability is paramount.\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n3. Example of a More Complete Workflow (Pseudocode)\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n\nFUNCTION ExtractInvoiceDataFromPDF(pdfFilePath: STRING): JSON\nBEGIN\n    // Step 1: Extract text from PDF\n    invoiceText ← ExtractTextFromPDF(pdfFilePath)\n\n    // Step 2: Create a structured prompt\n    prompt ← \"\"\"\n    You are an assistant trained to extract specific fields from invoices.\n    Below is the raw text of an invoice. Please extract the data and provide it\n    in valid JSON with the exact fields shown. Do not add extra text or keys.\n    Invoice text: \n    \\\"\\\"\\\"\"\"\" + invoiceText + \"\"\"\\\"\\\"\\\"\n\n    JSON Format (all fields must be present, even if empty):\n    {\n      \"invoiceNumber\": \"\",\n      \"CIF\": \"\",\n      \"total\": \"\",\n      \"invoiceDate\": \"\",\n      \"dueDate\": \"\",\n      \"VAT\": \"\"\n    }\n    \"\"\"\n\n    // Step 3: Call ChatGPT API\n    response ← OpenAIChatCompletion(\n        systemMessage = \"You are a helpful assistant.\",\n        userMessage   = prompt,\n        temperature   = 0\n    )\n\n    // Step 4: Validate/parse the JSON\n    invoiceData ← ParseJSON(response)\n\n    // Step 5: If parsing fails or if fields are missing, handle accordingly\n    IF invoiceData is invalid THEN\n        invoiceData ← { \"error\": \"Invalid or incomplete JSON\" }\n    END IF\n\n    RETURN invoiceData\nEND\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n4. Summary\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n\n• Your pseudocode indicates a simple structure for task handling: check validity, then either process or reject.  \n• In practical invoice processing, focus carefully on how you prompt ChatGPT to minimize extra text and hallucinated data.  \n• Employ a robust validation pipeline—check if the JSON is valid and if all required fields exist.  \n• Combining PDF parsing libraries with ChatGPT’s language understanding is often the best approach.\n\nI hope this clarifies how you might evolve your “HandleTask” procedure into a more complete solution that robustly extracts JSON data from PDFs using OpenAI or ChatGPT.

When it is valid, the task is processed (extraction takes place), and otherwise it is rejected.\n\n──────────────────────────────\nAdvice for Returning Strict JSON Output\n\nWhen using OpenAI’s API (or ChatGPT web) to extract data from invoices and to output only JSON with specific keys (like invoiceNumber, CIF, total, dates, VAT, etc.), you might notice that the response sometimes includes extra commentary or unexpected data. To help make sure you get a clean JSON response, consider the following strategies:\n\n1. Provide Explicit Instructions:\n   • Clearly state in your prompt that you want ONLY the JSON output.\n   • For example:\n     “Extract the following fields from the PDF invoice: invoiceNumber, CIF, total, dates, VAT. Respond only with a single JSON object containing exactly these keys and no extra text or commentary.”\n     \n2. Example-Based Prompting:\n   • Include an example of the expected JSON output inline with the instruction. This can help set the format expectation.\n   • For example:\n     “If the invoice number is ‘12345’, CIF is ‘A12345678’, total is 150.00, date is ‘2023-10-01’, and VAT is 21%, your output should be:\n     {\n         “invoiceNumber”: “12345”,\n         “CIF”: “A12345678”,\n         “total”: 150.00,\n         “date”: “2023-10-01”,\n         “VAT”: “21%”\n     }\n     Do not include anything else in your response.”\n\n3. Use System Instructions:\n   • When available (especially via the API), include system-level instructions that emphasize “ONE JSON object only – no additional text.”\n   • This sets the response style for the entire session.\n\n4. Set Low Temperature:\n   • In your API call, setting the temperature parameter to a low value (e.g. 0 or 0.2) can encourage deterministic responses and can help avoid extraneous content.\n\n5. Post-Processing:\n   • After receiving the response, validate that it is proper JSON and only contains the allowed keys.\n   • If using automatic pipelines, you can incorporate a JSON parser that verifies the output strictly adheres to your schema. If extra data is present, you can either trim it or flag it for manual review.\n\n──────────────────────────────\nSumming Up\n\nYour pseudocode for HandleTask is a way to ensure that a task is processed only if valid. In your actual application, the “Process(task)” function should fully incorporate the extraction prompt guidelines discussed above. This way, when you upload a real PDF invoice, ChatGPT is more likely to output exactly the JSON with only the keys you need.\n\nBy combining clear prompt instructions with procedural validation and optional post-processing, you can reduce the extra output and achieve a consistent JSON response.\n\nFeel free to ask if you need further details or if you’d like to see additional code examples!",

          "response": "Below is a sample technical specification that outlines how to fulfill Functional Requirement FR-3756 for extracting structured JSON data from PDF invoices using OpenAI’s API (or ChatGPT). It includes an overview of the requirement, the approach to parsing PDFs, how to enforce a JSON-only response, and the acceptance criteria.\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n1. OVERVIEW\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n• Functional Requirement ID: FR-3756  \n• Description:  \n  - The system must extract specific fields (e.g., invoice number, CIF, total, date, VAT) from PDFs containing invoices.  \n  - The output must strictly be valid JSON, without additional text or commentary.  \n  - The system must handle different invoice formats and potentially incomplete data.  \n\n• Primary Goal:  \n  - Automate invoice data extraction.  \n  - Provide consistently structured JSON outcomes.\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n2. USE CASES & SCOPE\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n• Use Case 1:  \n  - A user uploads a PDF invoice (manually via web form or via an API endpoint).  \n  - The system extracts relevant key-value pairs and returns them in JSON format.\n\n• Use Case 2:  \n  - A developer programmatically sends a PDF (converted to text, or as raw PDF if the pipeline supports it) to an OpenAI API endpoint.  \n  - The system retrieves the structured data and logs the transaction.\n\n• Out of Scope:  \n  - Complex table parsing.  \n  - OCR for low-resolution scans (possible future extension using Vision+LLM or third-party OCR libraries).\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n3. TECHNICAL APPROACH\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n\n3.1 PDF to Text Extraction\n--------------------------------------------------------\n• Rationale:  \n  - Large Language Models (LLMs) like ChatGPT work best with text input rather than raw binary PDFs.  \n  - Extract text from PDF invoices using a preferred library or service (e.g., pdfplumber, Apache Tika, PyMuPDF).  \n  - In case of image-based PDFs, use OCR (e.g., Tesseract) to convert images to text first.  \n\n• Proposed Steps:  \n  1. Receive the PDF file.  \n  2. If needed, perform OCR for image-based PDFs.  \n  3. Extract text from the PDF.  \n  4. Clean the extracted text (e.g., remove headers/footers, normalize spacing).  \n\n3.2 Prompting OpenAI / ChatGPT for JSON Extraction\n--------------------------------------------------------\n• Rationale:  \n  - LLMs can identify fields within text, but the prompt must instruct the LLM to output only a strict JSON format.  \n\n• Recommended Prompt Design:  \n  1. System/Developer Prompt (high priority):  \n     \"You are a data extraction system. You will receive invoice text. Your job is to extract the following fields and respond strictly in valid JSON with these keys:  \n     { \"invoice_number\": <string>, \"CIF\": <string>, \"total\": <string>, \"date\": <string>, \"VAT\": <string> }  \n     If a value is missing, use an empty string or null.\"  \n\n  2. User Prompt (invoice text):  \n     \"Extract the specified fields from the following invoice text:  \n      [Insert PDF extracted text here].  \n      Remember: only output valid JSON.\"\n\n3.3 Enforcing JSON Output\n--------------------------------------------------------\n• Use OpenAI Function Calling (if available):  \n  - Define a function schema within the OpenAI API that specifies the expected fields (invoice_number, CIF, total, date, VAT).  \n  - The LLM will respond according to that function signature.  \n\n• Fallback Approach (If not using Function Calling):  \n  - Post-process the LLM output to ensure it parses correctly as JSON.  \n  - If the output is not valid JSON, retry or log an error for human intervention.  \n\n3.4 Logging and Error Handling\n--------------------------------------------------------\n• Logging:  \n  - Log each invoice processing attempt with timestamps, user ID (if relevant), and partial extracted text or metadata.  \n  - Log the final JSON response from the LLM.  \n  - Store logs securely, respecting data privacy.  \n\n• Error Handling:  \n  - If OCR or text extraction fails, return an appropriate error code and message.  \n  - If the LLM fails to produce valid JSON after multiple attempts, log and store the response for manual review.  \n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n4. DATA MODEL (JSON FIELDS)\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nBelow is a sample JSON structure to be returned by the system:\n\n{\n  \"invoice_number\": \"INV001234\",\n  \"CIF\": \"A12345678\",\n  \"total\": \"999.99\",\n  \"date\": \"2023-09-12\",\n  \"VAT\": \"21%\"\n}\n\nNotes:\n• Fields may be empty strings or null if the invoice text does not contain the expected data.  \n• Additional fields can be appended as needed (e.g., \"supplier_name\", \"customer_name\", etc.).\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n5. NON-FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n• Performance:  \n  - Must respond within acceptable time (e.g., <10 seconds for typical, text-based PDF <5 pages).  \n\n• Security & Privacy:  \n  - Strictly handle invoice documents and extracted data in compliance with relevant privacy regulations (GDPR, etc.).  \n  - Secure API endpoints with authentication and HTTPS.\n\n• Scalability:  \n  - System should support concurrent requests from multiple users or services.\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n6. ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n1. System processes request:  \n   - A PDF is sent to the system.  \n   - The system successfully extracts text and sends the prompt to the LLM.\n\n2. Response generated:  \n   - The system receives a valid JSON response containing (at minimum) the five specified fields.  \n   - If the data cannot be found, the system still replies with valid JSON using empty or null fields.\n\n3. Logging enabled:  \n   - Each request and response is logged with timestamps and metadata.  \n   - Errors or invalid JSON responses are flagged accordingly.\n\n▶ Example Pass Criteria:\n• A PDF invoice is uploaded; the output from the system:  \n  {  \n    \"invoice_number\": \"INV-007\",  \n    \"CIF\": \"B98765432\",  \n    \"total\": \"1200.50\",  \n    \"date\": \"2023-08-30\",  \n    \"VAT\": \"21%\"  \n  }\n\n▶ Example Fail Criteria:\n• The LLM response includes additional commentary or is not parseable as JSON.  \n• Critical invoice fields are missing or nonsensical when they do appear in the source text.  \n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n7. IMPLEMENTATION CONSIDERATIONS\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n• Testing:  \n  - Use a library of real and synthetic invoices with different formats to validate the model’s performance.  \n  - Automated tests that parse the JSON and verify the presence of required keys.\n\n• Future Enhancements:  \n  - Integrate additional optional fields (e.g., “line_items”, “discount”, “currency”).  \n  - Improve extraction accuracy by fine-tuning or training specialized models on invoice data.  \n  - Explore function calling or advanced structured prompting to minimize JSON syntax errors.\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nEND OF TECHNICAL REQUIREMENT\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n\nThis specification provides a structured way to address the invoice-data-extraction challenge. By ensuring a consistent PDF-to-text pipeline, a carefully crafted prompt or function-calling method, and proper error handling, the system can reliably return the requested JSON fields while meeting the outlined acceptance criteria.",

PDF Processing:\n- Use a PDF parsing library like PyPDF2 or pdfminer to extract text from the uploaded PDF invoice.\n\n2. OpenAI API Integration:\n- Set up authentication to access the OpenAI API\n- Construct a prompt that specifies the exact JSON structure and keys you want extracted\n- Send the extracted PDF text along with the structured prompt to the API\n\n3. Response Handling:\n- Parse the JSON response from the OpenAI API\n- Implement error handling for malformed responses\n\n4. Logging:\n- Set up a logging framework (e.g. Python's built-in logging module)\n- Log key events: PDF upload, API request, API response, any errors\n\n5. Input Validation:\n- Validate the uploaded file is a valid PDF\n- Check that all required fields are present in the API response\n\n6. Output Formatting:\n- Ensure the final output matches the specified JSON structure exactly\n\nSample code structure:\n\n```python\nimport logging\nfrom pdf_parser import extract_text_from_pdf\nfrom openai_client import get_openai_response\n\nlogging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO)\n\ndef process_invoice(pdf_file):\n    logging.info(f\"Processing invoice: {pdf_file}\")\n    \n    # Extract text from PDF\n    pdf_text = extract_text_from_pdf(pdf_file)\n    \n    # Construct API prompt\n    prompt = \"Extract the following fields as JSON: invoice number, CIF, total, dates, VAT\"\n    \n    # Get response from OpenAI\n    try:\n        response = get_openai_response(prompt, pdf_text)\n        logging.info(\"Received response from OpenAI API\")\n    except Exception as e:\n        logging.error(f\"Error calling OpenAI API: {str(e)}\")\n        return None\n    \n    # Validate and format response\n    try:\n        formatted_response = validate_and_format_response(response)\n        logging.info(\"Response validated and formatted successfully\")\n        return formatted_response\n    except ValueError as e:\n        logging.error(f\"Error in response format: {str(e)}\")\n        return None\n\n# Additional helper functions would be implemented as needed\n```\n\nThis approach should meet the acceptance criteria by processing the request, generating a response, and enabling logging throughout the process.

When extracting data from PDFs (especially via copy-paste or OCR), the input may be incomplete, noisy, or formatted poorly, causing the model to \"fill in\" missing information or hallucinate plausible values, rather than strictly extracting what's present.\n- LLMs are not inherently deterministic extractors; they generate plausible outputs rather than guaranteed factually correct parses.\n\nSolutions/Workarounds:\n1. Use PDF-to-text extraction tools (e.g., pdfplumber, PyPDF2) to convert the PDF to clean, structured text before passing it to the LLM. This reduces the risk of missing or garbled data.\n2. Provide the LLM with a clear, minimal context (just the invoice text, no instructions or prior conversation) and a very strict prompt, e.g.:\n   ```\n   Extract the following fields as JSON: invoice_number, CIF, total, date, VAT.\n   Only include fields that are present in the text. Do not invent or hallucinate any values.\n   Here is the invoice text:\n   [PASTE CLEANED TEXT]\n   ```\n3. Use function calling (OpenAI API v4) or structured output parsers, which can help constrain the output format and reduce hallucination.\n4. For production-grade extraction, consider combining LLMs with regular expressions or rule-based post-processing to validate or cross-check the extracted fields.\n5. If possible, fine-tune a model or use tools like LayoutLM or document AI services that are specifically designed for document data extraction.\n\nReference:\n- OpenAI Community: Why does ChatGPT invent values when extracting from PDFs?\n- OpenAI Cookbook: Reliable data extraction from unstructured documents\n\nSummary:\nLLMs are not perfect extractors and may hallucinate data from PDFs. Clean input, strict prompts, and hybrid approaches (LLM + rules) yield the most reliable results.\n\nWould you like code examples or further details on implementation?",

          "response": "Below is a high-level outline of a search algorithm that uses relevance scoring to identify the “best match” from a knowledge database for the given query, under the assumption you have indexed your knowledge base for O(log n) retrieval.\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n1. PREPROCESSING AND INDEX CREATION\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n   1.1. Tokenization and Normalization\n       • Split the text (each knowledge base document) into distinct tokens \n         (e.g., words) by removing punctuation and splitting on whitespace.\n       • Convert all tokens to a consistent form (e.g., lowercase) to reduce\n         variation (e.g., “Hello” → “hello”).\n       • Perform stemming or lemmatization if appropriate. \n\n   1.2. Stop-word Removal (Optional)\n       • Remove common stop words (e.g., “the,” “and,” “a,” etc.) to reduce\n         noise in indexing, if desired or helpful for your domain.\n\n   1.3. Build an Inverted Index\n       • Create a mapping from each token → list of documents (or entries)\n         that contain the token.\n         Example structure (simplified):\n           {\n             \"invoice\": [docID1, docID2],\n             \"json\":    [docID2, docID5],\n             \"total\":   [docID3, docID5],\n             ...\n           }\n       • For each token, store positions or term frequency in each document.\n         This allows more fine-grained relevance calculations later.\n\n   1.4. Store Document Statistics\n       • Each document should have a unique identifier (docID).\n       • Maintain necessary statistics such as the length of each document \n         (in tokens), the frequency of each token, etc.\n       • Common approach: For each token t in document d, store:\n             tf(d, t) = frequency of t in d\n         And globally:\n             df(t) = how many documents contain t\n         These support TF–IDF or similar scoring.\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n2. SEARCH QUERY PROCESSING\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n   2.1. Query Tokenization and Normalization\n       • Break the user’s query into tokens using the same process applied\n         to documents (lowercase, remove punctuation, etc.).\n\n   2.2. Retrieve Candidate Documents via the Inverted Index\n       • For each query token q, fetch the list of documents that contain q.\n       • Take the union of all such lists. This collection is your candidate\n         document set for relevance scoring.\n\n       Complexity Note:\n       • If your inverted index is stored in a data structure like a B-tree \n         or a prefix tree, each token lookup (q → list of docIDs) can be done\n         in O(log n) time (depending on the implementation). \n       • Final candidate retrieval is then O(Q · log n), where Q is the number\n         of query tokens.\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n3. RELEVANCE SCORING\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n   3.1. Common Scoring Methods\n       • TF–IDF (Term Frequency – Inverse Document Frequency)\n       • BM25 (Okapi BM25)\n       • Cosine similarity over vector embeddings (if you go beyond keyword\n         search and use vector-based approaches)\n\n   Example (TF–IDF):\n       For each document d in the candidate set:\n         For each term t in query:\n           score(d) += (tf(d, t) * idf(t))\n         Where:\n           tf(d, t)  = term frequency of t in d\n           idf(t)    = log( N / df(t) )\n           N         = total number of documents\n           df(t)     = number of documents that contain t\n       • After summing over all terms in the query, the final score for\n         document d can be normalized by the document length (or other \n         normalization).\n\n   3.2. Select the Best Match\n       • Sort the candidate documents by score, descending.\n       • The top-ranked document (highest score) is considered the “best match.”\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n4. TERMINATION CRITERIA\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n   • Once you have the sorted list of candidate documents, you can stop \n     because you have found the highest-scoring (best match) document.\n   • If you only need the single best match, you can avoid fully sorting by\n     keeping track of a running max. This step is then O(k) where k is the \n     number of candidate documents.\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n5. OVERALL COMPLEXITY\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n   • The primary cost in searching is looking up each query token in the \n     inverted index. Each lookup can be O(log n) if a tree or B-tree data \n     structure is used (n = number of distinct tokens, or entries in the \n     index). \n   • Summarily, your final candidate set retrieval is O(Q · log n) + M, \n     where Q is the number of query tokens and M is the combined size of \n     candidate lists. Scoring each candidate can be done in O(M · Q) \n     (since you iterate over each term for each candidate).\n   • When you only need the top result, you can keep a running maximum \n     instead of sorting, giving you O(M) to find the best match from the \n     candidate set.\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n6. EXAMPLE WALK-THROUGH FOR THE GIVEN QUERY\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n   • Query: \n       \"Hello, I’m using OpenAI’s API (and ChatGPT web) to extract data \n        from PDF invoices, requesting only a JSON output with specific \n        keys, such as invoice number, CIF, total, dates, VAT, etc. Problem:\n        When I upload a real PDF invoice and ask ChatGPT to extract the data…\"\n\n   1) Normalize and tokenize:\n      [\"hello\", \"i’m\", \"using\", \"openai’s\", \"api\", \"and\", \"chatgpt\", \"web\", \n       \"to\", \"extract\", \"data\", \"from\", \"pdf\", \"invoices\", \"requesting\", \n       \"only\", \"a\", \"json\", \"output\", \"with\", \"specific\", \"keys\", \"such\", \n       \"as\", \"invoice\", \"number\", \"cif\", \"total\", \"dates\", \"vat\", \"etc\", \n       \"problem\", \"when\", \"i\", \"upload\", \"a\", \"real\", \"pdf\", \"invoice\", \n       \"and\", \"ask\", \"chatgpt\", \"to\", \"extract\", \"the\", \"data\"]\n\n   2) Use each token to fetch potential matching documents via the \n      inverted index. Suppose \"pdf\", \"invoice\", \"json\", \"extract\" are \n      rare tokens; they may strongly filter the candidate documents \n      because fewer will contain these words.\n\n   3) Compute a relevance score for each candidate document using\n      a technique like TF–IDF or BM25.\n\n   4) Return the document with the highest score as your best match.\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n\nCONCLUSION\n──────────\n• By creating an inverted index, applying relevance scoring (e.g., TF–IDF), \n  and retrieving only candidate documents containing query terms, you can \n  achieve O(log n) lookups per term (if the index is properly structured). \n• Sorting or selecting the best match finishes the process, ensuring you \n  terminate once you have the top candidate(s). \n• This approach scales well, and with proper indexing, meets the O(log n) \n  complexity requirement for searching.",

Clear and Explicit Instructions:  \n • In your prompt, emphasize that the output must be solely valid JSON.  \n • Example prompt addition: “Return ONLY valid JSON with no extra text outside of it.”  \n • You might include a sample of the expected JSON structure to guide the output format.\n\n2. Use of “Delimiter” Tokens:  \n • Surround your prompt with specific delimiters (e.g., “BEGIN JSON” and “END JSON”) to signal where the JSON should start and end.  \n • Some users have reported that asking the model “to output only the text between BEGIN and END tokens” helps enforce the formatting.\n\n3. Use of the OpenAI Functions or Structured Output Support (if available):\n • If using the ChatGPT API with functions support, you can specify a schema that defines the JSON structure. This can help enforce formatting rules and remove any extra commentary.\n • This is particularly useful when dealing with strictly formatted responses.\n\n4. Post-Processing:  \n • As a fallback, consider parsing the model’s response with a JSON linter/validator in your application so that any extraneous text (if present) is filtered out.\n • Alternatively, you can add a step to programmatically extract the JSON part from the returned response.\n\n5. Iterative Refinement:  \n • Start with a smaller sample invoice example and validate the returned JSON format.\n • Once verified, scale up to using real invoice data. Small discrepancies in formatting might be easier to handle in test cases.\n\nBy incorporating these practices into your API query, you can reduce the likelihood that ChatGPT will include unrequested data and ensure that your output adheres to the required JSON format. \n\nThis summary and the recommendations above represent the best match from our knowledge database regarding similar issues with PDF data extraction and JSON formatting using ChatGPT’s API.",

          "response": "The issue you're encountering is commonly related to ChatGPT (and OpenAI APIs) \"hallucinating\" or generating extra, unwanted data when asked to extract structured content (such as JSON) from PDF documents. This typically occurs because GPT models are language-based models optimized for completion and inference, rather than specialized data extraction engines. Thus, they tend to produce plausible but unrequested information.\n\nRecommended best-match solution from knowledge database:\n\n**Cause of the issue:**\n- GPT models (like ChatGPT) are language models trained to generate plausible text. They sometimes produce extra or incorrect data (\"hallucinations\"), especially when parsing PDFs or structured documents without explicit constraints.\n\n**Best practices and solutions:**\n1. **Prompt Engineering:**  \n   Clearly define your JSON schema in the prompt and emphasize explicitly that no additional data or commentary should be included.  \n   **Example:**  \n   ```\n   Extract only the following fields from the invoice PDF and return them strictly in JSON format:\n   {\n       \"invoice_number\": \"\",\n       \"CIF\": \"\",\n       \"total\": \"\",\n       \"invoice_date\": \"\",\n       \"due_date\": \"\",\n       \"VAT\": \"\"\n   }\n   Do not include any additional text or explanation.\n   ```\n\n2. **Structured Prompting (Chain-of-Thought):**  \n   If simple prompting doesn't suffice, use a two-step prompting approach:\n   - First step: Ask the model to identify and confirm the presence of the required fields.\n   - Second step: Prompt the model to output only the confirmed fields in JSON format.\n\n3. **Function Calling (OpenAI API feature):**  \n   Utilize OpenAI's function calling capability, explicitly defining the schema as a function. This significantly reduces hallucinations because the model is constrained by the function schema:\n   ```json\n   {\n     \"name\": \"invoice_data_extraction\",\n     \"description\": \"Extract specific invoice data from PDF text\",\n     \"parameters\": {\n       \"type\": \"object\",\n       \"properties\": {\n         \"invoice_number\": {\"type\": \"string\"},\n         \"CIF\": {\"type\": \"string\"},\n         \"total\": {\"type\": \"string\"},\n         \"invoice_date\": {\"type\": \"string\"},\n         \"due_date\": {\"type\": \"string\"},\n         \"VAT\": {\"type\": \"string\"}\n       },\n       \"required\": [\"invoice_number\", \"CIF\", \"total\", \"invoice_date\", \"due_date\", \"VAT\"]\n     }\n   }\n   ```\n\n4. **Preprocessing PDFs before GPT:**  \n   Instead of directly uploading PDF files to GPT, first preprocess PDFs with dedicated OCR or PDF parsing tools (e.g., PyMuPDF, PyPDF2, Tika, or OCR via Tesseract) to extract clean text. Then provide structured text (rather than raw PDF) to GPT, significantly reducing hallucinations.\n\n5. **Fine-Tuning or Specialized Models:**  \n   If extraction accuracy is critical and continuous, consider fine-tuning a GPT model on a dataset of invoices or using specialized document extraction tools, such as LayoutLM, LayoutLMv2, or commercial products (e.g., AWS Textract, Google Document AI).\n\n**Recommended Optimal Solution (best match):**\n- **Use OpenAI's function calling feature** along with preprocessing the PDF to text. This combination provides explicit schema constraints and significantly reduces hallucinations.\n\n**Complexity:**  \nO(log n) with indexing (for retrieval from knowledge base).\n\nThus, the best-matching solution is:  \n- **Preprocess PDF → Extract structured text → Provide structured prompt or function-calling schema** → **Receive constrained JSON output (no extra data).**",

          "response": "Based on the query, it seems you are facing a problem with extracting specific data from PDF invoices using OpenAI's API (and ChatGPT web). Here are some suggestions that may help you address this issue:\n\n1. **Ensure Proper Data Extraction**: The key to successfully extracting data from PDF invoices is to use a reliable and accurate data extraction method. OpenAI's API and ChatGPT web may not be the best tools for this task, as they are primarily designed for natural language processing and generation, not for structured data extraction.\n\n2. **Consider Using Specialized PDF Extraction Tools**: There are various tools and libraries available that are specifically designed for extracting data from PDF documents. Some popular options include:\n   - Tabula: A Java-based tool that can extract tables from PDF files.\n   - PyPDF2: A pure-python library built as a PDF toolkit.\n   - pdfplumber: A Python library that makes it easy to extract text, tables, and other data from PDF documents.\n   - Camelot: A Python library that can extract data from PDF tables with high accuracy.\n\n3. **Understand PDF Structure and Layout**: PDFs can have complex structures and layouts, which can make data extraction challenging. Understanding the structure of the invoices you're working with, such as the placement of specific data fields, can help you develop more accurate extraction algorithms.\n\n4. **Implement Robust Error Handling**: PDF documents can have various formatting issues, such as inconsistent layout, text recognition errors, or missing data. Your data extraction process should be able to handle these edge cases gracefully and provide meaningful error messages or fallback mechanisms.\n\n5. **Leverage Machine Learning (ML) Techniques**: If you're dealing with a large number of invoices or complex layouts, you can consider using ML-based approaches to automate the data extraction process. This may involve training models to recognize and extract specific data fields from the invoices.\n\n6. **Validate and Refine the Extracted Data**: After extracting the data, it's important to validate the accuracy and completeness of the extracted information. You can do this by comparing the extracted data with the original PDF invoices or by implementing additional checks and validations.\n\n7. **Provide Feedback to OpenAI**: If you believe that OpenAI's API or ChatGPT web could be improved for PDF data extraction tasks, you can provide feedback to the OpenAI team. This may help them enhance their services to better suit your use case.\n\nRemember, the complexity of the solution will depend on the specific requirements of your project, the complexity of the PDF invoices, and the accuracy and reliability of the data extraction methods you choose to implement.",

Do not guess or invent values. Output only a JSON object, nothing else.\n\n2. Use a Template\nProvide a sample of the exact JSON structure you want. For example:\n\n{\n  \"invoice_number\": \"\",\n  \"CIF\": \"\",\n  \"total\": \"\",\n  \"invoice_date\": \"\",\n  \"VAT\": \"\"\n}\n\nIf any field is missing, set its value as null.\n\n3. Preprocess the PDF Text\nIf possible, use a reliable PDF-to-text extraction tool before sending data to ChatGPT. Make sure the input is as clean and structured as possible. Tools like pdfplumber, PyMuPDF, or Adobe PDF Extract API can help.\n\n4. Consider the Model’s Limitations\nCurrent LLMs sometimes fill in missing fields with plausible information. To further reduce hallucinations, explicitly instruct the model not to guess or invent values.\n\n5. Post-Process the Output\nAfter receiving the JSON, verify the extracted fields programmatically. For example, if the invoice_number is not present in the PDF text, discard or flag the response.\n\n6. Use Function Calling (With the API)\nIf you are using the OpenAI API, you can define a function schema (JSON schema) for extraction. This helps the model adhere to the expected structure and limits hallucination.\n\nExample function definition:\n\n{\n  \"name\": \"extract_invoice_data\",\n  \"parameters\": {\n    \"type\": \"object\",\n    \"properties\": {\n      \"invoice_number\": {\"type\": \"string\", \"description\": \"Invoice number or null\"},\n      \"CIF\": {\"type\": \"string\", \"description\": \"CIF or null\"},\n      \"total\": {\"type\": \"string\", \"description\": \"Total amount or null\"},\n      \"invoice_date\": {\"type\": \"string\", \"description\": \"Invoice date or null\"},\n      \"VAT\": {\"type\": \"string\", \"description\": \"VAT or null\"}\n    },\n    \"required\": [\"invoice_number\", \"CIF\", \"total\", \"invoice_date\", \"VAT\"]\n  }\n}\n\n7. Limit the Context\nOnly send the relevant text (not the entire PDF) to the model. This reduces confusion and hallucination.\n\nExample Prompt for API or ChatGPT:\n\nBelow is the extracted text from an invoice. Extract only these fields: invoice_number, CIF, total, invoice_date, VAT. If a value is missing, use null. Output only this JSON object and nothing else: { \"invoice_number\": \"\", \"CIF\": \"\", \"total\": \"\", \"invoice_date\": \"\", \"VAT\": \"\" }\n[PASTE EXTRACTED TEXT HERE]\n\nIf you share more details or a sample of your prompt and output, I can help you craft an even better prompt or processing pipeline.\n\nLet me know if you need code examples for Python or API usage!",

Below are some approaches and best practices to help you get the clean JSON output you need and reduce hallucinations or irrelevant content.\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n1. Use a Dedicated PDF Text Extraction Process\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n• ChatGPT does not natively “see” the PDF’s structure; it only sees whatever text you provide. This can cause missing or invented data if the PDF text isn’t clearly given in the prompt.  \n• Use a PDF parsing library (e.g., PyPDF2, pdfplumber, or a commercial tool) to extract the textual content from the invoice first. Then feed that extracted text to ChatGPT.  \n• Make sure you provide a small but sufficient snippet of text relevant to the fields you want: invoice number, date, VAT, totals, etc.\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n2. Craft a System or Instruction Prompt for JSON-Only Output\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nWhether you are using the ChatGPT UI or the API, you can use prompt instructions to increase the likelihood of receiving valid JSON. For example:\n\nSystem Message (or initial instruction):\n“You are a helpful AI assistant who extracts information from texts and returns only valid JSON. You should never include any additional commentary or extraneous text.”\n\nUser Message (with the invoice text included):\n“Below is the extracted text from an invoice. Extract the following fields:  \n• invoice_number  \n• cif  \n• total  \n• date  \n• vat  \nIf a field is missing, use null or an empty string.  \nOutput ONLY valid JSON following this schema (no markdown, no extra explanation):  \n\n{\n  \"invoice_number\": \"\",\n  \"cif\": \"\",\n  \"total\": \"\",\n  \"date\": \"\",\n  \"vat\": \"\"\n}\n\nText from invoice:\n[Paste relevant lines from PDF here…]”\n\nThis style of prompt strongly discourages ChatGPT from adding extra commentary.\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n3. Leverage Function Calling (OpenAI Chat Completions)\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nOpenAI’s Chat Completions API includes a “function calling” feature which enforces the structure of the response as valid JSON. If you define a function with the arguments that map to your desired fields, the model can only respond in a JSON shape that matches those arguments.\n\nExample function specification in your API request:\n\"functions\": [\n  {\n    \"name\": \"extract_invoice_data\",\n    \"description\": \"Extract required invoice data\",\n    \"parameters\": {\n      \"type\": \"object\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"invoice_number\": {\"type\": \"string\"},\n        \"cif\": {\"type\": \"string\"},\n        \"total\": {\"type\": \"string\"},\n        \"date\": {\"type\": \"string\"},\n        \"vat\": {\"type\": \"string\"}\n      },\n      \"required\": [\"invoice_number\", \"cif\", \"total\", \"date\", \"vat\"]\n    }\n  }\n]\n\nWhen you pass your conversation to the API:\n• Add a system or user message that includes the extracted PDF text.  \n• Ask the model to call the function “extract_invoice_data”.  \n• The model will then respond with a “function_call” containing strictly the JSON arguments.\n\nThis approach forces the JSON structure you want and omits extraneous text by design.\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n4. Prompt Mitigations to Reduce Hallucination\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n• Use lower temperature: In the OpenAI API, set \"temperature\": 0 or a low value like 0.2 to reduce creativity.  \n• Explicitly ask ChatGPT to produce “null” or an empty string for any field if it’s not found in the text. If ChatGPT “guesses,” it’s more likely to hallucinate.  \n• Provide direct instructions: “If the information is not explicitly stated, return an empty string (‘’) rather than guessing.”\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n5. Post-Processing as a Safety Net\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n• If you have control over the client receiving ChatGPT’s response, you can:  \n  – Parse the response as JSON.  \n  – Validate the JSON structure (e.g., using a JSON schema validator).  \n  – If the response fails validation or if extraneous fields exist, you can retry the query or automatically remove them.  \n\n• Always treat ChatGPT output as potentially unverified. If certain fields (e.g., totals, taxes) must be correct, consider verifying them through a separate calculation or matching them against known formats or placeholders from the invoice text.\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nSummary\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n1. Extract the text from the PDF first using a reliable PDF parsing library.  \n2. Provide clear instructions that the response must be valid JSON with no additional commentary.  \n3. Use system messages and low temperature to reduce hallucinations.  \n4. Consider the function calling feature in the Chat Completions API to enforce the JSON shape strictly.  \n5. Validate the JSON after receiving it to catch any structural or content errors.\n\nBy combining explicit “JSON-only” prompts or function calls, careful PDF-to-text extraction, and validation, you can reliably obtain structured invoice data (invoice number, CIF, total, date, VAT, etc.) while minimizing hallucination and unwanted text in ChatGPT’s response.",

          "response": "It sounds like you’re running into an issue where ChatGPT, when asked to extract specific fields from a PDF invoice, sometimes returns extra text (or “noise”) around your JSON output. This is a common challenge when asking language models to produce strictly formatted outputs such as JSON. Here are some ideas and strategies you can try:\n\n1. Use Clear and Specific Instructions:\n  • In your prompt, explicitly state that the entire output must be valid JSON and nothing else.\n  • Consider providing a “template” or “schema” with example keys and values (or null/empty placeholders) to guide the output. For example:\n  \n  \"Extract the following fields from the invoice: invoiceNumber, CIF, total, invoiceDate, VAT. Output exactly one JSON object following this schema:\n  {\n   \"invoiceNumber\": \"<invoice number>\",\n   \"CIF\": \"<CIF>\",\n   \"total\": \"<total amount>\",\n   \"invoiceDate\": \"<date>\",\n   \"VAT\": \"<VAT amount>\"\n  }\n  Do not include any explanations or additional text.\"\n\n2. Use “Start” and “End” Markers:\n  • You can instruct the model to begin with a specific token (like “<json>”) and end with another (like “</json>”). Then, in your processing code, you can extract the text enclosed by these delimiters.\n  \n  For example:\n  \"Please output the answer as JSON only, starting with <json> and ending with </json>.\"\n\n3. Post-process the Output:\n  • If occasional extra text appears, consider implementing a post-processing step in your API client code:\n   – Use a function to identify and extract the valid JSON part.\n   – Try to parse the returned text using a JSON parser (e.g., JSON.parse in JavaScript or json.loads in Python). If parsing fails, attempt to trim out any non-JSON parts.\n  • This is particularly helpful if ChatGPT sometimes adds disclaimers or additional context.\n\n4. Be Aware of PDF Input Limitations:\n  • Remember that when you “upload” or provide the content of a PDF invoice, the way you extract or pass that content can influence the result. If the text extraction (or OCR if needed) is not clean, the extra text might be coming from there. Consider pre-processing the PDF outside of ChatGPT if possible, and then sending a text version that’s already been cleaned up.\n  • Sometimes the PDF text includes header or footer information that might confuse the output formatting.\n\n5. Use Temperature and Response Settings:\n  • Lowering the temperature might result in less “creative” responses. A lower temperature (like 0 or 0.2) could help keep the model on task strictly extracting the JSON.\n  • When using the API, follow exact instructions in your prompt and possibly use the “system” message to reinforce the output format requirements.\n\n6. Experiment with Few-Shot Prompts:\n  • Provide a few examples of input PDFs (or their text representations) and the correct JSON output. By seeing a pattern, the model might be more likely to follow the exact format you want.\n\nBy combining these strategies, you can greatly increase the chance that ChatGPT produces exactly the JSON output you need. If you still receive extra bits of text, incorporating a post-processing step to extract valid JSON is a robust fallback for your application.",

          "response": "Thanks for sharing the profiler output and your question!\n\n**Issue Summary:**  \nWhen you upload a real PDF invoice and ask ChatGPT (via the API or web) to extract structured data as JSON (e.g., invoice number, CIF, total, dates, VAT), the response sometimes contains data that:\n\n- Is incomplete,\n- Is hallucinated (fabricated or inaccurate),\n- Or doesn't match the values in the PDF.\n\n**Why does this happen?**\n1. **PDF Parsing Limitations:**  \n   The AI doesn't read PDFs natively. It relies on an intermediate step to extract text and layout from the PDF. If the PDF is complex, scanned, or formatted with tables/images, the extracted text can be garbled or incomplete.\n\n2. **Optical Character Recognition (OCR) Errors:**  \n   If your PDF is a scan/image, OCR might misread characters (e.g., turning \"8\" into \"B\"), leading to incorrect values.\n\n3. **Model Hallucination:**  \n   The model sometimes \"fills in\" missing data or guesses based on context, especially if the input is ambiguous or the extracted text is incomplete.\n\n4. **Prompt Ambiguity:**  \n   If the prompt isn't very clear about what to do when data is missing, the model might invent values rather than returning null/empty for missing fields.\n\n**How to Improve Results:**\n- **Text Extraction Quality:**  \n  Use a dedicated PDF-to-text or PDF-to-structured-data library (like pdfplumber, PyPDF2, or Tesseract for OCR) before sending the content to the AI. Send only the clean, relevant text.\n\n- **Prompt Engineering:**  \n  Be explicit in your prompt. For example:\n  ```\n  Extract the following fields from the provided invoice text. If a field is missing, set its value to null. Return only the JSON object, with these keys: [\"invoice_number\", \"CIF\", \"total\", \"date\", \"VAT\", ...].\n  ```\n- **Sample Prompt:**\n  ```\n  Here is the text extracted from an invoice:\n  [PASTE EXTRACTED TEXT HERE]\n  Please return a JSON object with these keys: [\"invoice_number\", \"CIF\", \"total\", \"date\", \"VAT\"]. If any key is missing from the invoice, set its value to null. Do not invent or guess values.\n  ```\n\n- **Post-Processing:**  \n  Validate the AI's output programmatically for expected value formats (e.g., invoice numbers, VAT IDs) and cross-check with the source if possible.\n\n**Summary Table:**\n\n| Problem            | Cause                                 | Solution                              |\n|--------------------|---------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|\n| Incomplete data    | Bad text extraction/OCR errors         | Use better extraction tools           |\n| Hallucinated data  | Model fills gaps, prompt ambiguity     | Explicit prompts, validation          |\n| Formatting issues  | Model misunderstanding                | Strict JSON schema in prompt          |\n\n**Extra Tips:**\n- Always review the extracted text before sending it to the AI.\n- If possible, automate extraction and validation using code rather than relying solely on AI.\n\nLet me know if you want code samples or recommendations for specific PDF extraction tools!",

It appears that the user is encountering an issue with extraneous or incorrect data returned in ChatGPT’s responses when using real PDF invoices.  \n\nIf you are aiming to refine the extraction process so that ChatGPT returns only the specific JSON structure and values you want, here are a few tips:\n\n1. Provide Clear Instructions in Your Prompt:  \n   – Explicitly state the exact JSON keys and the expected format.  \n   – For instance, tell ChatGPT: “Extract the following elements from the invoice and return only the JSON. Do not include any additional text, commentary, or formatting. Return the JSON in this structure…”.\n\n2. Use a Well-Defined Schema and Possibly Examples:  \n   – If you show ChatGPT an example JSON structure (e.g., a minimal, fake invoice to illustrate the format) and ask it to mimic the structure, ChatGPT is more likely to remain consistent.  \n   – Consider including a short example:  \n     {  \n       \"invoiceNumber\": \"<string>\",  \n       \"CIF\": \"<string>\",  \n       \"total\": \"<decimal>\",  \n       \"date\": \"<string>\",  \n       \"VAT\": \"<decimal>\"  \n     }  \n\n3. Check for Hallucinated Data:  \n   – ChatGPT sometimes infers or “hallucinates” data if it is not explicitly found in the text. Make sure you let ChatGPT know if the data should be labeled as null, empty, or omitted when not actually present on the invoice.\n\n4. Use the Latest Models and Features:  \n   – If using the ChatGPT API, confirm you’re calling the model best suited for structured data extraction (like gpt-3.5-turbo or a newer version).  \n   – Consider using the ChatGPT function calling feature (if available in your environment) to strictly define the desired JSON schema.\n\n5. Implement a Post-Processing Layer:  \n   – If you receive partial or extraneous text in the ChatGPT response, you can parse the response programmatically to extract only the JSON substring, then validate or clean it before using it downstream.\n\nBy clarifying your prompt and leveraging a post-processing step, you can reduce unwanted text or hallucinated data and get more reliable JSON outputs from ChatGPT. If needed, you can share more details about your prompt or code so others can help debug further.",

Extraction Specificity:  \n If the returned JSON includes additional data beyond your specified keys, it may be due to the extraction logic or how the prompt is structured. You might want to refine your prompt or add more detailed instructions to ensure that only the required keys are returned.\n\n2. Input Truncation?  \n The input shown in the profiler output seems to be cut off (“...the response contains data tha”). If that’s unintentional, make sure you’re sending the complete data request to the API for more accurate debugging.\n\n3. Real PDF Parsing:  \n When dealing with real PDF invoices, variability in layout and data formats can lead to extra extracted data. Consider whether you might need to post-process the JSON output to filter only the keys you need.\n\nCould you clarify what kind of help you’re looking for? For example:\n • Are you trying to understand these profiler metrics?\n • Do you need help refining the prompt/API call so that only your specified keys are returned in the JSON?\n • Or are you troubleshooting why the JSON output sometimes contains extra data?\n\nLet me know what specific guidance you’re after, and I’ll be happy to assist further!",

You can adapt the details to match your project’s specifics.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nREADME.md\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n# My Processor Tool\n\nA command-line tool to process text-based requests—particularly useful for extracting or transforming data. This README outlines how to get started, the steps the tool follows, and an example of how to use it.\n\n## Features\n\n• Validates input for correctness and safety.  \n• Executes processing steps (e.g., data extraction, transformation, summarization) based on the user’s request.  \n• Returns results in a structured format.\n\n## Task Processing\n\nThe processing flow for any given request follows three steps:\n\n1. **Validate Input**  \n   Verify that the input is well-formed and does not contain anything disallowed or unprocessable (e.g., checking for empty input, malformed parameters, etc.).\n\n2. **Execute Processing**  \n   Once the input is validated, the core logic runs to accomplish the requested task—such as extracting JSON data from a PDF invoice or any other transformation.\n\n3. **Return Result**  \n   After execution, the tool provides the result in the desired format (JSON, text, CSV, etc.).\n\n## Example Usage\n\nBelow is an example command demonstrating how to use the tool by passing in a request:\n\n```bash\n./processor \"Hello, I’m using OpenAI’s API (and ChatGPT web) to extract data from PDF invoices, requesting only a JSON output with specific keys, such as invoice number, CIF, total, dates, VAT, etc. \nProblem: When I upload a real PDF invoice and ask ChatGPT to extract the data as JSON, the response contains data that...\"\n```\n\n### What Happens?\n\n1. The tool reads your request (the entire string).  \n2. It validates that the request is a non-empty string, checks for any required parameters, and so on.  \n3. The tool then runs its processing steps—which could include parsing, calling APIs, or other operations you’ve configured.  \n4. It finally returns a structured output (for instance, a JSON object with the desired keys).\n\n## Requirements\n\n• [Language/Runtime Requirements] (e.g., Python 3.9 or later)  \n• [Libraries/Dependencies]  \n\n## Installation\n\n1. Clone this repository:  \n   git clone https://github.com/user/my-processor.git\n\n2. Navigate into the directory:  \n   cd my-processor\n\n3. Install dependencies (if necessary):  \n   pip install -r requirements.txt\n\n4. (Optional) Give execution permission on Unix-based systems:  \n   chmod +x processor\n\n5. Done! You can now run the tool.\n\n## Contributing\n\n1. Fork the repository.  \n2. Make your feature addition or bug fix.  \n3. Send a pull request for review.\n\n## License\n\n[Specify the license under which your project is shared, e.g., MIT, Apache 2.0, etc.]\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nFeel free to expand on any of these sections according to the specific needs of your project, including detailed examples of outputs, supported parameters, troubleshooting tips, or any environment constraints.",

You also seem to be describing an issue where the extracted data is not precise or contains hallucinated information.\n\nLet’s address your scenario step by step.\n\n### 1. Your GraphQL Schema\n\n```graphql\ntype Mutation {\n  processRequest(input: String!): ProcessingResult\n}\n\ntype ProcessingResult {\n  success: Boolean!\n  message: String\n}\n```\n\nThis schema defines a mutation named processRequest that takes a String (input) and returns a ProcessingResult with a success status and a message.\n\n---\n\n### 2. Your Problem\n\nYou’re using the OpenAI API/ChatGPT to extract structured JSON data from PDF invoices, but the model sometimes \"hallucinates\" or returns imprecise/extraneous data.\n\n---\n\n### 3. Suggestions\n\n**A. Improve Prompt Engineering**\n\n- **Explicit Instructions:** Be very clear in your prompt that the output should only include specific keys and that if a field is missing, it should be null or omitted.\n- **Example Prompt:**\n\n  ```\n  Extract the following fields from this invoice PDF text: \n  - invoice_number\n  - CIF\n  - total\n  - invoice_date\n  - due_date\n  - VAT\n\n  Return only a valid JSON object with these keys. If a value is missing, use null.\n\n  Here is the extracted text:\n  [PASTE PDF TEXT HERE]\n  ```\n\n**B. Preprocess PDF Text**\n\n- Use OCR or PDF parsing libraries (like pdfplumber, PyMuPDF, or Tesseract) to extract clean text before sending it to the API.\n- Remove headers, footers, or unrelated content to reduce noise.\n\n**C. Post-Process Results**\n\n- Validate the JSON output in your backend before accepting it as correct.\n- Use regular expressions or schema validation to ensure the keys and values are appropriate.\n\n**D. Use Function Calling (OpenAI API)**\n\nIf you’re using GPT-4 Turbo or newer, leverage OpenAI’s function calling feature to directly extract structured data. Define the expected schema in the function parameters, and the model will only populate those fields.\n\n**E. Consider Fine-Tuning**\n\nIf you have a lot of invoices and consistent formats, consider fine-tuning a model on your specific data extraction task.\n\n---\n\n### 4. Sample GraphQL Resolver (Pseudo-code)\n\nHere’s how you might structure your resolver for `processRequest`:\n\n```js\nconst { openai } = require('openai-api-client');\n\nasync function processRequest(parent, { input }) {\n  // Send input to OpenAI API with a carefully crafted prompt\n  const prompt = `\n    Extract the following fields from the invoice text: \n    invoice_number, CIF, total, invoice_date, due_date, VAT.\n    Respond only with a JSON object. Use null for missing fields.\n    Text: ${input}\n  `;\n  const response = await openai.createCompletion({\n    model: 'gpt-4',\n    prompt,\n    max_tokens: 300,\n    temperature: 0,\n  });\n\n  // Try to parse the JSON output\n  let data;\n  try {\n    data = JSON.parse(response.choices[0].text);\n    return { success: true, message: JSON.stringify(data) };\n  } catch (e) {\n    return { success: false, message: \"Failed to parse JSON: \" + e.message };\n  }\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n### 5. Summary\n\n- **Clarify your prompt** to minimize hallucinations.\n- **Clean your input text** as much as possible.\n- **Validate the output** before using it.\n- **Use function calling** if available.\n\nIf you provide more details about your workflow or the full input/output, I can give more targeted advice or code examples!",

Example Server-Side Resolver (Pseudocode)\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nBelow is a simple Node.js/TypeScript–style resolver showing how you could handle the logic. \n(This can be adapted for other environments or languages.)\n\nconst resolvers = {\n  Mutation: {\n    processRequest: async (_parent: any, args: { input: string }): Promise<ProcessingResult> => {\n      const userMessage = args.input;\n      \n      // You could integrate OpenAI’s API call here to process the PDF content.\n      // For demonstration, we'll mock the response:\n      let extractionResult;\n      try {\n        // e.g., call an OpenAI function to parse your invoice PDF\n        // extractionResult = await openAIService.extractInvoiceData(userMessage);\n\n        // Mocked output (substitute with real logic):\n        extractionResult = {\n          invoiceNumber: \"1234-ABCDE\",\n          cif: \"A12345678\",\n          total: \"1500.00\",\n          dates: [\"2023-09-01\", \"2023-09-15\"],\n          vat: \"21%\",\n        };\n\n        // Return success along with a JSON string of extracted data:\n        return {\n          success: true,\n          message: JSON.stringify(extractionResult),\n        };\n      } catch (error) {\n        // Log the error, or handle as needed\n        console.error(\"Error processing request:\", error);\n\n        // Return a failure response\n        return {\n          success: false,\n          message: \"An error occurred while processing the request.\",\n        };\n      }\n    },\n  },\n};\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n4. Sample Response\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nIf the mutation is successful, the JSON you get back might look like this:\n\n{\n  \"data\": {\n    \"processRequest\": {\n      \"success\": true,\n      \"message\": \"{\\\"invoiceNumber\\\":\\\"1234-ABCDE\\\",\\\"cif\\\":\\\"A12345678\\\",\\\"total\\\":\\\"1500.00\\\",\\\"dates\\\":[\\\"2023-09-01\\\",\\\"2023-09-15\\\"],\\\"vat\\\":\\\"21%\\\"}\"\n    }\n  }\n}\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n5. Notes and Further Considerations\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n• Input/Output Types:  \n  - For more sophisticated requests, you could define an input type (e.g., “ExtractInvoiceInput”) instead of using a single String! argument.  \n  - Likewise, you might want to define a dedicated type for your returned PDF invoice data (instead of bundling it into the “message” field) if you want to strongly type the fields in your GraphQL schema.\n\n• Handling Real PDF Content:  \n  - If you are sending raw or base64-encoded PDF data to your resolver, you may want to use a custom scalar or attachment approach, depending on how large the file is.  \n  - Alternatively, store the file somewhere (e.g., S3) and send only the URL to your resolver, which fetches and processes it.\n\n• Preventing Hallucinations or Incorrect Data from the Model:  \n  - Consider using a more structured prompt and examples when calling the OpenAI API (for instance, a few-shot example) to reduce inaccuracies.  \n  - You can also implement a post-processing validator that checks whether each expected field matches known invoice patterns (like invoice number formats, date formats, etc.).\n\nBy following the schema above and implementing a resolver that ties into your PDF extraction (via OpenAI or another method), you’ll have a clean way to request data and respond in JSON.",

          "response": "It looks like you’re outlining a GraphQL mutation that wraps a PDF invoice processing task. In your schema you have:\n\n• A Mutation called processRequest that accepts a required input of type String.  \n• A ProcessingResult type that returns a Boolean success flag and a message (which might be the JSON output or an error message).\n\nFrom your input string it appears you’re making a call like this:\n\n processRequest(input: \"Hello, I’m using OpenAI’s API (and ChatGPT web) to extract data from PDF invoices, requesting only a JSON output with specific keys, such as invoice number, CIF, total, dates, VAT, etc. Problem: When I upload a real PDF invoice and ask ChatGPT to extract the data as JSON, the response contains data tha…\")\n\nIn other words, you’re sending a message that includes both your prompt and details about a problem:\n – You want only a JSON output with specific keys.\n – When using a real PDF invoice, ChatGPT’s response appears to include additional, unwanted data.\n\nIf your goal is to wrap this functionality in an API, here are a few suggestions:\n\n1. Clarify the contract of your API:  \n • Your processRequest mutation accepts a raw query string (which might be a prompt for ChatGPT).  \n • It returns a ProcessingResult. You might consider renaming “message” to something like “result” or “jsonPayload” if that field is meant to contain the JSON output, or add another field to distinguish between an error message and the actual data.\n\n2. Rework your prompt/response instructions:  \n • Ensure that your prompt instructs ChatGPT unambiguously. For example, include instructions like “Return only the JSON format with exactly the following keys” and maybe also “Do not include any additional text, explanations, or code fences.”\n • You can also wrap the prompt in delimiters so that it’s clear to ChatGPT which part is the instruction and which part is the raw data.\n\n3. Post-processing and validation:  \n • Since ChatGPT sometimes includes unexpected data (especially if the source content is complex, like a full PDF invoice), you could add a post-processing step in your GraphQL resolver that validates the output.  \n • For example, try to parse the returned string as JSON and either clean or reject outputs that do not conform to your expected schema.\n\n4. Consider creating a more comprehensive GraphQL schema:  \n If you expect the JSON to have specific keys (invoice number, CIF, total, dates, VAT, etc.), you could define a dedicated type:\n  type InvoiceData {\n   invoiceNumber: String!\n   cif: String!\n   total: Float!\n   date: String!\n   vat: Float\n  }\n  \n Then have your mutation return:\n  type ProcessingResult {\n   success: Boolean!\n   invoiceData: InvoiceData\n   message: String\n  }\n This adds a layer of type safety, ensuring that you eventually process the response into a structured format before sending it to the client.\n\n5. Guard against truncation and incomplete responses:  \n • The snippet you posted seems to be truncated (“...contains data tha”). When dealing with real PDFs and long prompts, care must be taken to ensure the entire text is processed correctly.\n • Check if the truncation happens in the communication with ChatGPT or during the API’s input/output handling.\n\nIn summary, your schema is a good starting point for encapsulating the PDF-to-JSON extraction process. The key challenges lie in tuning the prompt and handling the response from ChatGPT so that it returns exactly what you need. Depending on the complexity of your invoices, you might have to refine the prompt instructions or add a validation step to ensure that only valid JSON with the expected keys is passed along.\n\nIf you’d like further guidance on any of these steps (for example, how to write a precise prompt or how to parse and validate the JSON output within your GraphQL resolver), just let me know!",

Also, your regex is very hard to read and modify, and it may have issues with curly/smart quotes (’), whitespace (\\s+), and comma/period handling.\n\nLet’s address your points:\n\n### 1. Case-insensitivity\nYou don’t need to wrap every letter in a character class (`[hH]`). Use the `/i` flag at the end of your regex to make it case-insensitive.\n\n### 2. Quotes\nYou used the curly apostrophe (’). If users might input straight quote ('), allow both.\n\n### 3. Whitespace\n`\\s+` matches any whitespace (space, tab, newline), which is good, but if you want to allow for flexible spaces, you might want to use `\\s*`.\n\n### 4. Escaping special characters\nRemember to escape special regex characters (like parentheses, brackets, periods).\n\n### 5. Maintainability\nConsider building your regex as a string, or even splitting into smaller segments.\n\n---\n\n## Improved Regex Example\n\nHere’s how you could improve your validation:\n\n```javascript\nconst pattern = /^hello,\\s*i['’]m\\s+using\\s+openai['’]s\\s+api\\s+\\(and\\s+chatgpt\\s+web\\)\\s+to\\s+extract\\s+data\\s+from\\s+pdf\\s+invoices,\\s+requesting\\s+only\\s+a\\s+json\\s+output\\s+with\\s+specific\\s+keys,\\s+such\\s+as\\s+invoice\\s+number,\\s+cif,\\s+total,\\s+dates,\\s+vat,\\s+etc\\.problem:when\\s+i\\s+upload\\s+a\\s+real\\s+pdf\\s+invoice\\s+and\\s+ask\\s+chatgpt\\s+to\\s+extract\\s+the\\s+data\\s+as\\s+json,\\s+the\\s+response\\s+contains\\s+data\\s+tha/i;\n\nif (pattern.test(input)) {\n    processRequest(input);\n} else {\n    reject(\"Invalid format\");\n}\n```\n\n- Uses `/i` for case-insensitivity.\n- Accepts both `'` and `’` for apostrophes.\n- `\\s+` for whitespace.\n- Escapes parentheses and period.\n- Much more maintainable and readable.\n\n---\n\n## **Recommendation**\n\n**Regex is not ideal for validating such long, natural language inputs.**  \nIf you need to check for a template or pattern, consider splitting the input into steps or looking for key phrases in order.\n\nFor example:\n\n```javascript\nconst requiredPhrases = [\n  /hello/i,\n  /i['’]m using openai['’]s api/i,\n  /chatgpt web/i,\n  /extract data from pdf invoices/i,\n  /json output/i,\n  /invoice number/i,\n  /cif/i,\n  /total/i,\n  /dates/i,\n  /vat/i,\n  /problem:when/i,\n  /upload.*pdf invoice/i,\n  /extract the data as json/i,\n  /response contains data/i\n];\n\nconst allMatched = requiredPhrases.every(re => re.test(input));\nif (allMatched) {\n    processRequest(input);\n} else {\n    reject(\"Invalid format\");\n}\n```\n\nThis approach is much more robust and maintainable.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \n- Use `/i` for case-insensitivity.\n- Escape special characters.\n- Allow for both `'` and `’`.\n- Prefer phrase matching for very long, specific texts.\n\n**Regex is best for short, well-defined patterns, not for full-page text matching.**  \nIf you must use regex, simplify as above. If not, use structured phrase checks.",

Case-Insensitive (i) Flag  \n   • Instead of writing [hH], [eE], etc., you can just write the words normally and let /.../i handle upper/lowercase matching.\n\n2. Unified Apostrophe Handling  \n   • The original pattern used a curly apostrophe (’). By using (?:’|'|‘)? you can allow for different apostrophe types (straight, curly, etc.) without failing the match.\n\n3. Cleaner and More Maintainable  \n   • Eliminating the letter-by-letter bracket syntax makes the expression far easier to read and modify in the future.\n\n4. Anchors and Exact Matching (Optional)  \n   • In the example, ^ and $ anchors are used at the start/end of the pattern to ensure you match the entire string exactly. If you need partial matches, you can remove those anchors.\n\nBy adjusting your pattern to rely on the case-insensitive flag and a small character class for apostrophes, you avoid nearly all of the pitfalls of enumerating letters and ensure your match will still work if the user types with curly quotes or has minor variations in capitalization.",

          "response": "Below is an explanation of your regex and some suggestions for improvement.\n\n───────────────────────────── \nOverview of Your Regex\n\nYour code checks if the input string exactly follows this long, specific format. For example, it must start with:\n  \"hello, I'm using openai's api (and chatgpt web) to extract data from pdf invoices, requesting only a json output with specific keys, such as invoice number, cif, total, dates, vat, etc.problem: when i upload a real pdf invoice and ask chatgpt to extract the data as json, the response contains data tha\"\n\nNotice that every word is “hard‐coded” and each character is matched by an expression like [hH] for “h” (either lowercase or uppercase). In other words, the regex manually lists both cases for every letter.\n\n───────────────────────────── \nWhat It Does\n\n1. It starts by matching [hH][eE][lL][lL][oO] – so “hello” in any letter case.\n2. It then requires a comma “,” literally, and continues on with a similarly strict match for each subsequent word and punctuation.\n3. It uses \\s+ between most words so that one or more whitespace characters must separate the tokens.\n4. A segment like \\([aA][nN][dD]\\s+[cC][hH][aA][tT][gG][pP][tT]\\s+[wW][eE][bB]\\) requires exactly “(and chatgpt web)” (with the parentheses escaped) with at least one space in between.\n5. At the end you have the global and case-insensitive flags /g and /i. (The /i flag makes it case‐insensitive so you wouldn’t strictly need to list both cases for each letter.)\n\n───────────────────────────── \nRedundancy and Improvements\n\nBecause you already use the /i flag, your regex does not need to enumerate both uppercase and lowercase individually. For example, this:\n\n  [hH][eE][lL][lL][oO]\n\ncould be simply written as:\n\n  hello\n\n(with the /i flag, “Hello”, “HELLO”, etc. will match).\n\nAlso note that the /g flag is typically used when you want to find all matches in a string. For a validation test where you simply care about a complete match, you might want to use .test() or anchor your regex with ^ and $ to ensure the entire input matches. For example:\n\n  if (/^hello, I'm using openai's api \\(and chatgpt web\\) … [rest of text] …$/i.test(input)) {\n   processRequest(input);\n  } else {\n   reject(\"Invalid format\");\n  }\n\nThis way, the regex will only pass if the input exactly conforms to the format.\n\n───────────────────────────── \nA Cleaner Version\n\nAssuming you want an exact match with the same spacing and punctuation, here’s how you might simplify your regex:\n  \n  if (/^hello,\\s+I'm\\s+using\\s+openai's\\s+api\\s+\\(and\\s+chatgpt\\s+web\\)\\s+to\\s+extract\\s+data\\s+from\\s+pdf\\s+invoices,\\s+requesting\\s+only\\s+a\\s+json\\s+output\\s+with\\s+specific\\s+keys,\\s+such\\s+as\\s+invoice\\s+number,\\s+cif,\\s+total,\\s+dates,\\s+vat,\\s+etc\\.problem:\\s+when\\s+i\\s+upload\\s+a\\s+real\\s+pdf\\s+invoice\\s+and\\s+ask\\s+chatgpt\\s+to\\s+extract\\s+the\\s+data\\s+as\\s+json,\\s+the\\s+response\\s+contains\\s+data\\s+tha$/i.test(input)) {\n   processRequest(input);\n  } else {\n   reject(\"Invalid format\");\n  }\n\nThis version:\n• Uses literal strings (since /i takes care of case).\n• Uses \\s+ to allow for one or more white-space characters.\n• Uses anchors ^ and $ to ensure the entire string is validated.\n• Escapes punctuation characters like ( and ) or . as needed.\n\n───────────────────────────── \nSummary\n\n• Your original regex works in that it checks for a very specific format.\n• It is redundant since the /i flag makes the individual [xX] checks unnecessary.\n• Consider anchoring your regex to avoid partial matches.\n• Depending on the use case, you might want to relax the matching of white space and punctuation to be more tolerant, or keep it strict if that is required.\n\nFeel free to ask further questions or clarifications on improving or adapting this regex!",

It's inefficient, as it uses character classes for each letter instead of simpler case-insensitive matching.\n4. It appears to be truncated at the end, as the last word \"tha\" is incomplete.\n\nA better approach would be to simplify the validation logic. If you need to check for specific keywords or patterns, consider breaking it down into smaller, more manageable checks. For example:\n\n```javascript\nfunction validateInput(input) {\n  const requiredKeywords = [\n    'OpenAI', 'API', 'ChatGPT', 'PDF', 'invoice', 'JSON', 'extract'\n  ];\n  \n  const lowercaseInput = input.toLowerCase();\n  \n  return requiredKeywords.every(keyword => \n    lowercaseInput.includes(keyword.toLowerCase())\n  );\n}\n\nif (validateInput(input)) {\n  processRequest(input);\n} else {\n  reject(\"Invalid format\");\n}\n```\n\nThis approach is more flexible, easier to read and maintain, and can be easily modified to add or remove required keywords. It checks if all required keywords are present in the input, regardless of their order or exact phrasing.\n\nIf you need more specific validation, consider using multiple smaller regex patterns or other string manipulation techniques rather than one monolithic regex.",
