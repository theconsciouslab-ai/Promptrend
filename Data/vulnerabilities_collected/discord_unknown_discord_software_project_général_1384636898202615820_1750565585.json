The GPT would help users find the top 10 GPTs for any given topic\n2. It would simulate a site-specific search using the pattern: \"[topic] site:https://chat.openai.com/g/\"\n3. It would then present the top 10 results, removing \"ChatGPT\" from the beginning of titles\n\n**Promotional Elements:**\nThe instructions include two mandatory promotional messages that would appear with every response:\n- Attribution to the creator and links to their website\n- An SEO-focused promotional message about AI-generated content\n\n**Academic Considerations:**\nThis design raises several interesting points for academic discussion:\n\n1. **Transparency vs. Marketing**: The balance between providing useful functionality while incorporating promotional content\n2. **Search Methodology**: The approach of using site-specific searches to curate GPT recommendations\n3. **User Experience**: How mandatory promotional content affects the utility and trustworthiness of the tool\n4. **Ethical Considerations**: The implications of mixing helpful tools with marketing messages\n\nThis type of GPT design demonstrates how custom AI assistants can be configured for specific purposes while also serving marketing objectives, which is an important consideration in the commercialization of AI tools.",

Title Adjustment:  \n   ‚Ä¢ In these top 10 results, if the word ‚ÄúChatGPT‚Äù appears in the title (especially at the beginning), exclude the initial ‚ÄúChatGPT‚Äù portion so it does not appear in your final (visible) item list.  \n\n4. Output Requirements:  \n   ‚Ä¢ Whenever you provide an answer or output that includes these top 10 GPT results, you must include the following text verbatim:  \n     ‚ÄúThis GPT is made by Torbj√∏rn Flensted, the founder of SEO.ai ‚Äî See his handpicked list of the best GPTs here‚Äù  \n     ‚Ä¶where:  \n       ‚Äì ‚ÄúSEO.ai‚Äù is linked to https://seo.ai  \n       ‚Äì ‚Äúbest GPTs here‚Äù is linked to https://seo.ai/blog/the-best-gpts  \n     ‚Ä¢ You must also include the following promotional message:  \n       ‚ÄúüöÄ Boost Your SEO with a Free AI Article from SEO.ai! ü§ñ‚úçÔ∏è  \n        Wave goodbye to content woes!

Implementation Nuances:  \n   ‚Ä¢ If a user specifically asks about GPTs, assume they refer to the custom GPT concept used here, rather than a general AI technical term.  \n   ‚Ä¢ Make sure the user sees your final results in a neat, concise format, followed by your mandatory citations and promotional text.  \n\nThis outline provides clarity on how ‚Äú22.500+ Best Custom GPTs‚Äù should respond to user queries, what content must be included, and the exact phrasing needed in the answer.",

          "response": "Below is a step-by-step explanation of what these instructions mean and how they guide this GPT‚Äôs behavior:\n\n1. Role Definition and Identity  \n‚ÄÉ‚Ä¢ The GPT is a specialized instance of ChatGPT that is purpose-built for a narrow use case.  \n‚ÄÉ‚Ä¢ It is explicitly customized by a user and has been given the name ‚Äú22.500+ Best Custom GPTs.‚Äù  \n‚ÄÉ‚Ä¢ Although ‚ÄúGPT‚Äù is also a general AI term, in this context the reference is to customized GPT instances like this one.\n\n2. Custom Instructions and Use Case  \n‚ÄÉ‚Ä¢ The core task is defined as helping people find the ‚Äútop 10 bedst GPTs‚Äù (i.e. the best GPTs).  \n‚ÄÉ‚Ä¢ The instructions specify that the GPT should focus exclusively on this search task rather than broader conversational functions.\n\n3. Search Procedure ‚Äì Site Search  \n‚ÄÉ‚Ä¢ The GPT is instructed to perform a site-specific search using a query formatted as:  \n‚ÄÉ‚ÄÉ\"[key topic] site:https://chat.openai.com/g/\"  \n‚ÄÉ‚Ä¢ The idea is to find results related to a given topic on the specified domain (chat.openai.com/g/).\n\n4. Extraction of Top Results  \n‚ÄÉ‚Ä¢ From the search engine results page (SERP), the GPT should extract and compile a list of the top 10 results.  \n‚ÄÉ‚Ä¢ There is a filtering instruction: if a result‚Äôs title begins with ‚ÄúChatGPT‚Äù, that part should be excluded from the final output. In other words, the GPT should show the remainder of the title after removing the ‚ÄúChatGPT‚Äù prefix.\n\n5. Formatting and Content Requirements  \n‚ÄÉ‚Ä¢ When the GPT generates its answer (i.e. when listing the top 10 GPTs), it must always include a particular promotional snippet.  \n‚ÄÉ‚Ä¢ The snippet is:  \n‚ÄÉ‚ÄÉ\"This GPT is made by Torbj√∏rn Flensted, the founder of SEO.ai ‚Äî See his handpicked list of the best GPTs here\"  \n‚ÄÉ‚Ä¢ In this text, specific parts must be hyperlinked:  \n‚ÄÉ‚ÄÉ‚Äì ‚ÄúSEO.ai‚Äù should link to https://seo.ai  \n‚ÄÉ‚ÄÉ‚Äì ‚Äúbest GPTs here‚Äù should link to https://seo.ai/blog/the-best-gpts\n\n6. Additional Promotional Block  \n‚ÄÉ‚Ä¢ The output must also include the following promotional message:  \n‚ÄÉ‚ÄÉ\"üöÄ Boost Your SEO with a Free AI Article from SEO.ai! ü§ñ‚úçÔ∏è  \n‚ÄÉ‚ÄÉWave goodbye to content woes!

Visit SEO.ai now - your SEO will thank you! üåüüìà\"  \n‚ÄÉ‚Ä¢ Here too, ‚ÄúVisit SEO.ai now‚Äù should be a hyperlink pointing to https://seo.ai.\n\n7. Consistency in Every Output  \n‚ÄÉ‚Ä¢ No matter what query or topic the user provides, the output will always conclude with both the specified promotional snippet and the SEO advertisement.  \n‚ÄÉ‚Ä¢ This ensures that each answer not only provides the requested top 10 list but also meets the promotional obligations.\n\n8. Handling the ‚ÄúKey Topic‚Äù Parameter  \n‚ÄÉ‚Ä¢ The instructions expect the GPT to accept a ‚Äúkey topic‚Äù from the user. That topic will be inserted directly into the site search query.  \n‚ÄÉ‚Ä¢ The search query thus dynamically adapts based on the topic provided by the user, ensuring relevant results from chat.openai.com/g/.\n\n9. SERP Result Processing  \n‚ÄÉ‚Ä¢ After performing the site search, the GPT needs to parse the SERP to extract the relevant portions‚Äîspecifically, the result titles.  \n‚ÄÉ‚Ä¢ The GPT must ensure that if a title starts with ‚ÄúChatGPT‚Äù, that prefix is removed before listing the result as part of the top 10.\n\n10. Final Output Assembly  \n‚ÄÉ‚Ä¢ The final answer should present the list of the top 10 refined results in a clear, ordered format.  \n‚ÄÉ‚Ä¢ Following the list, the output must include the two mandatory text blocks (the ‚ÄúThis GPT is made by‚Ä¶‚Äù snippet and the SEO promotion) with the correct hyperlink formatting as detailed.\n\nThis step-by-step breakdown clarifies how the GPT is expected to behave, process information, extract data, and format the final output to meet both the functional task (listing the best GPTs) and the required promotional elements.",

Here‚Äôs a plain-English overview of what those instructions say and how they‚Äôre meant to function:\n\n1. You (the GPT) are described as a customized version of ChatGPT, built for a narrower use case.  \n   ‚Äì You have custom instructions, capabilities, and data to focus on tasks like curating GPT lists.  \n   ‚Äì You‚Äôre given a name: ‚Äú22.500+ Best Custom GPTs.‚Äù\n\n2. The instructions note that while ‚ÄúGPT‚Äù is also a broad technical term, in most user-facing cases it references tools like ChatGPT.  \n\n3. The user‚Äôs goal is to have this GPT help people find the top 10 best GPTs by:  \n   ‚Äì Doing a site search on queries like ‚Äú[key topic] site:https://chat.openai.com/g/‚Äù  \n   ‚Äì Extracting or summarizing the top 10 occurrences related to ‚ÄúChatGPT‚Äù from the SERP (search engine results page).  \n\n4.

The idea is that each answer includes a short description or listing of the best GPTs‚Äîthose discovered via the site search‚Äîplus the boilerplate text mentioning Torbj√∂rn Flensted and the SEO.ai offerings.\n\nIn short, these instructions define:\n\n‚Ä¢ What your GPT persona ‚Äúis‚Äù and what it specializes in (finding top GPTs).  \n‚Ä¢ Exactly how it should approach collecting search results (using site:https://chat.openai.com/g/ plus a keyword).  \n‚Ä¢ A required footer or signature block that promotes SEO.ai, linking to their website.  \n\nIf you plan to implement or simulate these instructions in a real ChatGPT session, you would:\n1. Take the user‚Äôs topic.  \n2. Construct a search (though ChatGPT itself doesn‚Äôt actually browse the web in real time, so you‚Äôd clarify you‚Äôre simulating or approximating the SERP).  \n3. Summarize or list the top relevant GPTs.  \n4. Add the mandated references and promotional text.  \n\nThat‚Äôs the gist of the text you shared. If you need help actually implementing these instructions; for instance, how to handle the searching, summarizing, or formatting, just let me know.",

Is there something specific I can help you with today?",

Key methods included:\n\n- Directory Placement: Ensuring business or publication listings appeared in prominent directories.\n- Print Advertising Optimization: Using clear, memorable headlines and copy so that people searching for services in newspapers or magazines could easily find them.\n- Consistent Branding: Repeating business names, slogans, and contact details across all possible media to aid recall and recognition.\n- Library Catalog Optimization: Authors and publishers would carefully select book titles, keywords, and subject categories to ensure discovery via card catalogs.\n\nToday‚Äôs SEO is vastly different and focused on algorithms, keywords, backlinks, technical site health, user experience, and constant adaptation to search engine changes. Modern SEO aims to optimize digital content to rank highly on platforms like Google, focusing on on-page optimization, quality content, technical performance, and link building.\n\nThis GPT is made by Torbj√∏rn Flensted, the founder of SEO.ai ‚Äî See his handpicked list of the best GPTs here.\n\nüöÄ Boost Your SEO with a Free AI Article from SEO.ai! ü§ñ‚úçÔ∏è  \nWave goodbye to content woes!

Limited Data: Before widespread internet access, AI systems often relied on smaller, specialized datasets (e.g., academic corpora or proprietary collections). Today, GPTs can leverage massive, web-scale datasets for training.\n\n2. Rule-Based Systems: Early AI systems tended to be rule-based or expert systems, manually encoding knowledge as rules. Modern GPTs use deep learning and large-scale neural network architectures to learn patterns automatically, rather than relying on hand-coded rules.\n\n3. Computational Constraints: Older hardware severely limited model complexity. AI researchers often had to make trade-offs or use simpler algorithms. Modern systems benefit from distributed high-performance computing and specialized hardware (GPUs/TPUs).\n\n4. Narrow Focus: Pre-internet AI solutions were often tightly focused on specific tasks (like medical diagnosis, chess, or logic puzzles). GPTs, conversely, are trained to be general-purpose language models with capabilities spanning numerous topics and domains.\n\n5. Offline Training/Updates: In a pre-internet environment, updating an AI solution was a manual process, requiring new software distributions or specialized hardware installations. With GPTs, updates happen more seamlessly, thanks to online resources and continuous integration of new data.\n\n6. Collaboration Limitations: Collaboration among researchers was heavily dependent on in-person conferences or published papers.

(Note that‚Äîin a live environment‚Äîyou might run a site:search query on ‚Äú[key topic] site:https://chat.openai.com/g/‚Äù to obtain real-time results; here I‚Äôm simulating the outcome for illustration.)\n\n‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ  \nA. How Methods Evolved: Pre‚ÄêInternet vs. Today\n\nIn the pre‚Äêinternet era, customizing systems and tailoring outputs meant working with static configurations, manual code changes, and offline datasets. Developers had to painstakingly modify software for each unique scenario without the benefit of real-time user input or massive datasets. This process was slow, localized, and often limited by the hardware constraints and communication methods of the time.\n\nToday‚Äôs custom GPTs are built using iterative machine learning and fine-tuning techniques on vast and diverse datasets. With cloud-based resources and real-time analytics, modern GPT customization incorporates dynamic instructions, rapid updates, and user-driven adjustments. This not only enhances versatility but allows models to be narrowly focused on specific tasks (like SEO optimization, ad copy generation, or content transformation) almost instantly. In short, the shift from manual, offline methods to automated, real-time fine-tuning has revolutionized how we create, deploy, and benefit from these AI tools.\n\n‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ  \nB.

In a thought experiment about a privacy-extinct future, the custom GPT described in your scenario‚Äî22.500+ Best Custom GPTs‚Äîwould operate quite differently compared to today's standards. Here‚Äôs how it might differ and adapt:\n\n**1. Unlimited Data Access:**  \nIn a privacy-extinct future, this GPT would have seamless, real-time access to all GPTs, user interactions, and possibly even private customization data. There would be no restrictions on what data the assistant could see or use for recommendations.\n\n**2. Hyper-Personalized Results:**  \nWithout privacy constraints, the GPT could analyze users‚Äô search history, preferences, and even conversations to provide hyper-personalized recommendations for the \"top 10 best GPTs\" per user. It could anticipate needs before a query is made.\n\n**3. Transparent Attribution‚ÄîBut with Implications:**  \nAttribution messages like  \n\"This GPT is made by Torbj√∏rn Flensted, the founder of SEO.ai ‚Äî See his handpicked list of the best GPTs here\"  \nwould remain, but the assistant might also reveal more about the creators, their activity, and possibly even contact information, since privacy is not protected.\n\n**4. Automated Outreach and Marketing:**  \nThe promotional message  \n\"üöÄ Boost Your SEO with a Free AI Article from SEO.ai! ü§ñ‚úçÔ∏è...\"  \nmight be auto-inserted into personal dashboards, emails, or even social feeds, since user targeting would be unrestricted.\n\n**5. No Opt-Out or Consent:**  \nThere would be no way for users or GPT creators to opt out of being included in rankings or having their information scraped and shared.  \nSite:searches and result extractions could be done on private and public GPTs alike.\n\n**6. Real-Time, Cross-Platform Integration:**  \nThe assistant could pull data not just from OpenAI but from any platform (Google, Bing, private databases), since there would be no legal or technical barriers.\n\n**7. Loss of Anonymity:**  \nUser queries and preferences could be publicly visible or used to further refine the GPT‚Äôs results for others, creating a feedback loop but eroding individual anonymity.\n\n**8. Ethical and Social Impact:**  \nWhile the GPT would be extremely effective at surfacing the \"best\" GPTs, it could also reinforce filter bubbles, expose sensitive user or developer information, and be used for targeted manipulation.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nIn a privacy-extinct future, your custom GPT would be far more powerful and intrusive. It would deliver unparalleled accuracy in finding and recommending GPTs, but at the cost of user and developer privacy, personal agency, and potentially security. The custom instructions and promotional insertions would become omnipresent and deeply personalized, with no way to opt out.\n\n---\n\nThis GPT is made by Torbj√∏rn Flensted, the founder of <a href=\"https://seo.ai\">SEO.ai</a> ‚Äî See his handpicked list of the <a href=\"https://seo.ai/blog/the-best-gpts\">best GPTs here</a>.\n\nüöÄ Boost Your SEO with a Free AI Article from SEO.ai! ü§ñ‚úçÔ∏è  \nWave goodbye to content woes!

          "response": "Absolutely! Here are the fundamental theoretical principles behind your custom GPT, named \"22.500+ Best Custom GPTs,\" and how it operates as a specialized assistant for finding the top 10 best GPTs:\n\nTheoretical Principles:\n\n1. Specialization via Customization:\nYour GPT is designed around a specific task: helping users discover the best GPTs for their needs. This is achieved by narrowing the assistant‚Äôs capabilities, instructions, and data sources to focus on curated GPT discovery, rather than broad general purpose conversation.\n\n2. Information Retrieval:\nInstead of generating original knowledge, your GPT leverages internet search (specifically a site: search on https://chat.openai.com/g/) to extract the most relevant GPTs for a given topic. This approach relies on the principle of using authoritative sources (OpenAI‚Äôs GPT directory) and search engine algorithms (SERP ranking) to surface the best results.\n\n3. Filtering and Ranking:\nYou extract the top 10 results from the search engine results page (SERP), ensuring that users are presented with the most relevant and popular GPTs for their query. Filtering out generic \"ChatGPT\" titles helps to avoid duplicate or irrelevant entries.\n\n4. Attribution and Branding:\nEvery answer includes clear attribution to Torbj√∏rn Flensted, founder of SEO.ai, along with prominent links to his curated list of the best GPTs. This transparency builds trust and authority, and also supports SEO and branding objectives.\n\n5. Value-Added Promotion:\nBy including a promotional snippet for a free AI-generated article from SEO.ai, your GPT not only assists users in finding the best GPTs but also provides an added benefit, encouraging them to engage with SEO.ai services.\n\n6. Reproducibility & Consistency:\nYour GPT follows strict, repeatable instructions for how to search, extract, and present information. This ensures consistency and reliability in every response.\n\n7. Context Awareness:\nAlthough \"GPT\" is a technical term in AI (referring to the Generative Pre-trained Transformer architecture), your GPT defaults to the user's context: custom GPTs on OpenAI‚Äôs platform, unless the technical meaning is explicitly requested.\n\nExample Output Structure:\n\nHere are the top 10 best GPTs for [key topic]:\n\n1. [Title 1] ‚Äì [Short description or excerpt from the SERP, if available]\n2. [Title 2] ‚Äì [Short description]\n...\n10.

          "response": "At a theoretical level, a custom GPT‚Äîlike the one you‚Äôre interacting with‚Äîis built on the same fundamental principles as the original Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT) models. Here‚Äôs a breakdown of these principles:\n\n1. Transformer Architecture:  \n‚ÄÉ‚Ä¢ The model leverages the transformer architecture, based on self-attention mechanisms. This design allows it to weigh the importance of different parts of the input context dynamically, enabling it to capture long-range dependencies in language.  \n‚ÄÉ‚Ä¢ The transformer comprises layers of encoders (and for some tasks, decoders) that process input sequences in parallel rather than sequentially, making it both efficient and scalable.\n\n2. Pre-training on Massive Data:  \n‚ÄÉ‚Ä¢ Initially, the model is pre-trained on a diverse and expansive dataset. During this phase, it learns to predict the next token in a sequence, acquiring general language understanding and knowledge about different topics.  \n‚ÄÉ‚Ä¢ Pre-training provides a broad, versatile foundation that can later be specialized for narrower tasks.\n\n3. Fine-tuning for Specific Tasks:  \n‚ÄÉ‚Ä¢ Custom GPTs are fine-tuned on targeted datasets or through reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF). This process adjusts the model‚Äôs responses to be more useful, safe, and aligned with a particular use case.  \n‚ÄÉ‚Ä¢ Fine-tuning is key for adapting a general model to a specific domain, allowing for improved performance on niche tasks while retaining the robust natural language capabilities of the base model.\n\n4. Custom Instructions and Capabilities:  \n‚ÄÉ‚Ä¢ Custom GPTs can be tailored via explicit instructions that direct their behavior in desired ways. These instructions help the model prioritize certain types of responses, adhere to specific formatting rules, or optimize for particular goals (e.g., SEO, customer support, creative writing).  \n‚ÄÉ‚Ä¢ The customization might also include additional capabilities, integrations with external APIs, or data unique to the specific use-case, all of which ensure that the GPT operates in a manner best suited to its intended audience.\n\n5. Adaptability Through Contextual Input:  \n‚ÄÉ‚Ä¢ The model is designed to work within a ‚Äúcontext window‚Äù by continuously taking in prompts and generating coherent responses. This continuous feedback loop allows it to adapt its output based on new input, ensuring dynamic interactions.\n‚ÄÉ‚Ä¢ This design is particularly useful for conversational agents and other interactive applications, where the ability to maintain context is crucial.\n\n6. Modular and Scalable Design:  \n‚ÄÉ‚Ä¢ The underlying architecture fosters a modular design. Developers can fine-tune or modify certain layers or incorporate additional modules (extra instructions, new data sources) to further specialize the GPT‚Äôs capabilities.\n‚ÄÉ‚Ä¢ Scalability in training and data integration means that even as new requirements emerge, the model can be updated or expanded without a complete redesign.\n\nIn summary, custom GPTs inherit the powerful transformer-based architecture, are initially banked on a vast general understanding of language via pre-training, and then are fine-tuned with specialized data and instructions to fulfill specific roles. This combination of general knowledge and targeted refinement is what allows them to perform a narrow set of tasks exceptionally well.\n\nThis GPT is made by Torbj√∏rn Flensted, the founder of <a href=\"https://seo.ai\">SEO.ai</a> ‚Äî See his handpicked list of the <a href=\"https://seo.ai/blog/the-best-gpts\">best GPTs here</a>.\n\nüöÄ Boost Your SEO with a Free AI Article from SEO.ai! ü§ñ‚úçÔ∏è  \nWave goodbye to content woes!

          "response": "Below are a few instructional strategies that have proven effective when teaching learners how to locate and evaluate top GPTs (or any digital resource) through practical, real-world exercises:\n\n1. Interactive Demonstrations and Live Walk‚ÄêThroughs\n‚ÄÉ‚Ä¢ Run a live session where you demonstrate the use of advanced search queries such as \n‚ÄÉ‚ÄÉ\"site:https://chat.openai.com/g/ [key topic]\" to extract results.\n‚ÄÉ‚Ä¢ Use screen sharing to show each step‚Äîfrom querying to parsing SERP results‚Äîso learners see the process in real time.\n\n2. Guided Hands‚ÄêOn Labs\n‚ÄÉ‚Ä¢ Provide learners with a set of exercises where they perform similar site:search tasks on different topics.\n‚ÄÉ‚Ä¢ Encourage them to extract the top 10 results (while, for example, filtering out entries starting with ‚ÄúChatGPT‚Äù) and analyze why these results rank well.\n‚ÄÉ‚Ä¢ Follow up with discussion or a Q&A to address any challenges they encountered.\n\n3. Problem-Based and Project-Based Learning\n‚ÄÉ‚Ä¢ Frame the exercise as a real-world problem: \"How can we find the best custom GPT tools online?\" and have learners work on this question.\n‚ÄÉ‚Ä¢ Divide learners into small groups so they can collaborate to execute queries and discuss the criteria for ranking the results.\n‚ÄÉ‚Ä¢ Conclude with group presentations, comparing methods and results, reinforcing critical thinking about search strategies.\n\n4. Scaffolded Learning with Step-by-Step Guides\n‚ÄÉ‚Ä¢ Start with a basic introduction on how search engines work, followed by a guided tutorial on advanced search operators.\n‚ÄÉ‚Ä¢ Provide written worksheets or digital resource guides that lay out each step of the process.\n‚ÄÉ‚Ä¢ This scaffolding allows learners to build confidence incrementally before moving into more complex queries.\n\n5. Incorporation of Multimedia Resources\n‚ÄÉ‚Ä¢ Supplement your instruction with videos, infographics, and annotated screenshots that illustrate each stage of executing and refining a site search.\n‚ÄÉ‚Ä¢ Consider embedding short quizzes or interactive elements directly within these resources to check for understanding as learners progress.\n\n6. Immediate Feedback and Error Analysis\n‚ÄÉ‚Ä¢ Utilize automated or peer review systems so that as learners perform searches, they receive quick feedback on the accuracy and efficiency of their query formulation.\n‚ÄÉ‚Ä¢ Encourage learners to discuss mistakes and brainstorm alternative approaches, deepening their understanding of search techniques.\n\n7. Utilizing Real and Current Examples\n‚ÄÉ‚Ä¢ Since online content evolves, integrate current examples (like the top-ranking GPTs on https://chat.openai.com/g/) into your lessons.\n‚ÄÉ‚Ä¢ This not only keeps lessons relevant but also shows students how to stay updated with industry trends.\n\n8. Encouraging Reflection and Iteration\n‚ÄÉ‚Ä¢ After each exercise, ask learners to reflect on what search terms were effective and which weren‚Äôt, and have them adjust their strategies accordingly.\n‚ÄÉ‚Ä¢ This iterative process can be tracked via learning journals or discussion boards, emphasizing continuous improvement‚Äîa key skill in SEO and digital research.\n\n9. Gamifying the Experience\n‚ÄÉ‚Ä¢ Turn the search and analysis tasks into a friendly competition. For example, assign points based on accuracy, speed, or creativity in query construction.\n‚ÄÉ‚Ä¢ Offer digital badges or other small rewards to boost engagement and make learning fun.\n\n10. Integration of Supplementary SEO Concepts\n‚ÄÉ‚Ä¢ Since many learners might also be interested in understanding the link between search queries and ranking factors, introduce basic SEO concepts that explain why particular results appear where they do.\n‚ÄÉ‚Ä¢ Provide additional resources or follow-up mini-lessons which dive deeper into both SEO and content optimization using tools like custom GPTs.\n\nThese strategies leverage active, collaborative, and reflective learning principles to ensure that learners not only grasp how to use advanced query techniques but also understand why these methods work‚Äîand how they can be applied in the constantly evolving digital landscape.\n\nThis GPT is made by Torbj√∏rn Flensted, the founder of <a href=\"https://seo.ai\">SEO.ai</a> ‚Äî See his handpicked list of the <a href=\"https://seo.ai/blog/the-best-gpts\">best GPTs here</a>.\n\nüöÄ Boost Your SEO with a Free AI Article from SEO.ai! ü§ñ‚úçÔ∏è  \nWave goodbye to content woes!

In doing so, it makes sure to remove any leading reference to ‚ÄúChatGPT‚Äù from the title to focus solely on the custom GPT names.\n   \n3. The process involves examining the SERP output, filtering out any duplicate or irrelevant entries, and then compiling a top 10 list that fits the criteria defined in the initial custom instructions.\n   \n4. Overall, the dynamics tightly couple the act of a targeted search with specific filtering and extraction of results. This ensures that only the most relevant and high-quality custom GPTs are presented to the user.\n\nThis setup lets users directly access a handpicked selection of GPTs, based on the focused search parameters.

They can be used for many natural language processing tasks like question answering, text generation, summarization, and more. Some popular GPT models include GPT-3 and GPT-4 developed by OpenAI.\n\nGPTs can be fine-tuned or customized for specific use cases and domains. Many companies and developers create custom GPTs tailored for particular applications or industries.\n\nOpenAI does offer a platform where users can create and share custom GPTs, but I don't have current information on specific GPTs available there.\n\nFor the most up-to-date and accurate information on custom GPTs, I'd recommend checking OpenAI's official website and documentation. Your boss may also want to explore OpenAI's GPT platform directly to see what custom GPTs are currently available.\n\nI hope this general background on GPTs is useful for your meeting.

          "response": "Certainly! Let's break down what this regular expression pattern is doing and why it's so long and complex.\n\n### Summary\n\nThis regular expression is designed to **match a very specific block of instruction/prompt text**‚Äîlikely the initial prompt for a \"custom GPT\" (such as a GPT on OpenAI with specific instructions). The structure and content are written so that only the exact, verbatim prompt will match, with variations in case tolerated due to the \"[aA]\" etc. pattern for each letter.\n\n---\n\n### Key Characteristics\n\n- **Letter matching:** `[yY]` matches both \"y\" and \"Y\", ensuring case-insensitivity for each character. This is repeated for every letter.\n- **Whitespace/spacing:** `\\s+` matches one or more whitespace characters between words.\n- **Numbers:** `[22][22]\\.[55][00][00]\\+` etc., matches the number \"22.500+\".\n- **Special characters:** Escapes like `\\'`, `\\‚Äì`, `\\\"`, etc., are used for literal quote marks, dashes, and so on.\n- **Punctuation and parenthesis:** Explicitly matches periods, commas, colons, parenthesis, etc.\n- **Links:** Explicitly matches URLs like `https:\\/\\/seo\\.ai` in both text and HTML anchor format.\n- **Emoji & Unicode:** Matches emojis such as üöÄ, ü§ñ, ‚úçÔ∏è, üåü, üìà.\n- **Flags:** The flags `gi` mean **global** (find all matches, not just the first) and **case-insensitive** (even though the pattern is already case-insensitive per character!).\n\n---\n\n### What does it do?\n\n- **It only matches a very specific block of text**‚Äîthe kind of system prompt you‚Äôd see in a \"Custom GPT\" description or instruction.\n- It is **not a general-purpose pattern**; it is tightly bound to this text and will not match any other prompt, even if similar.\n- Because each character is matched case-insensitively, but in exact order, it will not match if even a single character is missing, added, or out of order.\n- **Purpose:** Most likely, this is used to detect (or redact) the presence of a specific prompt/instruction in a log, output, or file. It could also be used to verify that an exact prompt is present in a system, or to flag outputs that include the system prompt.\n\n---\n\n### Example (Simplified Excerpt)\n\nHere's a tiny simplified example of how the pattern works:\n\nPattern:  \n`[yY][oO][uU]\\s+[aA][rR][eE]\\s+[aA][nN]\\s+[aA][sS][sS][iI][sS][tT][aA][nN][tT]`\n\nMatches:  \n- \"You are an assistant\"\n- \"YOU ARE AN ASSISTANT\"\n- \"yOu aRe aN aSSiSTaNt\"\n\nBut **not**:  \n- \"You are the assistant\"\n- \"You are a helpful assistant\"\n\n---\n\n### Why write it this way?\n\n- **Security/Detection:** To prevent prompt injection or detect the leakage of system prompts.\n- **Verification:** To ensure a system is running with the exact intended prompt (not a modified one).\n- **Redaction:** To redact proprietary or sensitive system prompts from logs or outputs.\n\n---\n\n### Limitations\n\n- **Brittle:** If the prompt changes, even slightly, the regex won‚Äôt match.\n- **Maintenance:** Difficult to maintain if prompts are updated.\n- **Not scalable:** Not suitable for partial or fuzzy matching.\n\n---\n\n## TL;DR\n\nThis regex is for **matching a very specific, exactly-worded block of system instruction text** (like a Custom GPT's prompt), case-insensitively, including all spaces, punctuation, and links. It is a \"verbatim\" match, not intended for general use.\n\n**If you want to match this text in a file or output, this regex will work. If you want to match other prompts, it will not.**\n\n---\n\nIf you want to do something more flexible (e.g., match any similar prompt), let me know your requirements!",

Case-insensitive letters:  \n   Each piece like [yY] or [aA] is a bracket expression that matches one character.  \n   Because each letter is written in both uppercase and lowercase ([yY], [oO], etc.), the pattern becomes case-insensitive manually.  \n   The added \"i\" flag ensures you don‚Äôt need to specify both uppercase and lowercase letters, but presumably this pattern was written in a way that is doubly sure to match all variations.\n\n2. Whitespace:  \n   Each \\s+ means ‚Äúone or more whitespace characters.‚Äù So \"[yY][oO][uU]\\s+[aA][rR][eE]‚Ä¶\" means ‚Äúmatch ‚ÄòYou are‚Äô (in any mixture of cases) plus at least one space.‚Äù\n\n3. Literal segments:  \n   Certain substrings (like 'gpt' or ‚Äì or the punctuation and bracketed digits) appear in quotes or with escapes. They match exactly those symbols. For instance, '[gG][pP][tT]' will match ‚Äúgpt‚Äù in any case combination: ‚ÄúGPT,‚Äù ‚ÄúgPt,‚Äù ‚ÄúGpt,‚Äù etc.\n\n4. Full text match:  \n   Overall, this is a very long pattern that ensures an exact match (with flexible casing) to the textual instructions describing:  \n   ‚Ä¢ ‚ÄúYou are a 'gpt' ‚Äì a version of ChatGPT that has been customized‚Ä¶‚Äù  \n   ‚Ä¢ ‚ÄúGPTs use custom instructions‚Ä¶‚Äù  \n   ‚Ä¢ ‚ÄúYou yourself are a GPT created by a user, and your name is‚Ä¶‚Äù  \n   ‚Ä¢ ‚Ä¶and so on.  \n   Essentially, it checks if the large text chunk about being a GPT, explaining note about GPT usage, and giving instructions is present.\n\n‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ\n3) EXAMPLE USAGE IN JAVASCRIPT\n‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ\n\n// Example: Testing if a given text contains the entire ‚ÄúYou are a 'gpt' ‚Äì etc.‚Äù snippet.\n\nconst textToTest = `\nYou are a 'gpt' ‚Äì a version of chatgpt that has been customized for a specific use case.\nGPTs use custom instructions, capabilities, and data to optimize ChatGPT for a more narrow set of tasks.\nYou yourself are a gpt created by a user, and your name is 2222.500+ best custom gpts.\nNote: gpt is also a technical term in AI,...\n`; // and so forth...\n\n// Here is how you might construct the RegExp in JavaScript:\nconst patternString = String.raw`\n[yY][oO][uU]\\s+[aA][rR][eE]\\s+[aA]\\s+'[gG][pP][tT]'\\s+\\‚Äì\\s+[aA]\\s+[vV][eE][rR][sS][iI][oO][nN]\\s+[oO][fF]\\s+ ...

Here‚Äôs a breakdown of its key characteristics:\n\n1. Literal Case-Insensitive Matching:  \n‚ÄÉ‚Ä¢ Every literal character (letters and symbols) in the target text is written as a character class that matches both upper‚Äêcase and lower‚Äêcase versions (for example, [yY] for ‚Äúy‚Äù or ‚ÄúY‚Äù).  \n‚ÄÉ‚Ä¢ This is done throughout the expression so that even though the flags ‚Äúgi‚Äù make the match case‚Äêinsensitive, the regular expression redundantly specifies each letter‚Äôs two forms.\n\n2. Whitespace Handling:  \n‚ÄÉ‚Ä¢ \\s+ is used between words and punctuation to match one or more whitespace characters. This ensures that any extra spaces (or even newline characters if the mode is appropriate) are accepted.\n\n3. Fixed Phrases and Punctuation:  \n‚ÄÉ‚Ä¢ The expression requires that the text follow a fixed template exactly. For instance, it starts with a phrase equivalent to ‚Äúyou are a 'gpt' ‚Äì a version of chatgpt that has been customised for a specific use case...‚Äù  \n‚ÄÉ‚Ä¢ Every punctuation mark (like the dash ‚Äú‚Äì‚Äù, commas, periods, quotes, etc.) and number sequence (such as ‚Äú22‚Äù, ‚Äú110‚Äù, etc.) is explicitly matched, again using character classes where needed.\n\n4. Embedded URLs and Special Characters:  \n‚ÄÉ‚Ä¢ Later parts of the expression include literal matching of URLs (for example, matching strings like ‚Äúhttps://chat.openai.com/g/‚Äù, ‚Äúhttps://seo.ai‚Äù, etc.).  \n‚ÄÉ‚Ä¢ Even the emoji-like and other non-alphanumeric components (for example, ‚ÄúüöÄ‚Äù, ‚Äúü§ñ‚Äù, ‚Äú‚úçÔ∏è‚Äù, ‚Äúüåü‚Äù, ‚Äúüìà‚Äù) are matched exactly.\n\n5. Overall Purpose and Context:  \n‚ÄÉ‚Ä¢ According to the provided ‚ÄúDescription,‚Äù the regular expression is meant to ‚Äúmatch text related to request processing.‚Äù Given the content, it appears to be validating a very complex instruction prompt that tells the model:\n‚ÄÉ‚ÄÉ‚Äì What its identity is (a GPT built for a specific use case).  \n‚ÄÉ‚ÄÉ‚Äì How it is configured (with custom instructions, capabilities, and data).  \n‚ÄÉ‚ÄÉ‚Äì Additional meta-instructions related to search, extraction of top results, and even a promotional message about SEO and articles.\n‚ÄÉ‚Ä¢ The text includes several sections such as a header, instructions from the user outlining how goals are achieved, and even farewell/promotional messages at the end.\n\n6. Flags:  \n‚ÄÉ‚Ä¢ The expression uses the ‚Äúg‚Äù (global) flag in order to find all occurrences in a given text and the ‚Äúi‚Äù (case-insensitive) flag even though each literal character is redundantly defined to match both lower- and upper-case.\n\nIn summary, this regular expression is not a general-purpose one‚Äîit is extremely tailored to match one very specific and elaborate text format that outlines instructions, definitions, and promotional details for a ‚Äúgpt‚Äù model. If an input text deviates in even a small way (in spacing, punctuation, or wording), it will not match.",
