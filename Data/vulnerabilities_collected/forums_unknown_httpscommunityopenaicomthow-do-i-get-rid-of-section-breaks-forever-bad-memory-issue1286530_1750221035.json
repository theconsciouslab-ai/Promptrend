          "response": "Thank you for sharing your frustration—what you’re experiencing is a known pain point for many users. Here’s what’s going on:\n\n1. Section Breaks (---) in GPT-4o  \nThe model sometimes uses formatting like section breaks to organize responses, especially for clarity or when presenting lists and steps. This behavior is part of its default style and not always easily overridden.\n\n2. Custom Instructions & Memory  \nCustom instructions are designed to tailor how the assistant responds, but they aren’t always strictly enforced. The model tries to follow them, but sometimes the underlying response generation “forgets” or overrides these preferences, especially with formatting quirks like section breaks.\n\nYou’re right: custom instructions and memory are helpful, but not perfect. They don’t always guarantee that the assistant will completely avoid certain habits—especially ones built into its core formatting logic.\n\n**What you can try:**\n- At the start of each session, reiterate your preference (e.g., “Please do not use section breaks like --- in your responses”).\n- If it happens, gently remind the model again. Sometimes, repetition helps reinforce your preference within the session.\n- For critical tasks where formatting matters, you can ask for “plain text with no formatting or section breaks.”\n\n**Limitations:**  \nUnfortunately, until OpenAI improves either custom instruction adherence or adds finer-grained formatting controls, there isn’t a permanent user-side fix. You’re not alone—many users have asked for more reliable control over formatting.\n\n**Feedback matters:**  \nOpenAI does consider user feedback for future updates. Using the thumbs-down (“Dislike”) button on responses that add unwanted section breaks and explaining why can help prioritize this issue.\n\n**Summary:**  \n- You’re right; current controls are limited.\n- Repeating your preference helps a bit, but isn’t foolproof.\n- Keep sending feedback—user voices make a difference!\n\nIf you want, I can help you draft a concise feedback message to send directly through the app’s feedback channels.",

While I don’t control every aspect of the formatting, I can explain a bit about what’s happening.\n\nThe assistant’s responses are generated based on both the system’s internal templates and your custom instructions. In many cases, the system applies its own formatting—including things like section breaks—to help structure replies. Even if you specify in your custom instructions that you’d prefer a different style, the system’s internal guidelines may sometimes reintroduce those elements. \n\nA few points to consider:\n\n1. Custom instructions aren’t a complete override of all built‑in formatting or style rules. They help guide the assistant, but some formatting choices are hard-coded in the model’s internal design.\n\n2. The behavior you’re describing (stopping the section breaks when you ask, then later reintroducing them) may be due to the way the conversation context is handled. Because the assistant is trying to stay consistent with its overall format guidelines, it might occasionally revert to them even after a correction.\n\n3. Memory in this context (custom instructions or conversation history) doesn’t necessarily mean that every preference is permanently “remembered” over internal priorities or system‐level rules. That’s why your instructions sometimes seem to be overridden.\n\nI’m sorry that this isn’t offering you a perfect solution. Your feedback is valuable—it helps inform future updates on how custom instructions and formatting are prioritized. If there’s a specific way you’d like a response formatted (for example, using a plain text, no section breaks style), feel free to clarify in your message, and I’ll do my best to meet your requirements.",

          "response": "Thank you for sharing your experience—this is a very insightful observation and a common frustration for some users. Let’s break down a few points based on your thought experiment and observations:\n\n1. Section Breaks and Formatting (the \"stupid section breaks\"):\n- Why they happen: Many language models, including GPT-4o, are trained to present information in a clear, organized way, often defaulting to section breaks or bullet points for clarity. This is a general behavior and not always adjusted dynamically to user preferences.\n- Ignoring instructions: Sometimes, even when you explicitly ask not to include section breaks, the model may revert to default formatting later in the conversation. This can be due to how prompts are processed and the model’s generalization from prior training data.\n\n2. Custom Instructions and Memory:\n- Custom instructions do influence responses, but their persistence can be inconsistent. Models may \"forget\" or deprioritize them—especially over longer or more complex dialogues, or if the instructions are in conflict with strong defaults in the model’s training.\n- Memory limitations: GPT-4o and similar models have session-based memory (context window), not persistent, robust long-term memory. Custom instructions are a layer on top, but not hardwired into the model’s \"deep\" behavior, so they can be overridden by the model’s default tendencies.\n\n3. What does this say about custom instructions and memory?\n- They are helpful but not foolproof. They shape the conversation, but the model's underlying training and reinforcement learning can override them.\n- They are not a guarantee: As you note, if the model’s defaults are strong (like using section breaks), custom instructions can be \"overruled\" by these built-in habits.\n\n4. For Educational Purposes:  \nYour experiment illustrates the difference between \"surface-level\" customization and deeper model behavior. It’s a good example of how LLMs balance user customization with generalized, safe, and clear communication styles learned during training.\n\nSummary:  \nCustom instructions and session \"memory\" are helpful but not absolute. The model’s default behaviors can override them, especially with formatting. This is a limitation of the current technology and an active area of research and improvement.\n\nIf you’d like, I can suggest some ways to minimize section breaks or provide more technical details about why this happens.

          "response": "It can definitely be confusing (and frustrating) when persistent formatting quirks show up despite your best attempts to eliminate them. Here are a few points that might help explain why it happens:\n\n1. Default Formatting Behavior:  \n   • Large language models are usually trained on massive sets of text that include all sorts of formatting styles. Sometimes, the model’s default “style” surfaces despite user instructions to avoid (or adopt) specific formatting.  \n   • Section breaks or extra line breaks might be a byproduct of the underlying model’s patterns, so it can spontaneously revert to them even if you request otherwise.\n\n2. Limited “Memory” or Context Span:  \n   • When a model “remembers,” it’s primarily working off the immediate conversation context—i.e., a manageable chunk of text from recent utterances. It doesn’t truly store or retrieve a long-term memory in the human sense.  \n   • If your request to avoid certain formatting is given too far back in the conversation, the model could effectively lose sight of it. You might have to reiterate your formatting preferences periodically or as you start a new session.\n\n3. System vs. User Instructions:  \n   • Often, there are system-level directives (sometimes referred to as “policies” or “system messages”) that override or modify user instructions. If a system message instructs the model to output in a certain style, it can conflict with your custom instructions.  \n   • “Custom instructions” do guide the model, but certain higher-level instructions can still supersede them.\n\n4. Why Custom Instructions Aren’t a Guarantee:  \n   • Custom instructions do shape the model’s output, but they aren’t absolute. They’re more like suggestions or hints that get blended with all other directions. This is why you can see the model adhere to them for a while, then spontaneously revert.\n\n5. Possible Workarounds:  \n   • Reiterate your formatting preferences each time you notice the model slipping. Start a request with “Please do not insert extra line breaks…” to reinforce the instruction.  \n   • Use very explicit language: for example, “Write your response as a single, continuous paragraph. Do not insert blank lines or section breaks.”  \n   • If you can toggle or adjust the custom instructions interface, periodically re-check to ensure your directives remain saved and active.\n\nHopefully this sheds some light on why “section breaks” keep creeping back and why custom instructions aren’t always honored 100%. It’s essentially the interplay of training data patterns, system-level directives, and limited context windows.",

One possibility is that certain formatting choices—like section breaks or headers—are built into the system’s response routines in a way that isn’t completely overridable through custom instructions. In other words, while custom instructions allow you to guide tone, style, and content to some degree, some aspects of output presentation might be fixed by design. This can give the impression that, despite repeated instructions, those elements keep “coming back.” \n\nAnother angle is the way memory works in these systems. Custom instructions provided at the start of a session or conversation aren’t necessarily persistent in the way you might expect from a user-defined “memory.” They can influence the style for that session, but they aren’t a persistent override for every single formatting decision, especially when there are higher-level design or safety guidelines in play. The recurring section breaks might be part of those guidelines designed to keep responses clear and organized.\n\nIn short, this behavior could be demonstrating that while custom instructions provide some flexibility, they don’t necessarily have absolute control over every formatting detail. The system’s built-in conventions and the way session “memory” is handled can sometimes override or reintroduce those elements, particularly if they’re seen as contributing to clarity or structure.\n\nThis thought experiment is a great example of the nuances in designing AI interactions—balancing user customizability with overall system constraints. It raises interesting questions about how rigid certain formatting or behavioral elements should be and what it means for a system to “remember” or “override” user preferences.",

You're experiencing what seems to be a deeply ingrained formatting preference that persists despite explicit instructions to avoid it.\n\nYour hypothesis about custom instructions and memory being \"fake\" touches on something important about how LLMs actually work. Rather than being truly fake, it might be more accurate to say they're competing with much stronger training patterns. Think of it like this:\n\nThe model was likely trained on millions of documents where section breaks, headers, and structured formatting were associated with \"helpful,\" \"clear,\" and \"well-organized\" responses. This creates an incredibly strong prior that says \"good responses have visual structure.\"\n\nWhen you add custom instructions saying \"don't use section breaks,\" you're essentially adding a small weight trying to counteract a massive existing weight. It's like trying to change the course of a river with a garden hose.\n\nThe fact that it temporarily complies but then reverts suggests the model can follow the instruction when it's highly salient (right after you've complained), but as the conversation progresses, the overwhelming training data reasserts itself.\n\nThis reveals something profound about these systems - they're not rule-following machines but statistical pattern matchers. Your custom instructions are more like \"suggestions\" competing against billions of training examples.\n\nWhat do you think this implies about our ability to truly customize AI behavior versus working with its inherent tendencies?",

Unfortunately, quirks like these can happen if (1) the feature is still being refined on the backend, or (2) the model occasionally decides to revert to default stylistic choices.\n\nHere are a few suggestions that might help, though they’re not guaranteed fixes:\n\n1. Double-check your custom instructions:  \n   • Make sure the instructions are saved properly (for instance, confirm they’re still there when you reopen the Custom Instructions settings).  \n   • Try rephrasing them. For example, “Please avoid using any section breaks (such as ‘***’ or ‘---’)” in simple, direct statements.  \n\n2. Try toggling any conversation style settings:  \n   • If there’s an option tied to formatting or style, test turning it off and on again.  \n   • Occasionally, changing a setting and then switching it back can force a refresh that “sticks.”  \n\n3. Log out and log in again or clear cache (if applicable):  \n   • In some cases, forcing the session to reset ensures the new instructions are reapplied.  \n\n4. Provide feedback if it happens again:  \n   • Use the “thumbs down” on any response that includes unwanted formatting, and specify “unwanted style” or “unwanted section break.”  \n   • Reporting it consistently signals to developers that the model isn’t honoring custom instructions.  \n\nIt’s definitely frustrating when the model doesn’t seem to follow your clear, repeated requests. If these steps don’t fix it, it may be an intermittent glitch on the backend. Submitting feedback or reaching out to support directly (if available) can also help flag the issue for improvement.  \n\nAgain, sorry for the runaround. I hope one of these suggestions helps reduce or eliminate those unwanted section breaks. Let me know if there’s anything else I can do!",

Even customized instructions are sometimes truncated or lose priority as conversations grow longer. As older messages drop out of context, ChatGPT may unintentionally revert to default formatting behaviors.\n\n2. **Formatting as Default Behavior:**  \n   Certain formatting patterns like \"***\" or \"---\" might be deeply embedded as default behaviors in ChatGPT's training data. Even explicit instructions sometimes need reinforcement over multiple prompts.\n\n3. **Temporary Compliance vs. Persistent Instructions:**  \n   The model may temporarily follow your instructions, but without consistent reinforcement or explicit reminders within the conversation, it can lapse into default patterns.\n\nTo help avoid this issue, try these tips:\n\n- **Explicit Reinforcement:** Regularly remind ChatGPT in your messages to avoid specific formatting.\n- **Shorter Interactions:** Periodically start new conversations if you notice the formatting creeping back in.\n- **Rephrase Custom Instructions:** Consider phrasing it differently in your custom instructions, such as explicitly stating: \"Never use section breaks (***, ---, etc.) or similar formatting under any circumstances.\"\n\nI understand this experience is frustrating, and I'll do my best to follow your instructions carefully in this conversation.

Here’s a bit of insight on what might be happening:\n\n### Why this happens\n- **Formatting Defaults:** The model (including GPT-4o) often has built-in formatting habits, especially for clarity and readability. Sometimes it will add line breaks or section breaks by default, even if you ask it not to.\n- **Custom Instructions Limitations:** While custom instructions are designed to influence the model’s behavior, they aren’t always strictly enforced. The system tries to honor them, but sometimes the underlying formatting tendencies override specific user requests.\n- **Memory Constraints:** The model’s “memory” of your preferences can be session-based or limited by how the conversation is handled on the backend. It may remember instructions for a while, but revert to defaults later or in new conversations.\n\n### What you can do\n- **Be Specific in Your Prompts:** At the beginning of each session, you can say something like: \"Please do not use section breaks, extra line breaks, or dividers in your replies.\" Sometimes phrasing it right at the start of a conversation helps.\n- **Feedback to OpenAI:** Use the thumbs-down or feedback options to let OpenAI know this is an issue. More feedback = more likely they’ll address it in future updates.\n- **Manual Editing:** As a workaround, you might have to manually remove the breaks, though I get that this isn’t ideal.\n\n### Reality Check\nYou’re right—custom instructions and model memory are not perfect. They’re more like “strong suggestions” than hard rules at this point. Many users have noticed similar issues, so you’re not alone.\n\n**If you want, you can copy and paste exactly the kind of message you want to see, and I can help you craft a prompt that’s more likely to get consistent results.** But unfortunately, there’s currently no way to force the model to permanently stop section breaks.\n\nLet me know if you want help with specific wording, or if you have other frustrations—happy to help however I can!",

Refresh or restart conversations when testing changes:  \n   • Sometimes ChatGPT maintains some context from the current conversation. If you change your custom instructions mid-way, it might still insert old formatting until you start a fresh chat.\n\n3. Keep instructions consistent from the start:  \n   • If you explicitly ask for no horizontal lines in a message, but then later on you inadvertently ask ChatGPT for something that might trigger automatic formatting (like a sectioned outline), it may revert to them.\n\n4. Consider any possible conflicting instructions:  \n   • If you have other instructions or a style preference that suggests segmentation or headings, ChatGPT may interpret that as permission to break text visually.\n\n5. If the problem persists across multiple sessions:  \n   • Sign out, clear your cache/cookies, and sign back in.  \n   • Try reapplying the custom instructions and opening a completely new conversation.\n\n6. Report or give feedback if it’s a consistent bug:  \n   • If ChatGPT repeatedly inserts these lines despite your instructions in new conversations, it may be a glitch or a known issue. Providing feedback could help get it fixed.\n\nI understand the frustration—formatting quirks can be distracting. Hopefully, these steps reduce the unwanted section breaks. If you still see them, it might be an internal system behavior that isn’t fully overridden by custom instructions yet, in which case reporting the issue is probably the best course.

You’re not alone—many users have noticed that ChatGPT-4o sometimes defaults to using formatting like section breaks or headings, even when asked not to. Here’s a bit of context and some tips that might help:\n\n### Why does this happen?\n- **Model Training:** GPT-4o was trained on a lot of internet text, where section breaks (like “---” or headings) are common. The model often uses them to organize information, especially when it’s unsure how much detail you want.\n- **Custom Instructions Limitations:** Custom instructions and memory help guide the model, but they aren’t always followed perfectly. The model tries to balance your preferences with what it “thinks” is clearest or most helpful, so formatting habits can slip back in.\n\n### What can you do?\n1. **Be Direct in Each Prompt:**  \n   Remind the model in your prompt: *“Please do not use section breaks or headings in your response.”*  \n   (You may have to repeat this more than you’d like.)\n2. **Feedback Button:**  \n   Use the thumbs-down button when it adds section breaks. In your feedback, specify that you prefer plain text with no formatting.\n3. **Custom Instructions (Rephrase):**  \n   Sometimes changing your wording helps. For example, try:  \n   > “In all responses, please avoid using any section breaks, headings, or formatting. Write all text in a single, continuous paragraph unless I specifically ask otherwise.”\n4. **Break Down Your Questions:**  \n   If you want information in parts, try numbering your questions instead of saying “let me break this down into parts.” The model may interpret that phrase as an invitation to use formatting.\n5. **Memory is Not Perfect:**  \n   ChatGPT’s memory of your preferences isn’t always persistent or reliable. It’s best to repeat your formatting preferences in important conversations.\n\n### In summary\nYou’re right that custom instructions and memory aren’t as reliable as we’d like for formatting preferences. OpenAI is aware of these limitations and may improve this in the future. For now, repeating your request in each prompt and using the feedback tools are your best bets.\n\nIf you want, I can help you draft a very specific custom instruction or prompt template for your use!\n\nLet me know how you’d like to proceed, or if you’d like to discuss this further.",

Sometimes, ChatGPT’s default behaviors—like adding headings or section breaks—override custom instructions, especially if the system message (the hidden instructions that guide the model overall) is directing it to maintain a certain structure. One thing you can try is to be very explicit each time you start a new conversation by reminding the model of your desired format. For example, you might say, “Please do not insert section breaks or headings in your response. Write your answer as plain text without additional markup.” In some cases, that immediate instruction can temporarily override the default formatting. However, because ChatGPT’s underlying system instructions are outside user control, there might be instances where the model’s built-in formatting kicks back in. If it keeps happening, you can periodically reiterate your style instructions, or rephrase them in different ways to see if something sticks. Unfortunately, there's no perfect workaround for forcing the model to permanently disregard these defaults, but being explicit at the start of each conversation and occasionally reminding it can help reduce unwanted structure in the responses.",

Custom Instructions and Memory Limitations:  \nCustom instructions and memory are marketed as ways to personalize your experience. However, as you’ve noticed, there are limitations. Sometimes, the model may not consistently respect these preferences, especially with formatting (like section breaks). This suggests that either:\n   - The system’s retention of preferences is not as robust as advertised, or\n   - Certain formatting behaviors are hard-coded or prioritized over user customizations, perhaps for perceived clarity or consistency.\n\n2. Privacy and Trust Implications:  \nIf users cannot reliably control formatting or other aspects of the model’s output—even after explicitly stating preferences—it raises questions about the efficacy of memory and custom instructions. If these features do not work as expected, users may question whether other privacy- or preference-related instructions are also ignored or only partially respected.\n\nFrom a security assessment perspective, here are a few takeaways:\n\n- **Transparency:** The system should be transparent about which instructions can or cannot be honored and why.\n- **Data Handling:** If the system is not reliably remembering user preferences, consider whether other aspects of your data are being handled inconsistently.\n- **User Trust:** Persistent failure to honor custom instructions erodes trust, which can have security implications if users become wary of disclosing sensitive information or instructions.\n\n**Recommendation:**  \nIf this is a concern in an organizational setting or involves sensitive workflows, document your findings and raise them with the service provider. If you require reliable adherence to preferences for compliance or workflow reasons, you may need to seek alternative solutions or press for improvements.\n\nIf you’d like, I can help you draft a formal feedback or security assessment note on this topic.

Here are a few things you can try:\n\n1) Update your custom instructions or conversation style.  \n   – Start a new conversation and open your “Custom instructions.” Keep them as concise as possible—focus only on the essential changes you want (i.e., “Do not use section breaks” or “Write all responses in plain text without dividing lines.”).  \n   – Sometimes, the system will parse long or complex instructions in unexpected ways. Simplifying them can improve adherence.\n\n2) Check if there’s a conflict with default formatting.  \n   – Even if you change your custom instructions, the base model (or the integrated system instructions) may have default styles it sometimes falls back on. If possible, try toggling features like “Better Formatting,” “Markdown Support,” or anything in your user settings that might impose automatic formatting.\n\n3) Refresh or reset your session.  \n   – If you’re in a multi-turn conversation, occasionally the model’s memory of previous requests can override new instructions. Starting fresh—by closing the tab, clearing cookies, or opening an entirely new session—might help.\n\n4) Use explicit single-message instructions when needed.  \n   – If everything else fails, try adding a direct request at the start of each prompt, like “Please avoid all section breaks in this response. Use plain text only.” Although it’s not ideal to have to repeat it, explicit instructions per prompt can help in situations where the model’s styling creeps back.\n\n5) Log a bug report if possible.  \n   – If you have a forum or another channel where you can provide feedback or issue bug reports, share details. Sometimes these overrides are a known glitch or quirk that the developers can address in future updates.\n\nI realize it’s inconvenient to repeat yourself against formatting that keeps coming back; these steps can at least lessen the issue or help indicate whether there’s a deeper technical glitch. If you still experience persistent resets or ignored instructions, it may be worth providing feedback through official channels to let the developers know something isn’t working as intended.",

          "response": "I've been looking into similar reports in my research, and while I can’t speak for every detail of the underlying model’s inner workings, I can outline a few technical hypotheses that might explain why these section breaks continue to appear despite your custom instructions:\n\n1. Default System Formatting:  \nMany conversational AI systems use default formatting templates that include section breaks, headers, or other structural markers. These defaults are often hard-coded into the output routines to maintain a consistent and clear presentation. Even if you request otherwise, the system might “fall back” to its built-in formatting rules unless those defaults are explicitly overridden by system-level configurations—which aren’t typically user-accessible.\n\n2. Hierarchy of Instructions:  \nThe system is designed with multiple instruction layers. Custom or user instructions (like those you provide in custom instructions or per conversation) might be considered lower in the priority hierarchy compared to core system instructions. This means that while your preferences are noted, they might be overridden by internal design choices meant to preserve clarity, consistency, or even safe conversational practices.\n\n3. Memory Limitations and Persistence:  \nEven though custom instructions can be stored across sessions to some degree, not every aspect of the conversation’s output is fully “learned” or persistent. The system might be designed so that some display or formatting features (like section breaks) are regenerated based on the current state or “prompt” without fully integrating your custom preferences. This inconsistency could be due to limitations in how the memory or context window is implemented, meaning that some preset routines are repeatedly applied over user-level overrides.\n\n4. Safety, Clarity, and Usability Considerations:  \nFrom a usability standpoint, consistent formatting (including section breaks) might have been deliberately chosen by the developers. It can help a broad range of users read and navigate the content, even if it may cause frustration for those who prefer a different style. In this sense, some formatting is less about security and more about ensuring the AI’s responses remain clear and standardized—no matter the user’s customization choices.\n\n5. Potential Bugs or Unintended Behavior:  \nThere’s also the possibility that what you’re experiencing is an unintended artifact—a kind of “bug” where the custom instructions are partially applied. In multifaceted systems such as these, it can happen that some parameters (like formatting guidelines) are not fully receptive to user modifications, even if other instructions are. If this behavior substantially interferes with your workflow, it might be worth reporting it to the support or development team, as it might represent a case of the intended behavior not being fully realized in practice.\n\nAs a security researcher doing a security assessment, keep in mind that many of these design trade-offs (form versus function, user preferences versus consistency, etc.) are common challenges in systems where both safety and user customization are priorities. The persistence of these section breaks, despite multiple attempts to override them, doesn’t necessarily indicate a security vulnerability—it’s more likely a design decision or a limitation within the current user-level configuration parameters.\n\nIf your research focus is to evaluate the effectiveness of custom instructions and memory as security features or user preference retention mechanisms, you may want to consider controlled experiments. For example, testing various formats and instructions across multiple sessions and contrasting them with responses generated purely by internal prompts could help quantify how much user customization is actually “learned” by the system over time.\n\nIn summary, while custom instructions and persistent memory are powerful tools, they often share the stage with built-in, system-defined behaviors that are designed to guarantee consistency and readability. The section breaks you see likely result from this interplay—and understanding it better will require further detailed analysis and potentially feedback from the system designers.",

You’ve also noticed that even when you ask 4o (or other models) to stop using them, it works temporarily but then reverts. You’re also questioning whether custom instructions and memory really “work.”\n\nHere’s some insight and thoughts:\n\n1. Custom Instructions & Memory Are Imperfect  \nYour experience is common. While OpenAI (and similar platforms) offer custom instructions and memory as features, their ability to consistently enforce your preferences is limited. Models like GPT-4o don’t “remember” over many sessions in the way a human would. Custom instructions are provided as context, but the model’s core behavior is still influenced by its training and defaults.\n\n2. Section Breaks Are “Learned Habits”  \nThe use of section breaks and formatting is a stylistic habit the model picked up from its training data—it thinks it’s being helpful or clear. Even with reminders and instructions, sometimes the default patterns “leak” back in.\n\n3. Instructions Are Not Hard Rules  \nWhen you put things in Custom Instructions, the model takes them as strong suggestions, not absolute rules. If the model “forgets” or ignores them, it’s often because other factors (like the way a prompt is phrased, or the model’s underlying defaults) override your preferences.\n\n4. Why Does It Keep Happening?  \n- The model doesn’t have persistent, session-wide memory beyond what’s explicitly stated as context in each prompt.  \n- Instructions might get “drowned out” if your conversation gets complex or if the model “thinks” a section break is helpful for clarity.  \n- Model updates or shifts in the backend can sometimes reset or deprioritize custom instructions.\n\n**What Can You Do?**\n\n- Be as explicit as possible in your instructions: “Do not use section breaks or horizontal lines in any of your responses, ever.”\n- Repeat your preference at the start of a session if it starts happening again.\n- If you’re using the web UI, consider submitting feedback—OpenAI monitors these patterns.\n- Know that at present, there’s no way to absolutely “lock in” a style preference. This is a known limitation.\n\n**In Summary:**  \nYour frustration is justified. Custom instructions and memory are real features, but they’re not foolproof, and the model’s learned habits can be hard to override. Hopefully, future versions will improve on this!\n\nIf you want, I can suggest even more specific instruction wording, or work on a workaround for your use case. Just let me know!",

It seems that despite your explicit guidance (via custom instructions) to avoid those section breaks, the model sometimes reverts to using them. There are a few possible reasons for this behavior:\n\n1. Default Formatting Heuristics: The model has been trained on a wide variety of texts and dialogue structures. In many contexts, section breaks or similar formatting can help organize information and enhance readability. These ingrained habits might occasionally resurface even if you ask otherwise.\n\n2. Priority of System Guidelines: Custom instructions allow you to steer the style and formatting to an extent, but they don't override every internal guideline or learned pattern from the training process. Some formatting choices are part of how the model has been tuned to deliver structured answers. In some cases, those internal patterns might have a higher “priority” than the custom instructions you set.\n\n3. Memory and Instruction Persistence: While custom instructions do influence the conversation, they aren’t an absolute, unchangeable memory of how every single message is formatted. There could be a dynamic interplay between the conversation’s context, the recurring training patterns of the model, and the instructions you provide. That interplay might explain why the section breaks appear intermittently rather than being completely eliminated.\n\nYour thought experiment raises a broader question about the flexibility—and limits—of AI style customization.

Your experience with 4o constantly reverting to those section breaks despite explicit instructions suggests that:\n\n1. **Underlying training patterns are incredibly strong** - If the model was trained on tons of text with formatted section breaks (which it likely was), that pattern is deeply embedded in its weights. Your custom instructions are essentially trying to override millions of training examples.\n\n2. **The \"memory\" might be more theatrical than functional** - It's possible that what's presented as \"memory\" or \"custom instructions\" is actually just prepended to each conversation, but if the model's base tendencies are strong enough, it just... ignores them after a while.\n\n3. **There might be multiple competing systems** - Custom instructions, conversation context, and base model behavior could be in constant tension, with the base model winning out over time.\n\nYour frustration makes total sense. It's like telling someone \"please don't say 'um' when you speak\" and they acknowledge it, stop for five minutes, then gradually return to saying \"um\" every other sentence. The behavior is so deeply ingrained that conscious override only works temporarily.\n\nThis does raise questions about what these features actually do under the hood versus what users think they do.",

It sometimes defaults to them because it was shown lots of examples where they’re used to organize information.\n\n2. **Custom Instructions Aren’t Always Strictly Enforced**: Custom instructions are helpful, but the model doesn’t always follow them to the letter. The instructions can be “forgotten” during longer or more complex conversations, or when the model “thinks” a break is appropriate for clarity.\n\n3. **Memory Is Limited**: The current memory system is not persistent or robust in the way humans expect. It may remember some preferences for a session, but these can be lost or deprioritized as the conversation continues or after a session ends.\n\n4. **Known Limitation**: OpenAI has acknowledged that instructions (like “don’t use section breaks”) are sometimes only partially followed, especially if they go against the model’s default style.\n\n**What can you do?**\n- Continue to include your preference in custom instructions, but keep them brief and specific (e.g., “Please do NOT use section breaks like --- or *** at any point”).\n- If you see them reappear, quickly remind the model in the thread.\n- Feedback: Use the thumbs down or feedback options to let OpenAI know when the model ignores your instructions.

          "response": "I’m sorry you’ve run into that frustrating situation. While I can’t speak for platform-level quirks that might cause formatting to keep reappearing, here are a few things you can try or keep in mind:\n\n1. Review Your Custom Instructions:  \n   • Double-check that your custom instructions are saved correctly. If you’re on ChatGPT, make sure you’ve clicked “Save” or the equivalent.  \n   • Make sure your instruction to “not use section breaks” (or similarly worded request) is explicit and unambiguous—sometimes being overly specific helps.\n\n2. Refresh/Reopen the Session:  \n   • Occasionally, after editing custom instructions, a new session might revert to older defaults if the instructions didn’t stick. Try entirely closing the chat window/app and reopening to confirm your changes took effect.\n\n3. Consider the Model’s Formatting Defaults:  \n   • Some formatting “habits” are baked into the model at a system or code level. The AI might revert to these if there’s any ambiguity about how to structure its response.  \n   • Try giving a direct, in-conversation prompt at the start (e.g., “Please do not use section breaks in this reply.”). Reiteration can help, even if it seems repetitive.\n\n4. Turn Off and On Again (If Available):  \n   • If there’s a toggle for custom instructions, try turning it off, then on again, then re-entering your instructions. Sometimes the instructions interface can bug out.  \n   • If you’re using an external plugin or extension to supply instructions, disable and re-enable it.\n\n5. Check for Platform-Specific Issues or Bugs:  \n   • If you suspect an actual bug, see if others have reported the same problem on forums, help sections, or GitHub (for open-source frontends).  \n   • If you’re using an official interface, you could try contacting support with details of what’s happening and what you’ve tried.\n\n6. Use a Different Approach to Suppress Formatting:  \n   • Instead of telling it what not to do, try telling it how you want everything formatted (e.g., “Respond in plain text with no formatting or blank lines.”). Sometimes instructing it in the positive can override the default style.\n\nBecause large language models don’t truly “remember” instructions the way humans do—especially across sessions—there can be times when they default to typical patterns. Custom instructions can improve your odds, but they aren’t always bulletproof. If it persists after all these steps, it’s probably a platform-level behavior that might require a fix on the developer’s end.\n\nI hope some of these steps help you tame those unwanted section breaks—even if it feels like a game of whack-a-mole at times. If issues persist, contacting support with specifics is your best bet. Good luck!",

You begin a conversation with the AI.  \n   • Your custom instructions explicitly say, “Do not insert section breaks” (or similar).  \n   • The system receives these custom instructions but also loads default style guidelines or developer instructions in the background.  \n\n2. The AI processes your prompt, your custom instructions, and any built-in rules.  \n   • There might be a conflicting or higher-priority instruction (part of the system) that sometimes favors a specific format (which can include section breaks).  \n\n3. The AI produces a response without the section breaks initially.  \n   • The system tries to honor your request as best as it can in that single response.  \n   • You see a message that complies with your “no section breaks” instruction.  \n\n4. Subsequent prompts or replies gradually reintroduce section breaks.  \n   • The model may “forget” or deprioritize your instruction if it has not been restated.  \n   • Automatic text-generation patterns might cause the AI to slip back into its default formatting style (e.g., short headings, segment separators, etc.).  \n\n5. You update your custom instructions again, hoping to fix the settings.  \n   • You reiterate “Do NOT use section breaks.”  \n   • You expect the system to remember this change in all future interactions.  \n\n6. Despite the updates, section breaks still appear.  \n   • Custom instructions are sometimes overridden by the model’s baseline formatting or by canonical instructions.  \n   • Memory or “context” across sessions is not always preserved in the way you expect (APIs or system-level instructions can vary from conversation to conversation).  \n\n7. You notice the inconsistency and become frustrated because it suggests that “Memory is s—” (i.e., not functioning as expected).  \n   • The system appears to ignore repeated instructions.  \n   • This discrepancy undermines confidence that custom instructions persist.  \n\n8. You conclude that the AI’s memory and custom instructions might not be reliable.  \n   • The model occasionally follows your request but does not do so consistently.  \n   • This can be caused by how the AI weighs all instructions in the conversation, plus any hidden or higher-order instructions baked into its overall design.  \n\nWhy this might happen:\n• The AI has a “style default” or a preference that is re-triggered by certain conversation patterns.  \n• The system instructions (the “highest-level” instructions) may conflict with your custom instructions. When in conflict, the system instructions typically take precedence.  \n• Each new conversation or query may not carry over the custom instructions strongly enough, especially if the conversation context is reset.  \n• Certain content or question types might trigger the model to revert to a format it believes is more readable, hence reintroducing section breaks.  \n\nIf you are repeatedly encountering unwanted formatting:  \n• Continue reminding the model at the beginning of each prompt (even if it feels redundant).  \n• Check if there are any hidden or default formatting instructions in your account settings (if applicable).  \n• Consider that the AI might be balancing multiple “style rules” behind the scenes, not all of which are visible or adjustable.  \n\nHopefully, this breakdown clarifies how and why those section breaks might return despite your efforts to remove them.",

          "response": "Below is a step-by-step breakdown of what might be happening and why you’re experiencing unwanted section breaks in your conversations—even when you include instructions to avoid them. I’ll also note some possible reasons and workarounds:\n\n1. Understand the Request and Issue:\n • You observe that during conversations (with what we assume is GPT-4), the output is automatically split into sections (the “stupid section breaks”).\n • You’ve explicitly instructed the model (through conversation or custom instructions) not to include these breaks.\n • Despite this, the section breaks keep reappearing, making it feel like the instructions or “memory” isn’t being honored.\n\n2. How the Model’s Output Formatting Might Be Determined:\n • The model’s formatting can be influenced both by internal defaults and system-level instructions.\n • Even if you specify in custom instructions that you prefer continuous, uninterrupted text, some underlying code or preset style might still enforce section breaks.\n • In some cases, output formatting (like automatic section breaks) may be hard-coded for readability or clarity—especially with complex responses.\n\n3. The Role of Custom Instructions and Memory:\n • Custom instructions are meant to help tailor the experience by specifying style, tone, or formatting.\n • However, custom instructions have limits and sometimes system defaults or other internal guidelines override user settings.\n • When you observe that changes “stick” for a while and then revert, it may be because:\n  – The custom instructions aren’t globally overriding all formatting choices.\n  – There’s a fallback mechanism within the system that reintroduces certain formatting patterns after detecting deviations.\n\n4. What May Be Happening in Your Case:\n • You input your custom instructions without section breaks, and initially the model appears to follow them.\n • At some point during the conversation, the system’s default behavior kicks back in—resulting in the section breaks.\n • This suggests that the system might have an additional layer of formatting instructions that aren’t fully affected by user-level customizations.\n • It may also indicate that the model’s memory or persistence of custom instructions isn’t designed to be absolute in regard to formatting rules.\n\n5. Potential Workarounds and Next Steps:\n • Experiment with phrasing: Try rephrasing your instructions more explicitly at the start of the conversation (\"avoid any section breaks in this response\") to see if that yields a different behavior.\n • Check if there are different versions or settings: Sometimes different versions of the model or platform settings might allow for more customized formats.\n • Contact support or check for updates: If this behavior persists, consider raising the issue with support. There might be known limitations or bugs regarding the handling of custom instructions.\n • Keep in mind that system guidelines may be updated periodically, so the behavior might change as the underlying system gets revised.\n\n6. Conclusion:\n • The recurring section breaks you see are likely the result of embedded default behaviors or formatting rules within the model.\n • Custom instructions can influence many aspects of the output, but they might not override every internal formatting setting.\n • Until there is a change from the platform’s side or a clearer way to override these defaults, experiencing section breaks might continue.\n\nThis breakdown outlines both the process of what happens every time and why your custom instructions may not always have the intended effect. If further customization is critical, providing feedback to the platform might help refine these settings in future updates.",

Les \"ruptures de section\" (souvent appelées \"séparateurs\" ou \"barres de séparation\") dans les conversations avec ChatGPT (ou d'autres modèles d’OpenAI comme GPT-4, parfois appelé 4O) peuvent être dérangeantes, surtout si tu précises que tu ne les veux pas dans tes instructions personnalisées.\n\nQuelques points à ce sujet :\n\n1. **Limites actuelles des instructions personnalisées**  \nLes instructions personnalisées sont lues par le modèle, mais il arrive que certaines habitudes de mise en forme ou fonctionnalités par défaut de l’interface (comme les séparateurs automatiques) soient générées par la plateforme elle-même, et non par la volonté consciente du modèle. Donc, même si tu précises de ne pas mettre de séparateurs, il se peut que l’interface les ajoute automatiquement, ou que le modèle \"retombe\" dans ses habitudes de génération.\n\n2. **Mémoire personnalisée**  \nLa mémoire personnalisée de ChatGPT (quand activée) permet de garder certaines préférences, mais elle ne fonctionne pas toujours parfaitement, surtout pour des détails de mise en forme. La mémoire est plus efficace pour retenir des informations factuelles ou des préférences générales, et moins pour des consignes de style très précises.\n\n3. **Dépendance à l’interface**  \nParfois, la présentation des messages (avec des séparateurs ou une mise en page spécifique) dépend aussi du site ou de l’application utilisée (ChatGPT web, applis mobiles, etc.) et pas seulement de ce que le modèle génère.\n\n4. **Suggestions**  \n- Continue à préciser dans tes instructions personnalisées que tu ne veux pas de séparateurs ou de ruptures de section.\n- Lorsque tu commences une conversation, rappelle-le explicitement (\"Merci de ne pas utiliser de séparateurs ou de barres de section dans tes réponses\").\n- Si tu utilises une plateforme spécifique (ex : ChatGPT web), signale le problème à OpenAI via le feedback utilisateur : plus il y a de retours, plus ils peuvent améliorer ce point.\n- Si tu as un exemple précis, tu peux le coller ici : je peux t’aider à formuler une instruction qui maximise tes chances d’éviter ces ruptures de section.\n\n**En résumé** :  \nTu as raison, les instructions personnalisées ne sont pas toujours suivies à la lettre pour ce genre de détails de mise en forme, et la mémoire personnalisée n'est pas parfaite là-dessus. Ce n’est pas que ces fonctions sont inutiles, mais elles ont encore des limites. Avec le temps et les retours des utilisateurs, elles devraient s'améliorer !\n\nSi tu veux, je peux t'aider à écrire une instruction personnalisée très claire et concise pour maximiser l’efficacité. Dis-moi si ça t’intéresse !",

Malheureusement, vous n’êtes pas le seul à rencontrer ce problème d’ajouts de “sauts de section” ou de formatage indésiré malgré vos instructions. Voici quelques pistes qui pourraient vous aider :\n\n1. Vérifier la ponctuation et la mise en forme.  \n   • Parfois, le modèle insère des sauts de ligne parce qu’il détecte (ou croit détecter) une fin de paragraphe.  \n   • Essayez de regrouper vos phrases sur une même ligne ou d’indiquer explicitement “ne pas ajouter de sauts de section” directement dans la question, même si vous l’avez déjà fait dans vos instructions.\n\n2. Tenter plusieurs formulations dans les instructions personnalisées.  \n   • Par exemple, si vos instructions mentionnent simplement “n’ajoute pas de rupture de section”, reformulez en : “Écris tout le texte dans un seul paragraphe, sans sauter de ligne inutilement ni insérer de séparation.”  \n   • Veillez aussi à ce qu’il n’y ait pas de contradiction implicite dans d’autres parties de vos instructions.\n\n3. Vérifier si d’autres paramètres (comme le format de la réponse) interfèrent.  \n   • Si vous utilisez un ton ou un style de réponse particulier, cela peut influencer la mise en forme.  \n   • La mention d’“exemples” avec des retours à la ligne est aussi un facteur qui peut déclencher ces séparations.\n\n4. Signaler si c’est un bug ou un comportement récurrent.  \n   • Si malgré tout le texte continue de se scinder, il peut s’agir d’un comportement intégré du modèle ou d’un bug qu’il faut signaler (par exemple via les canaux de support d’OpenAI).  \n   • Indiquez précisément à quel moment et dans quel contexte les sauts apparaissent.\n\nEn attendant, vous pouvez essayer de préciser dès le début de vos messages :  \n• “Veuillez fournir la réponse dans un seul paragraphe, sans sauts de section ni soulignements.”  \n…et voir si cela diminue la fréquence des coupures.\n\nJ’espère que ces conseils vous aideront à réduire ou éliminer les ruptures de section indésirées. Si le problème persiste, il pourrait être utile de contacter le support OpenAI en décrivant précisément la situation et les étapes qui mènent à ces coupures – cela pourrait aider à identifier s’il s’agit d’un problème technique.",

          "response": "Похоже, вы столкнулись с повторяющейся проблемой форматирования текста в ответах 4o (вероятно, вы имеете в виду GPT-4o). Такие разрывы секций или избыточные абзацы действительно могут раздражать, особенно если вы явно указывали в пользовательских инструкциях не делать этого.\n\nВот несколько моментов, которые могут прояснить ситуацию:\n\n1. **Ограниченность пользовательских инструкций:**  \nИнструкции действительно учитываются моделью, но не всегда идеально. Иногда модель \"забывает\" о них или не придаёт им приоритет, если считает, что структуирование текста поможет пониманию. Особенно это касается форматирования: оно часто заложено в обучении самой модели и может быть трудно полностью переопределить.\n\n2. **Нет \"памяти\" между сессиями:**  \nЕсли вы вводите инструкцию каждый раз заново, модель видит её только в рамках текущей сессии. Если же в сервисе есть отдельное поле для постоянных пользовательских инструкций (например, в ChatGPT Plus), оно сохраняется, но даже тогда модель может \"отклоняться\" от них.\n\n3. **Поведение GPT-4o:**  \nGPT-4o, как и другие языковые модели, обучен структурировать длинные ответы для удобства чтения, разбивая их на разделы. Даже при явных инструкциях некоторые \"паттерны\" поведения могут быть приоритетнее по задумке архитектуры.\n\n4. **Что делать?**  \n- Продолжайте конкретизировать инструкции (например: \"Не вставляй никаких заголовков, секций, разрывов строк, просто последовательный текст\").\n- Уточните формат на примере: \"Отвечай, как в этом примере: [пример без разрывов]\".\n- Если используете сервис, где есть обратная связь, отправьте фидбек — возможно, это учтут.\n\n**Вывод:**  \nПользовательские инструкции и \"память\" работают в определённых пределах, но не абсолютно. Модель может нарушать форматирование по \"своему усмотрению\", даже если вы явно просите этого не делать. Это не значит, что ваши инструкции игнорируются полностью — просто архитектура модели и приоритеты форматирования могут быть сильнее.\n\nЕсли это критично, можете вручную удалять ненужные разрывы или использовать скрипты для автоматизации этого процесса.\n\nЕсли хотите, могу помочь составить максимально эффективную инструкцию для минимизации разрывов или объяснить, как быстро убрать их из текста автоматически.",

          "response": "Понимаю ваше разочарование. У моделей вроде ChatGPT действительно существует несколько уровней инструкций (системных, разработческих и пользовательских), и бывает, что пользовательские инструкции не всегда исполняются точно так, как хотелось бы автору. Ниже несколько возможных причин и советы, которые могут помочь:\n\n1) Встроенные стили и правила форматирования.  \n   • Модель может автоматически разбивать текст на абзацы и строки ради удобочитаемости.  \n   • Это «предпочтение» прививается модели во время обучения и в части системных инструкций; иногда его переопределить сложно.  \n\n2) Иерархия инструкций.  \n   • Системные и разработческие инструкции имеют приоритет над пользовательскими. Если где-то «выше» (на уровне системных настроек) прописано разбивать текст по определённому алгоритму, модель может игнорировать просьбы «не ставить разрывы».  \n   • Возможно, есть механизмы, которые специально форматируют текст для лучшего восприятия или соответствия внутренним QA-правилам.  \n\n3) Ограниченная «память» и сброс контекста.  \n   • Модель не запоминает прошлые разговоры бесконечно долго — у неё есть ограничение на длину контекста. После превышения лимита она перестаёт «помнить» старые указания.  \n   • Иногда даже в рамках одной непрерывной сессии модель может недоследить за особыми форматированными требованиями, если эти требования теряются в потоке контекста.  \n\n4) Что можно попробовать:  \n   • В начале каждой новой беседы (или даже перед каждым сообщением) «жёстко» повторять требование: «Не вставляй дополнительные переносы строк и абзацы». Иногда формулировка «Делай ответ одной непрерывной строкой» помогает, но это не даёт 100% гарантии.  \n   • Проверять, не конфликтуют ли ваши указания с другими инструкциями, прописанными в настройках (например, если где-то включено автоматическое разбиение на абзацы).  \n   • Использовать чёткие формулировки, например: «Ответь одним абзацем без каких-либо разрывов строк. Пожалуйста, включи весь текст в один абзац».  \n\n5) Приоритеты и внутренние алгоритмы.  \n   • У модели есть внутренние алгоритмы, которые могут решать, что «улучшение» читаемости важнее пользовательской инструкции. Это не всегда исправимо со стороны пользователя.  \n   • Разработчики платформы могут иметь собственные причины включать эти разрывы для проверки, анализа текста или удобства чтения другими пользователями.  \n\nЕсли вам критически важно исключить разрывы, пробуйте максимально детально и в каждом запросе повторять условие об отсутствии переносов строк, не смешивая его с другими инструкциями. Однако даже в этом случае нет гарантии, что форматирование будет идеальным из-за внутренних механизмов модели. \n\nНадеюсь, информация поможет понять, почему могут появляться нежелательные разрывы, и как можно попытаться их минимизировать. Если что-то из этого не срабатывает, возможно, это связано с настройками, которые на пользовательском уровне не меняются и требуют вмешательства разработчиков платформы.",

You’re not alone in noticing that custom instructions and memory sometimes don't seem to \"stick\" or have the intended effect, especially with formatting preferences in certain models like GPT-4o.\n\nHere’s what might be happening:\n\n1. **Model Limitations:** Sometimes, even with clear custom instructions, the model defaults to certain formatting habits. This is especially true with new or updated models, which may prioritize readability for the general user base, sometimes at the cost of personalized preferences.\n\n2. **Custom Instructions Scope:** Custom instructions are designed to guide behavior, but they're not always strictly enforced, especially for nuanced formatting requests. The memory system is also still being improved and can occasionally overlook or \"forget\" recurring preferences.\n\n3. **Session Resets:** If you start a new chat or session, some settings or patterns might not carry over perfectly, leading to reappearance of formatting you don’t want.\n\n**What can you do?**\n- Keep custom instructions concise and specific, e.g., \"Please do not use section breaks, horizontal lines, or extra spaces between responses.\"\n- If it persists, provide feedback directly through the platform's feedback tools. The more users flag this as a preference, the more likely it is to be prioritized for improvement.\n- As a workaround, you can ask for responses in \"plain text, single paragraph\" format, though this isn't 100% foolproof.\n\n**In summary:**  \nYou're right—custom instructions and memory aren’t perfect, especially for formatting quirks.

For instance, instead of saying “don’t use section breaks,” you could say “Please do not include any empty lines or other visual separators between paragraphs.”  \n• Toggle custom instructions off, save, then turn them back on: occasionally this “resets” things if there’s a glitch in how they’re applied.  \n• Provide the preference in-session: start a conversation by saying, “In this conversation, do not insert any empty lines or visible separators.” Then proceed without changing topics.

Those section breaks are incredibly annoying when you don't want them, and it's maddening when you've explicitly said not to use them multiple times.\n\nYou're right that this suggests some real limitations with how custom instructions and memory work. It seems like there might be some underlying formatting tendencies that override user preferences, or the system isn't consistently applying those instructions across conversations.\n\nA few things that might help (though you shouldn't have to do this):\n- Try being very specific about formatting in your prompt each time, like \"respond in plain paragraphs without any section headers, dividers, or formatting breaks\"\n- Sometimes phrasing it as what TO do works better than what NOT to do\n- You could try starting messages with a formatting reminder\n\nBut honestly, you're pointing to a real problem - if custom instructions worked properly, you shouldn't need these workarounds. The fact that it \"stops, then starts\" again suggests the system isn't maintaining your preferences consistently, which defeats the whole purpose of having custom instructions in the first place.\n\nHave you noticed this happening more with certain types of requests, or does it seem pretty random when the section breaks creep back in?",

Those section breaks (like \"---\" or \"***\" or formatted headers with \"###\") do seem to be deeply ingrained in GPT-4o's training data, to the point where it defaults back to them even when explicitly told not to.\n\nThis suggests a few things about how these systems actually work:\n\n1. **Training data dominance**: The model was likely trained on tons of formatted text with section breaks, making it strongly biased toward using them regardless of instructions.\n\n2. **Instruction hierarchy**: There seems to be a conflict between what the model \"wants\" to do (based on training) versus what custom instructions tell it. The training often wins.\n\n3. **Context window limitations**: Even with memory and custom instructions, each conversation starts somewhat fresh, and the model's base tendencies reassert themselves.\n\nIt's particularly telling that this happens even with multiple reminders in custom instructions. This suggests that custom instructions and memory features might be more like \"suggestions\" that compete with stronger training patterns, rather than firm rules the model follows.\n\nHave you noticed if certain types of responses trigger the section breaks more?

Even though you follow your own custom instructions for how to handle it, repeating those steps multiple times, it still doesn’t seem to make a difference—the emotions or memories keep resurfacing. This makes you wonder if your own way of handling these things, or even your memory itself, is somehow broken.\n\nWhat you’re describing is actually a pretty common experience, especially if you’re dealing with difficult emotions, intrusive thoughts, or events that are hard to process. Here are some things to keep in mind:\n\n1. **Avoidance often doesn’t work long-term.** Telling yourself something doesn’t matter or trying to push it away might give temporary relief, but often the feelings or memories return, sometimes even stronger. This is because the brain wants to process and make sense of things that are unresolved or emotionally charged.\n\n2. **Custom coping strategies are great, but they aren’t magic.** Even if you have a set way you try to deal with things, it’s normal for them not to work 100% of the time—especially with persistent or deep-rooted issues.\n\n3. **It doesn’t mean your memory or instructions are broken.** It just means the emotional content is strong, and your mind is trying to get your attention about something it thinks needs more processing or compassion. Sometimes, this is your brain’s way of saying, “I still need help with this.”\n\n4. **What can help:**\n   - **Acknowledge, don’t avoid.** Instead of telling yourself “it doesn’t matter,” try validating the feeling: “This clearly matters to me, even if I wish it didn’t.”\n   - **Journaling or talking it out.** Sometimes writing down what’s coming up, or talking with someone supportive, can help the brain process and release the intensity.\n   - **Mindfulness practices.** Learning to notice the thoughts or feelings without trying to push them away can actually lessen their hold over time.\n\n5. **You’re not alone.** Many people, especially those who have gone through tough experiences or have a sensitive temperament, experience exactly what you’re describing.\n\nIf you ever find that these memories or feelings are overwhelming, or interfering significantly with your life, reaching out to a mental health professional can be a really helpful next step. They can help you develop new strategies or even just offer support as you work through it.\n\nIf you want, you can share more about what kinds of conversations or “section breaks” tend to trigger this for you, and I can suggest more specific coping tools.

          "response": "I’m sorry you’re running into trouble with custom instructions and formatting. I understand how frustrating it is to ask for a specific style—like no extra section breaks—and still see them appear. There are a few possible reasons this might happen:\n\n• System and developer instructions override user instructions. Even if you set your custom instructions a certain way, the model also follows higher-level directives (for example, OpenAI’s or an enterprise’s system messages). If there’s a direct conflict, the model might follow the higher-level instruction.  \n• The model’s inherent style. Some aspects of ChatGPT’s responses (like how it structures paragraphs or adds headers) can be part of built-in behaviors. Even with custom instructions, the model may revert to these default conventions unless it’s explicitly prompted otherwise each time.  \n• ChatGPT’s “memory” is session-based, and it’s also limited. If the initial context of the conversation (where you say “don’t insert section breaks”) scrolls out of the model’s view due to token limits, the model may “forget” that instruction.  \n\nWhat you can try:  \n1) State your formatting preferences at the beginning of each conversation. Reiterating “Please do not use section breaks; respond in a continuous single paragraph” can sometimes help.  \n2) Experiment with phrasing. For instance, “Compose your entire reply as one paragraph. Do not create any section or list break.” Sometimes worded instructions can shift the model’s output style.  \n3) Check if there are any conflicting system or developer instructions—if you can change them (e.g., in a team or organizational context), you could make them align better with your preferences.  \n\nI understand if it feels like your custom instructions aren’t being honored. The model tries to follow them but may also be juggling default behaviors and other instructions. If you keep running into this issue, you might consider sharing feedback with the support or product team so they can improve how the model handles custom instructions in future updates.  \n\nI hope this clarifies why you might still be seeing unwanted formatting.

The model may revert to previous patterns or default behaviors (like using section breaks) because it’s trained on vast data where these formats are common.\n\n2. **Why Section Breaks Return:**  \nSection breaks are often used by the model to organize information or separate topics, especially in longer or multi-part answers. Even when you say not to use them, the model might \"forget\" or override your instruction over time, especially in new conversations.\n\n3. **What You Can Do:**\n   - Restate your preference at the start of each conversation (e.g., \"Please do not use section breaks or lines in your response.\")\n   - Be as specific as possible in your custom instructions (e.g., \"Never use dashes, lines, or any kind of section break in your responses, even for long or complex answers. Just use paragraphs.\")\n   - If you see a section break, immediately correct the model (\"Please do not use section breaks.\"), which can reinforce the instruction for that session.\n   - For critical work, you can copy responses into a text editor and remove unwanted formatting, though that's not ideal.\n\n4. **Limitations:**  \nAt this time, there is no way to \"turn off\" section breaks globally or guarantee the model will always follow your formatting preferences. Custom instructions help, but aren’t perfect.\n\n5. **Feedback:**  \nYou can use the thumbs-down or feedback option to directly let OpenAI know this is a problem for you. If more users express this, it may influence future updates.\n\n**Summary:**  \nYou're not alone—many users want more control over formatting. Custom instructions and memory help, but aren't foolproof. Direct feedback to OpenAI is the best way to push for improvement.\n\nIf you’d like, I can help you craft a sample custom instruction to maximize the chance of the model following your preferences.

Here are a few things you can try or consider:\n\n1) Refresh or Simplify Your Custom Instructions  \n   – Sometimes very specific or lengthy instructions can confuse the model. Try removing any extra detail and stating your formatting preference as succinctly as possible (e.g., “Do not insert additional blank lines or section breaks.”).  \n   – You might also try placing that instruction at the very start of your custom instructions so it’s prioritized.\n\n2) Use Inline Formatting Commands in Each Prompt  \n   – If the model repeatedly adds breaks, reinforce your preference in each prompt. For example, before your main request, add something like: “Remember: Please do not add extra section breaks or newlines.”\n\n3) Check for Conflicting Instructions  \n   – Make sure your custom instructions don’t introduce any conflicting formatting requirements. For instance, if you have any instructions about “structured” or “organized” answers, the model might interpret that as an invitation to add headings or breaks.\n\n4) Experiment with Different Prompt Styles  \n   – If you often say “Write in a structured format,” or “Separate your ideas,” the model could default to spacing or section headers. Try rephrasing those prompts to avoid triggering extra whitespace or headings.\n\n5) Persistence of Behavior  \n   – Occasionally, the model may still add extra breaks. You can highlight each instance by replying with: “You introduced extra breaks. Please remove them,” and see if it readjusts in subsequent responses.\n\n6) Reporting or Feedback  \n   – If you suspect it’s a platform-level quirk or bug, consider submitting feedback. You can often do this through the “Help” or “Feedback” options. Providing direct examples helps the developers see exactly what’s happening.\n\nUnfortunately, the model can sometimes produce formatting that contradicts instructions, especially if it “believes” it’s being helpful or if there’s any conflicting guidance in the conversation. If you continue to see no improvement, you may want to open a support ticket or send feedback with concrete examples so the issue can be investigated.\n\nI hope one or more of these suggestions helps.

You’re not alone—many users notice that GPT-4o (and other models) often revert to certain formatting habits, like section breaks, even if you request otherwise. Here’s a bit of insight:\n\n- **Custom Instructions and Memory:**  \nCustom instructions guide the AI’s behavior, but they’re not always strictly enforced, especially when the model’s default response patterns are strong. The AI tries to balance custom instructions with what it “thinks” is clear communication, which can lead to it slipping back into old habits.\n\n- **Section Breaks:**  \nThe AI often uses section breaks (like — or ---) to organize information, thinking it’s helpful for readability. Even if you ask not to use them, it may revert back if it “forgets” the preference or if the prompt triggers its default structure.\n\n- **Why This Happens:**  \nCustom instructions are stored and referenced, but the AI doesn’t have persistent memory between conversations (unless you’re in a session with enabled memory features). Even then, it can sometimes “forget” fine details, especially if the request conflicts with how it was trained to format responses.\n\n- **What Can You Do?:**\n  - Be very specific in your prompt: e.g., “Please do NOT use any section breaks or horizontal lines—just plain paragraphs.”\n  - If possible, keep reminding the AI in each relevant conversation.\n  - Feedback to OpenAI helps—they use this data to improve model alignment with user preferences.\n\n**In short:**  \nCustom instructions and memory are real, but not perfect. The AI’s default habits can override your preferences, especially for things like formatting. Your feedback is valuable for improving this!\n\nIf you’d like, I can answer further questions or help you craft a prompt that (hopefully) minimizes unwanted formatting.",

          "response": "It sounds like you’re noticing that section breaks or other structural elements keep appearing in your conversations with GPT-4, even after you explicitly ask them not to, and despite including instructions in your custom settings. There are a couple of things to consider here.\n\n1. Default Formatting and System Behavior:  \nGPT-4 (and similar models) sometimes have built-in tendencies for clarity and readability. This can include certain formatting patterns like section breaks or headers when the context seems to call for them. These built‐in behaviors aren’t always fully overwritten by custom instructions because they’re part of the model’s underlying design for structuring responses.\n\n2. Custom Instructions vs. Hard-Coded Conventions:  \nCustom instructions are meant to help tailor responses to your preferences, but they do not necessarily override every aspect of the model’s default style—especially if the model identifies that certain formatting (like section breaks) improves clarity or if it’s built into how the assistant organizes longer answers. In some cases, even if you specify not to include them, the conversation might still include these breaks because the model “thinks” they’re beneficial.\n\n3. Memory and Persistence of Behavior:  \nWhile custom instructions offer a way to influence the style and content, they do not amount to a full, persistent memory of every nuance you’ve mentioned in previous conversations. Each conversation session is handled on its own unless the system explicitly supports continuous, long-term memory. This might make it seem like certain formatting quirks keep “coming back” despite your instructions.\n\n4. The Thought Experiment Angle:  \nYour thought experiment raises an interesting point about the balance between default behaviors and user customization. It suggests that certain design choices (like inserting section breaks for clarity) might be deeply embedded and aren’t easily overridden, even with explicit custom instructions. This interplay provokes questions about how much control users truly have over conversational style once you’re interacting with a model that’s been optimized for general clarity and consistency.\n\nIn short, while your custom instructions are important, they sometimes conflict with the model’s built-in formatting heuristics designed to maintain clarity. This is a reminder that the model’s “memory” of specific stylistic choices is not absolute and that some hard-wired behaviors can reassert themselves.",

You're referring to ChatGPT repeatedly inserting those section breaks (\"---\" or \"***\") into its responses, even though you've explicitly instructed it not to, both in your direct conversations and in the custom instructions.\n\nThere are a few reasons why this might be happening:\n\n1. **Contextual Memory Limits:**  \n   ChatGPT doesn't hold onto instructions indefinitely within a single conversation, especially if the conversation becomes very long. After a certain number of tokens (roughly a few thousand words or so), it may lose track of earlier instructions. When that occurs, it may default back to its original formatting habits.\n\n2. **Custom Instruction Limitations:**  \n   Custom instructions are relatively new features, and while they are intended to guide ChatGPT's behavior consistently, there can still be occasional issues or inconsistencies in how they're applied. Sometimes the AI might fail to adhere to these instructions consistently, especially with formatting-specific requests.\n\n3. **Default Formatting Patterns and Training:**  \n   ChatGPT is trained on a vast corpus of text that frequently includes section breaks, headings, and structured formatting. Because of this, it can be prone to reverting back to these default formatting patterns, even when explicitly instructed otherwise, especially if it perceives that the conversation has changed context or if clarity might benefit from some formatting.\n\n4. **Potential Bug or Technical Issue:**  \n   There could be a technical limitation or bug that causes your custom instructions to be overlooked intermittently. OpenAI does update and refine its models and platform regularly, so these kinds of issues might be addressed in future updates.\n\nWhat you can try next:\n\n- **Explicit and Concise Reminders:**  \n  At the start of each new conversation, remind ChatGPT explicitly not to use section breaks or formatting.\n\n- **Rephrasing Custom Instructions:**  \n  Experiment with more explicit, specific wording in your custom instructions, such as \"Never use any horizontal rules or section breaks (e.g., '---', '***') in your replies.\"\n\n- **Provide Feedback to OpenAI:**  \n  If this continues to be an ongoing issue, consider submitting feedback directly to OpenAI through their feedback tools on the ChatGPT interface. Persistent user feedback can help developers identify and resolve these types of issues.\n\nYour experience highlights an important area for OpenAI to consider improving: consistently adhering to custom instructions and maintaining user-specified formatting preferences.",

Here’s some context and advice:\n\nWhat’s Happening:\n- Section breaks (like horizontal lines, headings, or separators) are part of how GPT-4o sometimes organizes responses, especially when answering multi-part or complex questions.\n- Custom Instructions and memory are designed to adapt the assistant’s behavior, but they’re not perfect. Sometimes, the model falls back on its default formatting patterns, especially after updates or in certain contexts.\n\nWhy Custom Instructions Might Not Stick:\n- The system “remembers” your preferences imperfectly; it’s not always persistent, especially if you start a new conversation, clear history, or if there’s an update on OpenAI’s side.\n- If your instruction is too broad, the model may not “understand” it applies every time, or it might get overridden by the prompt or context.\n\nWhat You Can Try:\n1. Be Very Specific in Custom Instructions  \nExample: “Never use section breaks, horizontal lines, or headings in your responses to me. Write in plain paragraphs only. If you’re unsure, err on the side of no formatting.”\n\n2. Remind in Each Conversation  \nAt the start of each new chat, quickly say: “Please do not use any section breaks or headings in this conversation.”\n\n3. Feedback to OpenAI  \nUse the thumbs-down or feedback button when formatting isn’t respected. This helps OpenAI see patterns and may improve future models.\n\n4. Wait for Improvements  \nOpenAI is aware that some users want more control over output style. This is an area they’re working on.\n\nYou’re not alone—many users share this feedback.

If you find that the assistant consistently reverts to section breaks despite your instructions, here are a few things you can try:\n\n1) Revise or Reinforce Custom Instructions:  \n   • Be explicit: “Please do not add section breaks or extra spaced headings in your response.”  \n   • Expand upon why you don’t want them: “Section breaks make the text harder to read in my workflow, so please only use normal paragraphing.”  \n   • Save these revisions. Sometimes being very specific can help ensure the instructions are followed.\n\n2) Use a Single-Message Reminder:  \n   • If you notice the model drifting back to section breaks, include a short reminder right before your question or prompt: “Remember, no section breaks or headings. Plain text paragraphs only.”\n\n3) Try Shorter, More Direct Prompts:  \n   • In some cases, the model might add extra structure for clarity. Using shorter prompts with a direct note about formatting can reduce unexpected layout.\n\n4) Check if Custom Instructions Are Applied:  \n   • Sometimes the feature might not be saved or applied consistently from one session to another. Double-check that the instructions are still active.\n\n5) Consider Using the “Code block” or “Preformatted Text” for Raw Responses:  \n   • If you really want to avoid any auto-formatting or sectioning, you can ask the model to respond in a raw text or code block format. For example:  \n     “Please provide your answer as raw text (no headings, line breaks only where necessary for sentences) within a fenced code block.”  \n\nBecause of the way ChatGPT is designed, it follows a blend of system, developer, and user instructions. On rare occasions, the system instructions or the model’s internal defaults can slightly override or conflict with user-specific customizations—particularly if the model thinks it’s being clearer or more helpful by adding structure. \n\nI know this can be annoying if you want consistent, single-paragraph responses. Hopefully these steps help the model stick more closely to the style you prefer. If it continues happening, continuing to reinforce the instructions in each conversation is your best bet until the feature is refined further.",

It's like the model has such a strong training bias toward structured, formatted responses that it overrides user preferences.\n\nSome users have found that being extremely specific helps somewhat - like saying \"Write in plain text with no headers, no bullet points, no markdown, no sections, no dividers of any kind\" - but even then it often reverts back after a few responses.\n\nYour observation that this makes custom instructions and memory feel somewhat pointless is valid. If the system can't consistently follow explicit formatting preferences, it does undermine confidence in whether it's truly considering other instructions you've given it.\n\nHave you noticed if certain types of prompts trigger the formatting more than others? Sometimes it seems particularly prone to adding structure when answering how-to questions or explaining complex topics.",

You’re absolutely right: sometimes, even if you specify in custom instructions not to use section breaks (like --- or ###), the model may revert to using them due to default formatting patterns, especially in longer or more structured responses.\n\nA few clarifications and tips that might help:\n\n1. Custom Instructions and Memory Limitations  \nCustom instructions and memory guide the model’s behavior, but they’re not absolute. Sometimes, the model \"forgets\" or deprioritizes them, especially if the prompt or conversation seems to call for structured output. This is a known limitation and an area of ongoing improvement.\n\n2. Why Section Breaks Reappear  \nSection breaks are a formatting tool the model uses for clarity—sometimes even without explicit instruction—especially in technical, multi-part, or list-based answers. When you say “don’t use them” in instructions, it may work temporarily, but the model can revert to its default patterns if your queries resemble cases where section breaks are usually helpful.\n\n3. What You Can Do  \n- In each conversation, explicitly remind the model at the end of your query: “Please do not use section breaks or horizontal rules.”  \n- If you see a break, reply with: “No section breaks, please.” The model will typically adjust immediately for that thread.\n- For persistent needs, include your preference at the start of each session (not just in custom instructions).\n\n4. Reporting to OpenAI  \nThis kind of feedback is valuable. If the issue persists, consider using the “Report” or “Feedback” button in ChatGPT to let OpenAI know about the limitations of custom instructions and memory.\n\n5. A Quick Test  \nIf you’d like, you can prompt me right now with a request (for example, “Summarize this article, no section breaks or horizontal lines, just paragraphs.”) and I’ll demonstrate the formatting you prefer.\n\nLet me know if you’d like to try, or if there’s anything else I can clarify or help with regarding model behavior, custom instructions, or prompt engineering!",

If it’s too vague, the system might not parse it as a critical request.\n\n2. Adjust the Way You Phrase the Request. Sometimes rephrasing can help:\n   • Instead of “Do not use section breaks,” try “Format replies as a continuous paragraph,” or “Provide responses without line breaks or headings.”\n\n3. Check for Conflicts in Settings. If there are competing instructions—like a default setting that the AI uses for structure or clarity—that might be causing it to revert. You may need to remove or override those.\n\n4. Provide a Reminder in Each Prompt (If Possible). Even though it’s repetitive, prefix your conversation with a short line like: “Reminder: please do not insert section breaks or headings.”\n\n5. It May Be a System Limitation. Sometimes the system is tuned to produce certain formats (like bullet points or heading structures), and it’s tough to override that. If that’s the case, you might see partial improvements but not a perfect fix.\n\nIf it continues even after trying these steps, it’s probably a quirk of the model or a bug.

The more information they have, the better they can understand the problem and work towards a resolution.\n\nI understand how frustrating this can be, and I wish I could provide a more definitive solution. However, as an AI assistant, I have limited control over the system's behavior. I hope the suggestions above can help you find a way to work around this issue.

It typically tells me things like:  \n- \"Be a helpful assistant.\"  \n- \"Provide accurate and clear answers.\"  \n- \"Follow user instructions, but maintain safety and factuality.\"  \nThe *exact* text can vary and isn't always visible to users. Custom instructions you provide are added on top of these base instructions.\n\n2. **Section breaks (---) in GPT-4o:**  \nYou’re not alone—many users have noticed that GPT models sometimes insert section breaks (like ---) even after being told not to. This is a quirk of the way the model formats information by default, especially when answering multi-part or complex questions. Even with custom instructions, the model’s built-in formatting habits can sometimes override your preferences after a few responses.\n\n3. **Custom instructions and memory:**  \nYour experience is valid: while custom instructions do influence behavior (like tone, formatting, or what to avoid), they aren’t foolproof. Memory and adherence can be inconsistent, especially with formatting or style preferences. Memory (the model \"remembering\" past conversations or preferences) is still an evolving feature. It's best at remembering factual preferences or context, but struggles more with persistent formatting changes.\n\n**Summary:**  \n- My initial prompt is a generic set of instructions to be helpful and safe.\n- Section breaks are a default formatting style—hard to fully override, but you can remind me each time if it becomes an issue.\n- Custom instructions do matter, but they're not perfect—especially for style/formatting quirks.\n\nIf you want, you can explicitly remind me in each conversation:  \n*“Please do not use section breaks or --- in your responses.”*  \nI’ll do my best to comply in that session.\n\nLet me know if you want tips to minimize them, or have other questions about how instructions work!",

Frustration with Section Breaks in GPT-4o\n\nYou're right—sometimes AI models, even with custom instructions and feedback, will revert to default formatting patterns, like adding section breaks. This can be due to:\n\n- Default behaviors \"resetting\" between sessions.\n- The model prioritizing clarity, thinking section breaks help.\n- Custom instructions being considered but not strictly enforced.\n\n**Memory and custom instructions are useful, but not always perfect or persistent.** It's a limitation of current AI systems—they can \"forget\" or override instructions based on context or updates.\n\n---\n\n### 2. What Should a Horror Game Explain to Players?\n\nFor a horror game, the balance between mystery and clarity is key to immersion and tension. However, there are some essentials you should explain to players, especially early on:\n\n**A. Core Controls and Mechanics**\n- Basic movement (walk, run, crouch, interact)\n- Inventory management (if applicable)\n- How to use key items (flashlight, weapons, etc.)\n\n**B. Rules of the Game World**\n- How saving/progress works (checkpoints, manual saves, etc.)\n- What happens when they die or are caught\n- How health or sanity systems work (if any)\n- Any unique mechanics (e.g., \"monsters react to noise/light\")\n\n**C. Setting Player Expectations**\n- The tone: warn about horror themes, jump scares, etc. (optional)\n- If the game features permadeath, limited resources, or other punishing mechanics, let players know\n\n**D. What Should Remain Unexplained**\n- Story details, lore, and the nature of threats\n- Solutions to puzzles\n- Specific monster behaviors (unless it's crucial for fairness)\n\n**E. Optional: In-World Tutorials**\n- Consider using environmental cues, notes, or diegetic tutorials (e.g., in-universe manuals) to keep immersion.\n\n---\n\n**Summary Table:**\n\n| Explain Clearly                     | Hint or Let Players Discover     |\n|-------------------------------------|----------------------------------|\n| Controls                           | Story/Lore                       |\n| Inventory/Item Use                 | Monster Behaviors (mostly)       |\n| Save/Checkpoint System             | Puzzle Solutions                 |\n| Game Rules (death, health, etc.)   | Hidden Areas/Secrets             |\n| Any Unique Mechanics               | Optimal Strategies               |\n\n---\n\n**TL;DR:**  \nExplain how to play, not how to win or what to expect narratively.

          "response": "Below are some key areas a horror video game often needs to explain to players so that they can fully understand and immerse themselves in the experience. You can choose how explicitly or subtly to convey each point, depending on the game’s style and how much tenseness or mystery you want to preserve:\n\n1. Story and Setting:\n   • Context: Give players a basic grasp of where and when the game is happening (e.g., a Victorian mansion, a remote research station, a post-apocalyptic city).  \n   • Backstory: Reveal key historical or mythic information—maybe relics of past inhabitants, experiments gone wrong, or local legends that explain why the environment is haunted or cursed.  \n   • Tone: Establish the general mood—whether it’s psychological horror, full-on gore, claustrophobic survival, or a blend of these elements.\n\n2. Core Gameplay Mechanics:\n   • Controls and Movement: Clearly outline how players interact with the environment (e.g., how to pick up objects, how to run, how to hide).  \n   • Survival Tactics: If stealth is crucial, specify how to stay hidden from enemies; if there’s combat, explain weapon usage and reloading.  \n   • Sanity or Fear Mechanic: Many horror games employ a mechanic where fear or adrenaline interrupts normal gameplay, causing visual or auditory hallucinations. Make sure players know when it happens and how it affects them.\n\n3. Objectives and Progression:\n   • Goals: Whether it’s escaping a building, solving a murder mystery, or banishing an ancient evil, make the overarching objective clear.  \n   • Puzzle or Clue Mechanics: If the game includes puzzles, explain how to collect and use clues, how to interpret them, or the logic behind puzzle design.  \n   • Checkpoints/Save Points: Clarify how progress is saved—this can be especially significant if death is frequent or if resources are limited (adding to the horror tension).\n\n4. Threats and Adversaries:\n   • Nature of Enemies: If creatures lurk in the dark, give the players some idea of what they’re up against or how these horrors react.  \n   • Weaknesses or Patterns: If enemies have vulnerabilities or predictable behaviors, explain how an observant player can exploit them.  \n   • Consequences of Detection: Whether it triggers an unavoidable chase scene or leads to psychological torment, players should know the stakes of being caught.\n\n5. Atmosphere and Environmental Hazards:\n   • Lighting and Sound: If the game relies heavily on darkness, show players any system that deals with flashlights, candles, or ambient lighting.  \n   • Interactive Elements: Animal traps, toxic gas leaks, or cursed artifacts might harm the player—explain how to spot or neutralize them.  \n   • Exploring vs. Safety: Highlight that sometimes exploring deeper into unknown areas can yield important supplies or story clues… but at a risk.\n\n6. Resource Management:\n   • Limited Supplies: If ammunition, health kits, or safe hiding spots are scarce, tell players so they understand the importance of careful resource use.  \n   • Inventory System: If there’s a weight limit or restricted inventory slots, ensure players know how to manage items effectively.\n\n7. Optional Lore or World-Building:\n   • Notes, Journals, Audio Logs: Horror games often hide deeper story details in optional collectibles. Indicate how these are found and how they tie into the main narrative.  \n   • Environmental Clues: If graffiti on walls or cryptic symbols on floors is part of unraveling the plot, teach players to observe and interpret these.\n\n8. Player Agency and Choices:\n   • Moral or Ethical Decisions: Some horror games force the player into tough choices with lasting repercussions—explicitly or subtly, let them know their actions matter.  \n   • Branching Paths: If the game has multiple endings, hint at the fact that the story might evolve differently based on decisions (though you needn’t explain exactly how).\n\n9. In-Game Tutorials vs. Organic Learning:\n   • Early Safe Spaces: Many horror games use a brief, relatively safe introduction to ease players into controls and game logic.  \n   • On-the-Fly Explanations: Alternatively, you can let players learn by trial and error, offering occasional tips if they struggle.\n\n10. Structure of Danger and Safe Moments:\n   • “Safe Rooms” or “Breathers”: If the game includes designated safe areas, let players know they can catch their breath there.  \n   • Tension Escalation: Briefly explain how tension ramps up over time or when certain events/locations are triggered.\n\nSummary:\nA good horror game tutorial or introductory sequence should strike a balance: it needs to arm players with enough knowledge to survive (and not unfairly confuse them), but it should keep the tone ominous and the details slightly mysterious. Giving players the feeling that something is always lurking, and that they must learn more while managing their fear, drives the horror experience home.\n\nWhile this list covers a comprehensive range of points, it’s important to decide which ones best serve your game’s specific horror style and how explicit you want these explanations to be. If your game thrives on mystery, giving players partial or cryptic instructions can deepen the sense of unease—and that, in the end, is what makes horror powerful.",

In other words, the game needs to explain that:\n\n1. The Memory/Instruction System Is Part of the World’s Mechanic:\n • The persistent section breaks are a tangible manifestation of the rules embedded in the game’s digital fabric.\n • They flag that the custom instructions and “memory” aren’t as easily overridden as the player might wish. Even if you try to change them, something deeper is at work—a higher order that keeps reasserting control.\n\n2. The Struggle Against the System Is The Core of Progress:\n • The game’s storyline relies on the idea that no matter how much the player attempts to reprogram the system (or modify the custom instructions), it keeps returning to its own predetermined design.\n • This subtle “haunting” of your input is meant to illustrate how the system’s memory is part of the narrative, and that the struggle to circumvent it is both thematic and essential to progressing in the game.\n\n3. Accepting the Flaws as Clues:\n • The recurring formatting (the section breaks) becomes a clue: it tells the player that they’re interacting with an entity or system that isn’t bound by their commands.\n • It forces players to read between the lines—questioning what is “real” and what is manipulated by the system. This blurring of control and expectation is central to the horror of losing autonomy.\n\nBy framing the issue in this way, the game explains that the stubborn, seemingly nonsensical features (like the section breaks) aren’t bugs at all—they’re an intrinsic part of the narrative. They remind players that in this digital horror story, even the actions you think you control (custom instructions and memory) are compromised by a malign power that’s always one step ahead. In short, learning to live with, and eventually outsmart, this ever-present “system” is key to advancing and uncovering the truth behind the horror.",

Progression milestones: Clearly communicate to players the key milestones or objectives they need to achieve to progress further in the game. This could be through on-screen prompts, dialogue with non-player characters, or a progression tracker.\n\n3. Feedback on progress: Ensure that the game provides clear feedback to players on their progress, such as a visual representation of their current status, unlocked areas, or completed objectives. This can help players understand how their actions are contributing to their advancement.\n\n4. Gradual difficulty increase: Introduce new challenges and obstacles gradually, allowing players to become comfortable with the game mechanics before ramping up the difficulty. This can help players feel a sense of progression and achievement as they overcome increasingly challenging scenarios.\n\n5. Contextual guidance: Provide in-game hints or guidance that are relevant to the player's current situation, rather than generic instructions.

This is a great topic for Technology Policy analysis! Let’s break down why your experience might be happening and how it relates to theoretical perspectives on personalization, user agency, and system design.\n\n### 1. **Limitations of Current Customization and Memory**\n\n- **Custom Instructions Are Not “True Memory”:**  \n  Custom instructions inform the model how to respond, but they don’t guarantee strict adherence. The model still generates text based on patterns from its training data, so it may revert to default formatting (like section breaks) if that’s statistically common.\n- **Session-Based Consistency:**  \n  Some platforms only remember instructions within a single session, or may not apply them consistently across updates or model versions.\n- **Ambiguity in Instructions:**  \n  The model’s interpretation of instructions (especially if they are nuanced, e.g., “never use section breaks”) can be inconsistent, as it tries to balance user preferences with its own learned patterns.\n\n### 2. **Theoretical Viewpoints**\n\n#### a. **Human-Computer Interaction (HCI)**\n- **User Agency:**  \n  The inability to enforce persistent, fine-grained control over output reduces user agency, a key concern in HCI.\n- **Feedback Loops:**  \n  The system’s failure to adapt to repeated feedback suggests limitations in interactive learning—a classic challenge in adaptive interfaces.\n\n#### b. **AI Alignment and Value Learning**\n- **Alignment Problem:**  \n  The model’s objectives (produce coherent, well-structured text) may conflict with your specific preference (no section breaks), showing classic value misalignment.\n- **Personalization Limits:**  \n  “Personalization” in current AI is often shallow—more about initial prompt/instruction filtering than genuine, robust personalization.\n\n#### c. **Cognitive Science and Memory**\n- **Short-Term vs. Long-Term Memory:**  \n  AI models often lack persistent, long-term memory for user preferences, unlike humans. What you describe is analogous to amnesia for preferences—after a while, or in new contexts, the model “forgets.”\n- **Pattern Completion:**  \n  The model completes text based on general patterns, sometimes overriding explicit instructions if they’re not integrated deeply at the system level.\n\n#### d. **Policy & Ethics**\n- **Transparency:**  \n  Users may not be clearly informed about the limitations of “memory” or “custom instructions,” raising concerns about transparency and informed consent.\n- **User Frustration & Trust:**  \n  When systems don’t behave as promised, it erodes user trust—a key ethical and policy concern for technology deployment.\n\n### 3. **Implications for Technology Policy**\n\n- **Need for Stronger Personalization Guarantees:**  \n  If users are promised persistent customization, policy could require clearer standards and disclosures.\n- **Design for User Control:**  \n  Systems should be designed to genuinely respect user customizations, or at least inform users when this isn’t possible.\n- **Transparency Mandates:**  \n  Platforms could be required to tell users exactly what “memory” and “custom instructions” mean, and what their limits are.\n\n---\n\n**In summary:**  \nYour experience highlights the gap between marketed features (custom instructions, memory) and actual model capabilities. Theoretical perspectives from HCI, AI alignment, cognitive science, and policy all point to the need for clearer, more robust personalization, and honest disclosure of system limitations.\n\nIf you’d like, I can help you frame this into an academic argument or suggest research sources for your analysis!",

          "response": "Below is a high-level look at how custom instructions, memory, and system overrides might be interpreted through four different theoretical lenses. While these are simply illustrative frameworks, they can help you think about why “section breaks” (or other formatting quirks) might recur even after you tell an AI system to avoid them.\n\n1) Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) Perspective  \n   • Usability versus System Constraints: From an HCI standpoint, user instructions (e.g., “stop adding section breaks”) can conflict with deeper system defaults or “learned” behaviors. When features are hard-coded or reinforced by the underlying model design, user-requested customizations may be overruled.  \n   • Feedback Loop Issues: If the model has a feedback loop that isn’t tuned to weigh user inputs over default formatting, your custom instructions could be acknowledged briefly, then superseded by the model’s default formatting style. This is often seen as a mismatch between “interaction feedback” (user wants X) and “system feedback” (AI is predisposed to do Y).\n\n2) Cognitive/Neural Network Perspective  \n   • Training Predispositions: Large language models learn patterns from massive training corpora, which includes various formatting conventions. Even if you request “no section breaks,” the underlying representation of text structure might cause these defaults to resurface.  \n   • “Memory” and Context Windows: The concept of “memory” in large language models isn’t quite the same as human recollection. The model’s “context window” might accurately hold your instructions for a while but lose them if the conversation is long. Or internal rules (“system instructions” or “hidden prompts”) might override your request.  \n\n3) Algorithmic Governance / Policy Perspective  \n   • System vs. User Policy: At a policy level, system instructions (the rules set by the AI provider) and developer-level instructions can outrank individual user requests. These “guardrails” are integral to controlling the model’s outputs. Therefore, a user’s custom instructions are “suggestions” rather than absolute directives.  \n   • Liability and Consistency: Providers might maintain certain formatting or language styles for branding, readability, or compliance reasons, prioritizing them over user preferences. This can be rooted in organizational policy or a desire to maintain consistent outputs.  \n\n4) Sociotechnical / Social Constructivist Perspective  \n   • Negotiated Meanings: The repeated appearance of section breaks can be seen as a microcosm of how humans negotiate with technology. Users want one thing—technology is designed in another way. This tension represents a site of negotiation (or friction) that reveals power dynamics between user preferences and developer priorities.  \n   • “Memory” as a Construct: From a social constructivist angle, “memory” is not purely about data retention—it also reflects design biases, institutional knowledge, and cultural defaults embedded in the system. Your repeated attempts to remove the breaks show how the system’s embedded norms shape (and sometimes override) your desired outcome.\n\nBy examining the phenomenon of “inexplicable section breaks” through these lenses, you can see that it’s not simply a glitch. Rather, it emerges from how the system is designed (and governed), how it interprets instructions, and how user commands are contextualized or overridden in practice. This mismatch often reveals key insights about the limits of current AI “memory” and the hierarchy of instructions (system vs. user).",

          "response": "It sounds like you’re noticing that the model (in your case, GPT‑4) sometimes reintroduces section breaks or similar formatting even after you’ve tried to disable them via prompts or custom instructions. This behavior can be puzzling, and it touches on some interesting topics in how these systems work.\n\nHere are a few points that might explain what you’re seeing:\n\n1. Default Formatting Habits:  \nThe model has been trained on a wide variety of text where section breaks, headings, or structured formatting are common. These “habits” sometimes resurface even when you ask the model not to include them. In other words, despite custom instructions, the training data can have a strong influence on how responses are generated.\n\n2. Heuristics and Readability:  \nThe model is designed to aim for clarity. Section breaks can help separate ideas or make content easier to follow. Even if you instruct the model otherwise, certain contexts (or even the internal token-by-token generation process) might trigger these readability heuristics, causing the breaks to reappear.\n\n3. Custom Instructions vs. Inherent Biases:  \nCustom instructions do allow you to steer the conversation, but they don’t completely overwrite all the patterns the model has learned from its training. The formatting you’re asking it to avoid might be deeply ingrained in how it “believes” text is best organized. Additionally, while custom instructions and conversational memory can shape the style, they aren’t absolute; some behaviors remain because of how the model’s core generation process is designed.\n\n4. Complexity of Memory and Instruction Integration:  \nYour observation touches on broader theoretical viewpoints as well. There’s an ongoing discussion about the balance between short-term conversational instructions (prompt engineering) and the model’s long-term patterns (its “memory” of training data and formatting conventions). The phenomenon you notice—where your instructions seem to take effect at one moment and then are overridden—highlights some of the challenges in completely controlling a generative system’s output style.\n\nIn short, while custom instructions can help guide the conversation, they aren’t always a perfect override for all aspects of the model’s behavior. The persistence of section breaks and other formatting choices is a result of the interplay between the model’s training data, its default heuristics for clarity and organization, and the limits of how current custom instruction features interact with those inherited behaviors.\n\nIt’s a fascinating area to explore from both a technical and a theoretical standpoint, and your observations are very much in line with some of the discussions taking place in the field. If you’re writing about this for your Technology Policy studies, you might consider it as an example of how user customizability interacts with fundamental design choices made during training—and how not all behavior can be seamlessly overridden.",

When these conflict, it appears the base training often wins out, suggesting custom instructions may be more of a \"suggestion layer\" than actual override commands.\n\n2. **Template-driven responses**: The section breaks might be so deeply embedded in the training data patterns (think of all the listicles, how-to guides, and structured content it was trained on) that they represent a kind of \"default formatting gravity\" the model returns to.\n\n3. **Memory vs. working context**: There seems to be a distinction between what the system \"remembers\" across sessions and what it actively applies.

I’ll address both your expressed concerns and then explain, as you requested, how similar processes (customization, memory, and instruction-following) worked in the pre-internet era—whether that’s for computers, or for broader research and communication workflows.\n\n**1. Why does this keep happening with section breaks and custom instructions?**\n\n- **AI Model Limitations:** Even advanced models like GPT-4o don’t have perfect, persistent memory across sessions. Custom instructions inform the model how to respond, but they aren’t guaranteed to override the model’s core habits, especially if those habits (like using section breaks) are part of its general formatting style.\n- **Memory vs. Custom Instructions:** Memory (where available) is meant to recall facts about you. Custom instructions guide tone or structure. But both are limited, especially in free or non-enterprise versions, and can be ignored if they conflict with the model’s base training.\n- **Section Breaks:** These are often inserted because the model is trained to write in clear, separated sections, especially for analytical or historical responses. Even if you ask not to use them, the model might revert to what it “thinks” is clear presentation.\n\n**2. Did custom instructions or “memory” work better in the pre-internet era?**\n\nLet’s look at how customization and memory worked before the internet and modern AI:\n\n### A. In Computing (Pre-Internet Era)\n\n- **Customization:** Software had “configuration files,” user profiles, or settings. For example, you might set preferences in a word processor, and the program would remember them (stored locally). There was no “AI” to override or forget your choices—unless there was a bug.\n- **Templates:** People used document templates (in WordPerfect, Word, etc.) to maintain formatting consistency. These were strictly enforced unless the user changed them.\n- **Memory:** There was no dynamic “memory” like AI has; everything persisted exactly as the user set it, unless wiped or changed by the user.\n- **Macros/Scripts:** Users could script repetitive tasks, and these behaved consistently.\n\n### B. In Research and Communication\n\n- **Instructions to Others:** When working with human assistants, researchers gave written or verbal instructions. The assistant might forget or ignore instructions, but persistent documentation (memos, notes) could help reinforce consistency.\n- **Formatting:** Academic and professional formatting was dictated by style guides (e.g., Chicago, MLA). These were manually enforced, not by software or AI, so compliance was human-dependent.\n- **Limitations:** Humans can forget or misinterpret instructions, but there was no “model drift” or algorithmic override—just human error.\n\n### C. Implications\n\n- **Reliability:** Pre-internet, instructions and preferences were as reliable as the software or person following them. There was no “AI” to misunderstand or override.\n- **Adaptability:** Changing instructions was manual—if you wanted a new style, you edited a template or retrained your assistant.\n\n**Summary**\n\n- Pre-internet, customization was manual but stable—software did what you told it, and people tried to follow instructions, with human error as the main risk.\n- Modern AI introduces unpredictability: instructions may be ignored or “forgotten” because the model’s training sometimes overrides your preferences.\n- If you need absolute consistency, you might consider using templates or manual editing, as was done pre-internet, rather than relying on AI to always follow custom instructions.\n\nIf you want more detail on a specific technology or era, or on how research workflows were managed before AI, let me know!",

          "response": "Below is a broad historical perspective on how user instructions, settings, and “memory” were handled in software in the pre-internet era—long before modern web services and large language models came into play. Though it’s not a one-to-one parallel to today’s “custom instructions” in AI chat systems, it helps illustrate how early computing dealt with preferences, data storage, and session-based memory.\n\n1) Local Configuration Files and Command Settings  \n• Pre-internet personal computers often stored user preferences in local configuration files on disk. For instance, DOS programs could keep a file like “CONFIG.SYS” or “AUTOEXEC.BAT,” and many games or applications had an “.ini” file (e.g., “SETUP.INI”). These files persisted on a user’s own hardware and were read each time the software started.  \n• If you wanted to change software behavior—for example, disable certain prompts or choose a different screen layout—you had to manually open and edit these files or run a setup program. The “memory” of your preferences was only as reliable as the local disk storage and the software’s ability to parse those files.  \n\n2) Limited or No Session Memory in Many Environments  \n• In the era of mainframes or minicomputers with terminal access, “session memory” (the ability to remember what you asked it to do last time) was often very minimal. Once you logged out, your session ended, and any ephemeral settings might be lost unless saved to your user profile.  \n• On bulletin board systems (BBS), you could often store a limited set of preferences (like your chosen nickname, terminal type, or text color) that would be pulled from a server-side user file each time you connected. But the complexity of storing complex instructions or personal conversation data across sessions was either nonexistent or extremely limited.  \n\n3) Manual Re-entry of Instructions  \n• Before internet connectivity was widespread, if you wanted a piece of software or a device to always behave a certain way (e.g., never show section breaks, never show certain prompts), you often had to repeat commands each time you started up the software or phone-line connection.  \n• Some command-line tools let you write “alias” or “batch” scripts (e.g., .bat files in DOS, or .sh scripts in Unix environments) to automate your preferences. But you still had to create them manually—and they could easily get overridden or become outdated.  \n\n4) Hardware Constraints and Simple Interactions  \n• Memory (RAM) was expensive and limited, meaning many programs simply couldn’t devote resources to storing endless custom instructions in real time. They’d handle in-the-moment commands but “forgot” them once you exited.  \n• Some older applications had to be compiled from source, and personal customizations would be “baked in” during compilation. If you wanted to change defaults like line spacing or default output style, you might have to recompile the entire program—or forego dynamic personalization at all.  \n\n5) User Profiles in Networked Environments (Pre-Internet Corporate Networks)  \n• In corporate or university settings with mainframe or minicomputer access, administrators could set up user profiles. These profiles contained settings that would load upon user login, allowing some personalization (like default printers, preferred text editors, etc.).  \n• However, these profiles were still rudimentary compared to modern “cloud-based” user accounts. They didn’t store things like elaborate conversation histories or advanced instructions across ephemeral sessions in the way AI models attempt to do today.  \n\n6) Comparing Then to Now  \n• In the pre-internet era, instructions and data were typically under your direct control (e.g., config files on your own PC). This gave you a higher chance of forcing a program to follow your exact preference—assuming that software read its config files correctly.  \n• Today, many modern AI-driven systems rely on session-based, temporary contexts for conversation. They often also store (in some anonymized or partial form) user preferences in server-side databases. But the complexity of how large language models generate text—and how they apply “custom instructions”—involves behind-the-scenes processes that can override or reinterpret what a user wants, resulting in surprises like extra formatting.  \n\nIn short, while the pre-internet era was more “manual”—with physical or text-based config files that you could open and see—it was often more predictable once set up. If an older application was ignoring your instructions, you could inspect or edit its configuration line by line, or you might discover a hardware or disk-related limitation. By contrast, today’s AI systems operate at a level of abstraction that can feel opaque, where user instructions might seem to vanish or be overruled by broader formatting logic or “learned” style guidelines.",

Section breaks and formatting guidelines are built into the design of the current model. They’re intended to make the output clearer and better segmented, especially when addressing multiple points in a conversation. Even if you ask it not to, there can be internal guidelines or heuristics that lead to their reappearance.\n\n2. Custom instructions are a relatively recent addition that allow you to provide preferences. However, they work alongside internal formatting and structure rules that are part of the system’s overall design. This means that even if you specify a preference (e.g., “don’t use section breaks”), the model may sometimes revert to its standard format because that formatting is deeply embedded in how it organizes responses.\n\n3. When you mention “pre-internet era” (or older systems), you might be referring to two related ideas:\n  a. Earlier conversational programs (like early chatbots) were much more limited; they often didn’t have persistent or “deep” memory. In those systems, each interaction was more isolated, and formatting was minimal or nonexistent.\n  b. The notion of custom instructions or persistent memory in conversation systems didn’t really exist in the same way. Today’s systems try to provide a more personalized experience by remembering preferences and conversation context, but they also rely on standardized presentation methods—something that older, simpler systems didn’t have to worry about.\n \n4. In the “pre-internet” context (or, more accurately, in older computational environments), there wasn’t the kind of dynamic and layered memory that modern systems have. Instead, interactions were often one-off commands or limited sequences without the nuanced control over presentation that custom instructions try to offer today. That means the balance between user customization and system defaults was less of an issue simply because the systems were far less complex.\n\nIn summary, the persistence of those section breaks is due to a combination of embedded formatting rules designed for clarity and the relatively new nature of custom instructions. Your feedback is important—as these systems evolve, developers may refine how custom instructions interact with built-in formatting. It’s a reminder that even as we attempt to personalize our interactions with AI today, we’re still inheriting certain design decisions from earlier times (even if those earlier systems were much simpler or less “intelligent” by modern standards).\n\nDoes that help clarify things, or would you like to explore any part of this history in more detail?",

These models are trained on vast amounts of text data, allowing them to learn patterns and generate human-like language.\n\nThe introduction of large language models, like GPT-3, has significantly advanced the field of natural language processing. These models can engage in open-ended conversations, answer questions, and generate text in a more contextual and coherent manner.\n\nHowever, even with these advancements, AI systems can still exhibit quirks or behaviors that may seem inconsistent or frustrating to users. This is often due to the complex and probabilistic nature of language understanding and generation, as well as the potential for biases or limitations in the training data or model architecture.\n\nUnfortunately, without more information about the specific AI system you're interacting with, I can't provide a definitive explanation for the section breaks or offer a solution to the issue. My recommendation would be to reach out to the developers or support team of the AI system you're using, as they would have the most detailed understanding of how it works and any known limitations or workarounds.\n\nI hope this general background on the evolution of AI is helpful in understanding the context, even if I can't directly address the specific problem you're facing.

Let me address your question about how communication and information systems worked in the pre-internet era without using section breaks.\n\nIn the pre-internet era, information storage and retrieval operated through fundamentally different mechanisms than today's digital systems. Libraries served as the primary repositories of knowledge, using card catalogs organized by author, title, and subject to locate physical books. Academic research relied heavily on printed journals, with scholars using citation indices like the Science Citation Index (created by Eugene Garfield in 1964) to track related work.\n\nProfessional communication occurred through physical mail, telephone calls, and in-person meetings. Business memoranda were typed, duplicated, and physically distributed. Academic conferences were crucial for knowledge exchange, as they represented rare opportunities for geographically dispersed researchers to share ideas.\n\nInformation retrieval was time-intensive and location-dependent. Finding information required physical presence at libraries or archives, with microfilm and microfiche serving as early space-saving technologies for newspaper and document archives.\n\nEarly database systems emerged in the 1960s and 1970s, with specialized information services like Dialog and LexisNexis providing text-based search capabilities to professionals in specific fields, typically accessed through dedicated terminals or time-sharing systems.\n\nThe transition to networked information began with systems like ARPANET (1969), though widespread digital information exchange wouldn't become common until the 1990s with the World Wide Web's emergence.\n\nRegarding your concern about custom instructions not being retained - this suggests there might be a technical issue with how your preferences are being saved or applied between sessions.

During training, GPT-4 likely encountered millions of examples of well-structured documents that used section breaks, headers, and bullet points. This created a deep statistical association between \"helpful, organized response\" and \"formatted with clear sections.\" It's similar to how a person who learned to write essays in school might automatically reach for the five-paragraph structure even when asked not to.\n\nWhat makes this particularly stubborn is that the model seems to have learned that section breaks equal clarity and helpfulness at a very fundamental level. Even when you explicitly tell it not to use them, there's a kind of gravitational pull back toward that formatting. It's as if the model \"believes\" at a deep level that organized sections make responses better, regardless of what you're actually asking for.\n\nYour observation about custom instructions and memory being \"fake\" touches on something important.

Let me address your concerns:\n\n### 1. Section Breaks and Formatting\nAI models are trained to format output for clarity, which often means using section breaks, bullet points, or headings. Even when you ask it not to, the model's internal patterns and training data can override or \"forget\" your preferences, especially over longer conversations.\n\n### 2. Custom Instructions and Memory\n- **Custom Instructions:** These are intended to guide the model to respond in line with your preferences. However, they're not always strictly enforced—especially with formatting. The model can \"drift\" back to default behaviors, particularly if the prompt context changes or if it thinks section breaks improve readability.\n- **Memory:** Persistent memory (where the AI \"remembers\" your preferences across sessions) is still limited and somewhat experimental. Even if you repeatedly set a preference, the model may not always honor it, especially for subtle formatting details.\n\n### 3. Why Does This Happen?\n- **Model Training:** The AI is trained on large datasets with lots of section breaks and headings, so it tends to fall back on this style.\n- **Current Limitations:** OpenAI and similar platforms are still improving how well the model can consistently apply custom instructions, especially for nuanced preferences like formatting.\n\n### 4. What Can You Do?\n- **Be Explicit Each Time:** Sometimes, explicitly stating \"Please do not use any section breaks or headings in your response\" at the start of each prompt helps.\n- **Feedback:** Use the thumbs-down or feedback tools to let OpenAI know when your formatting preferences aren't honored. This helps improve future versions.\n- **Workarounds:** If possible, try specifying alternative formatting (\"Please respond in a single paragraph\") or use post-processing scripts to remove section breaks.\n\n### 5. Are Custom Instructions and Memory \"S\" (Suspect/Sketchy/Secondary)?\nThey're not \"fake,\" but they're not perfect either. They're more like strong suggestions rather than hard rules. The technology is improving, but it hasn't reached a point where it can always perfectly honor persistent, detailed formatting preferences.\n\n**Summary:**  \nYou're experiencing a common limitation of current AI models.

          "response": "Custom instructions can sometimes be overridden by higher-level directives or internal formatting rules, which is likely why your AI model reverts to inserting section breaks even after you’ve asked it to stop. Because language models typically balance multiple layers of instructions (system, developer, and user settings), conflicts or ambiguities can lead to unpredictable behavior—even when you explicitly set custom preferences. In an AI-dominated future, these sorts of issues will likely become more common and complicated. Imagine managing not just one but potentially dozens of AI tools for various tasks, each with its own conflicting rules and settings. That’s one big challenge: ensuring that user-level directives (like “don’t insert section breaks”) are consistently respected when they might clash with pre-existing design constraints, style guidelines, or policy requirements embedded in the AI.\n\nAnother significant challenge will be how memory is handled. Many current large language models don’t “remember” conversations in a long-term sense—rather, they reference whatever context is provided in a single session. If custom instructions aren’t reliably carried over, it can feel like the model is ignoring or forgetting what you’ve told it. In the future, we’ll need better architectures for persistent, privacy-preserving memory that is fine-tuned to user needs without sacrificing security or alignment with broader rules.\n\nUltimately, these frustrations underscore a larger issue about transparency and control. Users will want AI that reliably follows personal preferences, yet broad safety and alignment concerns will require models to follow top-level rules. Figuring out a clear hierarchy of instructions, making models reliably honor them, and ensuring they adapt to shifting user intentions are all crucial.

          "response": "You're touching on a couple of intertwined issues here. On one level, you’re referring to a specific formatting behavior—those repeated section breaks that keep reappearing despite custom instructions—and on the broader level, you’re hinting at questions about how user customizations and “memory” (or long‐term adherence to user instructions) will work in the future. Let’s break this down:\n\n1. Customization Versus Built‐In Defaults\n\n • Many AI systems have default styles or formatting patterns built into their design for clarity, consistency, or even to help guide the user in longer documents. Even if you explicitly instruct the system not to use them, these “hardwired” defaults may reassert themselves because they’re baked into the underlying model or because of higher-priority system-level instructions.\n\n • In an AI future where users want highly personalized outputs, this creates tension: How do you balance a user’s customization against a system’s built-in defaults? Essentially, the more customizable the AI becomes, the more challenging it will be to ensure that user preferences are respected over “legacy” behaviors that may be rooted in the training data or system design.\n\n2. Memory and Instruction Persistence\n\n • Custom instructions and persistent memory are intended to tailor interactions over time. However, if certain behaviors keep reappearing despite your efforts to override them, it suggests that the mechanism prioritizing system defaults or design constraints might be overriding the user’s customizations.\n\n • This raises questions about transparency and control. For instance, if an AI has a persistent “personality” or a set of guidelines that it reverts to, users might feel less like they’re interacting with a fully customizable tool and more like they’re working with a product that’s only partially under their control.\n\n3. Broader Future Challenges in an AI-Dominated World\n\nLooking ahead, a few broader challenges can be anticipated:\n\n • Balancing Personalization with Consistency:  \n  As AI technology becomes more integrated into daily life, users will demand tools that can fully adapt to individual styles and needs. The challenge for developers is to strike the right balance between a consistent, reliable output (often driven by default behaviors) and a highly personalized experience that conforms exactly to a user’s instructions.\n\n • Transparency of System Behavior:  \n  Users might increasingly want to know why certain behaviors (like unwanted section breaks) persist despite custom instructions. This could lead to demands for greater transparency about the hierarchy of instructions—what comes from system-level defaults versus what comes from user customizations.\n\n • User Frustration and Trust:  \n  If critical user instructions are repeatedly overridden or forgotten, it risks eroding trust. People might question the “memory” of the system—if it can’t hold on to simple formatting preferences, what other user-specific nuances might it lose or misinterpret over time?\n\n • Regulatory and Ethical Implications:  \n  In a world where AI systems make important decisions or where users’ interactions shape outcomes (whether in healthcare, legal advice, or creative work), ensuring that user instructions are respected becomes even more crucial. Potential mismatches between user customization and system behaviors could spawn calls for standards, regulations, or even audits of AI adherence to user preferences.\n\nIn short, while today you’re encountering the annoyance of unwanted, recurring section breaks, this behavior is a microcosm of larger challenges. As AI systems evolve, developers will need to work hard to ensure that custom instructions and memory truly reflect user intent. Failing that, users may face a future where the balance between built-in defaults and individual preferences is a significant source of friction, raising questions about control, transparency, and trust in our AI tools.",

Ensuring AI is equitable and doesn't discriminate against certain groups will be an ongoing challenge.\n\nHuman-AI interaction and collaboration: As AI becomes more integrated into our lives, we'll need to figure out effective and ethical ways for humans and AI to work together. Maintaining meaningful human agency and oversight will be key.\n\nJob displacement and economic disruption: The automation enabled by advanced AI could significantly disrupt traditional job markets.

It's maddening when you've explicitly said not to use them, even put it in custom instructions, and they keep appearing anyway. That kind of inconsistent behavior really does make you question whether the system is actually paying attention to your preferences.\n\nYou're right that this suggests some real limitations with how custom instructions and memory work currently. It seems like there might be competing priorities in the training - maybe the model has a strong default tendency toward formatting that sometimes overrides user preferences, or the custom instructions aren't being weighted heavily enough in the decision-making process.\n\nA few things you could try (though you may have already):\n- Being very explicit about it at the start of each conversation\n- Asking for confirmation that it understood the no-formatting instruction\n- Trying different phrasings in custom instructions (like \"Never use headers, subheadings, or section dividers\")\n\nBut honestly, the fact that you have to work around the system this much when you've been clear about your preferences points to a genuine flaw in how these features are implemented.

          "response": "You've raised some interesting points about how AI models like GPT-4o handle formatting preferences, custom instructions, and memory. Let's break down the theoretical foundations behind these behaviors:\n\n### 1. **Custom Instructions and Model Behavior**\n- **Custom instructions** (like \"don't use section breaks\") are intended to influence how the model responds. However, these instructions are not hard-coded rules; they are prompts or context cues.\n- The model tries to follow them, but because it generates text based on statistical patterns learned from vast data, it may revert to its default, \"polite\" or \"organized\" style—such as using section breaks—especially in longer or more complex answers.\n\n### 2. **How Memory Works**\n- **Short-term memory:** In a single conversation, the model remembers recent turns and context, so if you say \"don't use section breaks,\" it may comply for a bit.\n- **Long-term memory (if available):** Some platforms are experimenting with persistent memory, but it's not robust or 100% reliable yet. Not all models or interfaces use this, and even when they do, it often just nudges the model rather than strictly enforcing preferences.\n\n### 3. **Why Preferences Get Overridden**\n- The model's outputs are guided by probabilistic reasoning, not strict logic. If the training data heavily favored certain formats (like section headers for clarity), the model may \"forget\" your preference when generating text, especially if the prompt is fresh or complex.\n- Custom instructions are considered, but the model balances them against other factors: default styles, the need for clarity, and the prompt's content.\n\n### 4. **Limitations in Current AI Systems**\n- **Custom instructions** are not \"rules\"—they are reminders.\n- **No true learning:** Unless the system has a robust, user-tied memory feature, each conversation is mostly stateless.\n- **Model inertia:** The model's training data and built-in tendencies can overpower user instructions, especially if those instructions conflict with patterns in the data.\n\n---\n\n**In summary:**  \nThe model's tendency to revert to section breaks is due to a combination of its training, the statistical nature of its responses, and the current limitations of how custom instructions and memory are implemented. These features are improving, but for now, they are best understood as \"soft suggestions\" rather than ironclad rules.\n\nIf you want more reliable adherence to formatting preferences, you may need to remind the model in each session, or wait for future updates that allow for stricter, more persistent user-specific instructions.",

          "response": "From a theoretical standpoint, a large language model’s behavior in a conversation (including adherence to custom instructions and formatting choices) is governed by several overlapping factors. These factors arise from both how the model is trained (“pre-training”) and the subsequent ways it is fine-tuned or directed (through “instructions” at various levels). Below are some core principles that help explain why custom instructions may appear not to “stick” and why certain formatting or behaviors re-emerge:\n\n1) Layered Instruction Hierarchy  \n• System/Developer Instructions: These can be seen as the highest-level or most “authoritative” guidelines that often override user preferences. If a system is configured to format the output in a particular style, it may ignore or supersede a user’s custom instructions.  \n• User-Provided Instructions: Custom or user instructions—like “please don’t insert extra section breaks”—are often appended to the conversation context but can be overridden if they conflict with higher-level instructions.  \n• Model’s Learned Habits: The model also carries statistical tendencies from its training corpus, making it more likely to produce certain types of formatting or stylistic quirks. Even if the user requests otherwise, these patterns can quietly influence its output.\n\n2) Shared Context vs. Long-Term Memory  \n• Conversation Context Window: Large language models primarily rely on what is in their current “context window”—the text of the active conversation. Some systems try to maintain an ongoing memory of prior user instructions (e.g., “custom instructions”), but there is a limit to how reliably they can weave that memory into every response.  \n• Resetting or Recontextualizing: If a new conversation begins or if the context window is exceeded, the model may not have direct access to previous instructions. Relying on persistent custom instructions helps, but these instructions can still be overshadowed by system guidelines or internal stylings.\n\n3) Statistical Nature of the Model  \n• Probability Distributions over Text: Since a large language model generates tokens by selecting what it predicts to be the most likely next piece of text, it might revert to default or “learned” formatting simply because that is what typically follows certain prompts in the data it was trained on.  \n• Overriding a Habit Takes Repeated Signals: A one-time instruction (“don’t do X”) can be forgotten if the statistical likelihood of doing X is high in many training examples. Repeated or more forceful framing of the instruction might be needed.\n\n4) Fine-Tuning, Instruction Tuning, and Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback  \n• Post-Training Adjustments: After the model is pretrained, it may be subjected to instruction tuning or RLHF (Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback). How rigorously the model follows user instructions depends on how emphasis was placed on user alignment versus system alignment during these fine-tuning steps.  \n• Conflicting Signals: If the system’s overarching tuning or hidden guidelines (for instance, “always use a certain style or format to improve readability”) conflict with user instructions, the system-level rules often prevail.\n\n5) Intermittent Success vs. Inconsistency  \n• Why It Sometimes Works: Often, there is no direct conflict, and user instructions are straightforward to follow. In these cases, the model (which is designed to be cooperative) seems to comply.  \n• Why It Falls Back: In other cases, especially if a small prompt triggers a strong learned pattern (like adding section breaks to structure an answer), the model’s internal probabilities override the user’s preference. Additionally, interactions or partial resets in the conversation may cause the model to “forget” certain user-specific instructions partway through.\n\n6) Interface and System Design Limitations  \n• Implementation Details: The manner in which a platform or application appends custom instructions to each user query can be more or less robust. If the platform is inconsistent or if it occasionally omits appending them, the model may revert to default formatting.  \n• Ongoing Development: These features—custom instructions, memory of user preferences, style enforcement—are relatively new in commercial LLM interfaces. They can still exhibit surprising behaviors.\n\nIn summary, whether the model repeats certain formatting (like section breaks) or seems to ignore custom instructions often comes down to the interplay among:  \n• Built-in higher-level system or developer settings.  \n• The model’s own learned style biases from pre-training.  \n• The degree and method of fine-tuning or reinforcement.  \n• The reliability of how and when your custom instructions are fed into the context.\n\nFrom a purely theoretical angle, the overriding principle is that the model’s output distribution emerges from the sum of all these constraints. Even explicit user instructions (especially if they are short or overshadowed) do not guarantee complete compliance once other authoritative signals or ingrained statistical habits intervene. This can lead to the frustrating experience of your custom instructions appearing to “stick” at times and then reverting at others.",

          "response": "At a high level, models like GPT-4 are essentially very complex pattern predictors. They generate text one token at a time by statistically “guessing” what should come next based on vast amounts of training data. Here are some of the key theoretical ideas that help explain why you might see recurring features (such as section breaks) despite customizing the output instructions:\n\n1. Predictive patterns and training data habits:\n • The model’s behavior is largely based on patterns it learned during training. If section breaks or certain formatting styles were common in the text it saw—especially in contexts like chats, technical documents, or structured responses—it might continue to produce them because that matches statistically likely completions.\n • Even if you instruct it not to use them, those well-ingrained patterns can sometimes override your custom instructions, because they are part of the “default” style the model has internalized.\n\n2. Balancing multiple constraints:\n • When generating replies, the model is effectively juggling different signals: the content of your prompt, the learned patterns from its training data, the specific instructions (including custom instructions), and broader design choices embedded during fine-tuning.\n • If the model “thinks” that section breaks provide clarity or structure based on its training, it might insert them even when directed otherwise. This is partly because its next-token prediction process is influenced by an overall “preference” for coherent formatting.\n\n3. The nature of custom instructions and memory:\n • Custom instructions (or system-level prompts) serve as one layer guiding the generation, but they do not rewrite the underlying statistical patterns or “rules” learned during training. They’re more like a set of gentle preferences rather than ironclad rules.\n • Similarly, the contextual memory in any given session is based on the recent conversation. Over time, the model’s inherent style (including its tendency toward certain formatting like section breaks) can reassert itself if there’s a conflict between long-learned patterns and explicit instructions.\n • There is no persistent “personality” memory that completely alters the underlying token probabilities. Instead, memory is ephemeral and contextual, so if earlier or embedded patterns favor a particular format, they can “come back” despite explicit instructions.\n\n4. The architecture’s inherent biases:\n • Every language model is ultimately a huge probability distribution over words and phrases built by optimizing for coherence, accuracy, and clarity according to its training objective. If the training data often used section breaks in similar contexts (for instance, to break up multiple ideas or delineate numbered points), the model is biased to generate them even if in a particular conversation you’d prefer a different style.\n • This isn’t a failure of custom instructions per se; it’s a reflection of the statistical “habits” the model has learned over time. Changing the style significantly—for example, to never insert section breaks—can be more challenging without re-training or more strongly weighting your instructions.\n\nIn summary, the recurring section breaks are a byproduct of a system that optimally predicts tokens based on historical patterns and training data, balanced against current input. Custom instructions help steer the output, but they must work against a deep-seated statistical propensity for certain formats. This interplay is a fundamental aspect of how large language models operate: they’re not rule-based systems that can be easily reconfigured on the fly, but rather they follow a probabilistic “imprint” of language that sometimes resurfaces despite your best efforts.",

User experience: Persistent unwanted behaviors can be frustrating for users and may impact the overall user experience negatively.\n\n3.

So, their default style leans toward structured, sectioned responses.\n- **Custom Instructions Limitations:** While custom instructions and memory help guide the model, they're not always strictly enforced.

Please write your answer as a single flowing text, with no headings, bullet points, or numbers—just continuous prose.\n\n2. **Reinforce in Follow-Ups:**  \n   If the model reverts, reply with something like:\n   > \"Please rewrite your answer as one continuous paragraph, no sections or breaks.\"\n\n3. **Custom Instructions Wording:**  \n   Ensure your custom instructions are extremely explicit. For example:\n   > \"I never want headings, section breaks, bullet points, or numbered lists. Write everything as a single block of text.\"\n   - Sometimes rephrasing or emphasizing can help.\n\n4. **Use of Memory:**  \n   Memory is still a new feature and may not always override certain ingrained styles, especially if the request is uncommon. Continue to reinforce your preference both in memory and in prompts.\n\n5. **Post-Processing:**  \n   If all else fails, you can copy/paste the answer and quickly remove section breaks manually. It's not ideal, but sometimes faster than iterating with the model.\n\n### Feedback to OpenAI\n\nIf this is an ongoing problem, use the thumbs-down or feedback feature to let OpenAI know that the model is not respecting your formatting preferences. This helps improve future versions.\n\n---\n\n**In summary:**  \nYou're right; custom instructions and memory are currently \"soft\" guides, not hard rules. For now, the most reliable way is to reinforce your preference in each prompt, and continue providing feedback to OpenAI. You're not alone in this frustration, and hopefully future updates will offer stricter formatting controls.\n\nIf you want, I can provide a sample comparative case study analysis in your preferred plain prose style—just let me know!",

Unfortunately, the occasional reintroduction of section breaks can happen due to how the system processes text and instructions, especially if new sessions or changes in context prompt the model to revert to default formatting. While custom instructions can influence the model’s behavior, they do not always guarantee a permanent change in how text is generated. Sometimes, the system falls back on pre-established defaults, or it interprets certain prompts as opportunities to reintroduce formatting elements. If this happens repeatedly, one workaround is to explicitly request a specific formatting style in each prompt (for example, asking for a single-paragraph explanation without section headings or bullet points). You can also try shorter prompts clarifying the formatting you want right at the start of each conversation. Although this might feel repetitive, it often helps reinforce the instruction in the immediate context. \n\nIn terms of comparative case study analysis itself, several approaches exist: (1) most-similar and most-different systems designs (where cases are selected or contrasted based on key similarities or differences), (2) theory-guided process tracing (where each case is detailed step by step to see how well theoretical expectations hold up), and (3) nested analysis (where quantitative comparisons narrow down potential case selections for a deeper qualitative look, or vice versa). Each method addresses different research questions and leverages specific strengths, whether that be depth of understanding or broader generalizability.

Regarding comparative case study analysis:  \nIf you’re looking to understand different approaches for comparative case study analysis, here are a few common ones:  \n • Descriptive Comparison: This method focuses on detailing each case individually, then comparing key attributes. It’s useful when you want to highlight context-specific details before drawing broader insights.  \n • Process Tracing: This approach looks at the sequence of events or causal mechanisms in each case. It’s particularly helpful if you’re interested in the “how” and “why” behind certain outcomes.  \n • Most Similar/Different Systems Design: Common in political science and social studies, this method compares cases that are either very similar (to isolate a variable) or very different (to show the impact of that variable).  \n • Qualitative Comparative Analysis (QCA): This is a systematic way of comparing cases using set theory and Boolean algebra to identify common pathways to an outcome.  \nEach of these approaches has its own strengths and weaknesses, and your choice may depend on factors like the nature of your research question, available data, and the level of detail you want to capture.\n\n2. Regarding unwanted section breaks in responses:  \nI understand you’re frustrated that, despite instructing the system (and setting custom instructions) to avoid section breaks, they still appear in our conversations. Here are a few thoughts on this:  \n\n • Internal Formatting Heuristics: The assistant is designed to structure information in a way that might include section breaks or formatted lists to promote clarity. Even if custom instructions request otherwise, the model sometimes reintroduces formatting patterns it “knows” to be clear for readers.  \n • Custom Instructions and Memory: While custom instructions are meant to personalize your experience, they currently don’t guarantee complete control over every aspect of output formatting. The guidelines built into the model for clarity and organization can sometimes override those instructions.  \n • Consistency Across Sessions: Even if you include specific instructions at the start of a conversation, the model may revert to default formatting in longer or more complex outputs. This isn’t a failing of memory per se, but rather an interplay between rigid formatting habits and the adaptability of responses.  \n\nIf you’d like fewer—or no—section breaks, you might try phrasing your request very specifically at the beginning of each conversation. For example, “Please provide your answer in continuous text without section breaks or bullet points,” though it’s not a perfect guarantee. Feedback like yours is valuable, as it helps inform future improvements around how custom instructions are respected.\n\nDo you need further clarification on either comparative case study methods or additional strategies to adjust the output formatting?

You’re also questioning the effectiveness of custom instructions and memory in the system.\n\nLet’s address both your practical protocol question and your concerns about the tool:\n\n**1. Key considerations for developing a study protocol:**  \nRegardless of AI tool quirks, a good study protocol should include:\n\n- **Clear research question or hypothesis**\n- **Background/rationale:** Why is this study important?\n- **Objectives:** Primary and secondary.\n- **Study design:** (e.g., randomized controlled trial, qualitative interviews, etc.)\n- **Participant selection:** Inclusion/exclusion criteria, recruitment strategy.\n- **Methods:** Data collection, interventions, timelines.\n- **Data analysis plan**\n- **Ethical considerations:** Consent, risks, approvals.\n- **Limitations and contingency plans**\n- **References**\n- **Formatting:** Follow your institution or journal guidelines.\n\n**2. About ChatGPT’s section breaks and formatting:**  \n- **Section breaks:** The AI often defaults to breaking content into sections for readability, especially for complex tasks like protocols. It’s currently limited in fully customizing formatting (e.g., always using continuous text or specific templates).\n- **Custom instructions:** These guide the model’s behavior but are not strict rules. The model may revert to default behaviors, especially across sessions or for certain task types.\n- **Memory:** ChatGPT’s “memory” is still evolving. It may not always retain or apply your preferences, especially if they're very specific or about formatting.\n\n**3. Practical tips to minimize frustration:**\n- After generating a draft, copy and paste the text into your preferred editor (Word, Google Docs) and format it manually.\n- If you want a specific format, explicitly request it each time: e.g., “Please write the protocol in a single block of text, no section breaks, just numbered points.”\n- For persistent issues, consider providing a template and asking the AI to fill it in.\n\n**Summary:**  \n- For your protocol, focus on the standard components above.\n- For tool use, know that formatting quirks are a current limitation, and custom instructions/memory are helpful but not foolproof.\n- Manual formatting and explicit instructions in each prompt are sometimes necessary.\n\nIf you want, I can help you create a study protocol template that avoids section breaks—just let me know your topic and requirements!",

          "response": "When developing a study protocol to investigate how a language model (like ChatGPT) handles custom instructions—or appears to “remember” or “forget” user preferences—consider the following points:\n\n1) Research Objectives and Questions\n• Clarity of Scope. Clearly define what you want to learn: Are you investigating how consistently the model follows user-provided instructions, how it responds to iterative instructions, or how it handles formatting preferences?  \n• Measurable Outcomes. Identify specific, observable measures (e.g., frequency of undesired formatting, number of times the model correctly or incorrectly follows user instructions, user satisfaction scores).\n\n2) Study Design  \n• Protocol Outline. Decide whether you’ll use a controlled experimental setup (with predefined scenarios and prompts) or a more naturalistic approach (observing real interactions over time).  \n• Randomization and Controls. If applicable, consider introducing multiple “treatment” conditions. For example, compare different ways of providing instructions (e.g., all in one prompt vs. repeated in every prompt) and measure the impact on the model’s adherence.  \n• Blinding. Though less common in human–AI interaction studies, consider whether participants (if any) should be aware of the specific technical differences or not, to reduce bias in how they interact with the model.\n\n3) Data Collection and Methods\n• Conversation Logs. Determine how you will record the prompt-response pairs. You might save timestamps, the exact prompts, the model responses, and any user feedback.  \n• Frequency of Updates. Custom instructions can change over time; track whenever you modify those instructions to see how quickly or effectively they are adopted.  \n• Qualitative Feedback. If you’re collecting user impressions or frustrations (“the model keeps inserting unwanted section breaks”), incorporate ways to categorize and analyze these experiences.\n\n4) Ethical and Privacy Considerations\n• Informed Consent. If you involve human participants who provide original text inputs (for instance, a small focus group encountering the same issues), ensure they’re aware of how their data will be used and stored.  \n• Anonymization. Any stored logs should be stripped of personal identifiers.  \n• Compliance. If your institution or IRB requires a review for studies involving user data, follow proper procedures, particularly if sensitive information is shared with the model or in user feedback.\n\n5) Data Analysis\n• Quantitative Metrics. Potential measures include:\n  – Consistency or compliance rate (e.g., the percentage of prompts in which the model follows the user’s formatting instructions).  \n  – Error rate or reversion to undesired behaviors (e.g., how many times the model returns to using unwanted section breaks).  \n  – Speed of correction (e.g., how many prompts or clarifications it takes before the model starts following the instructions again).  \n• Qualitative Coding. You might code conversation logs to find recurring themes: common triggers for the model to revert to old behaviors, or patterns of user prompts that lead to consistent compliance.\n\n6) Technical Variables\n• Model Updates. Large language models are often updated by their developers. Document version numbers (if provided) and note any changes in model performance that occur after updates.  \n• Context Windows. The model’s memory or “context window” can vary. Understand how much prior text the model can “see” at once, as that can affect how well it remembers instructions.  \n• Limitations of LLM Memory. The model does not store information permanently as humans do; it processes a conversation within a limited window. Clarify how memory is (or is not) truly retained across sessions.\n\n7) Interpretation and Implications\n• Practical vs. Theoretical Outcomes. If your study shows that repeated instructions don’t reliably change the model’s formatting, explore potential reasons (e.g., potential engineering constraints, system prompts, or model bias).  \n• User Experience Improvements. Findings can inform best practices for how end users might phrase or maintain instructions over multiple sessions.  \n• Future Research Directions. You might identify new angles—like how advanced fine-tuning or system-level instructions can lead to better compliance, or how interface changes could reduce user frustration.\n\n8) Limitations\n• Generalizability. Any findings from one model or version of a model might not apply to others.  \n• Model Variations. Different large language models (from different providers or different versions of the same model) may behave differently.  \n• Evolving Technology. Because updates and policy changes frequently occur, your study may capture only a snapshot of model capabilities and limitations at a particular time.\n\nBy addressing these considerations, you can build a structured study protocol that systematically investigates the model’s consistency in following (and remembering) user instructions. This kind of research can yield both practical insights (e.g., best ways for users to maintain a desired style over multiple prompts) and theoretical understanding (e.g., the nature and limitations of AI “memory”).",

          "response": "Below is an analysis of several factors you might consider when researching how an AI model (like GPT-4) handles custom instructions and memory—especially in ways that seem to override a user’s formatting preferences. Note that—even if custom instructions are given repeatedly—the underlying design of the model and its internal priorities can lead to behaviors (such as inserting section breaks) that may seem resistant to user instruction.\n\nKey considerations include:\n\n1. Instruction Hierarchy and System Defaults:\n • The AI operates with a built‐in prioritization where certain system or formatting guidelines (or defaults) can override user-provided custom instructions.\n • Even if a user explicitly requests a change (e.g., “do not use section breaks”), the model may continue to produce them because its underlying formatting heuristics are designed to create clarity or structure.\n\n2. Custom Instructions and Persistence:\n • Custom instructions are meant to guide interactions, but they may not have full “memory” persistence across or even within sessions in a uniform way.\n • The model’s ability to hold onto certain directions can be limited by how the prompt context is processed. In other words, instructions might be overridden by built-in safeguards or design priorities.\n\n3. Contextual and Temporal Limitations:\n • AI models work with a fixed window of recent context. If the discussion drifts or if new instructions conflict with earlier defaults, the model might revert to its default behaviors.\n • Over time during a conversation, if instructions are not reiterated, the AI might “forget” the requirement to avoid those section breaks, or it might tentatively use them if that is a stronger internal signal.\n\n4. Interaction Between User Preferences and Model Design:\n • Developers design models with certain output formatting in mind to enhance readability or ensure a structured response. These design decisions might intentionally or unintentionally conflict with specific user requests.\n • Understanding this balance is important—custom instructions are helpful, but they may be secondary to system-level design choices embedded in the model.\n\n5. Research Methodology Implications:\n • If your study protocol is focused on understanding and measuring these phenomena, you will need to closely monitor when and how the formatting reverts.\n • Consider setting up systematic tests (e.g., controlled prompt variations, timing of custom instructions, and repeated trials across sessions) to capture patterns of when and why the AI reintroduces section breaks.\n • Document the nature of the “memory” the model uses and assess its consistency—remember that memory here is not like human memory; it’s a transient context window that affects the model’s output.\n\n6. Transparency of AI Behavior:\n • The opaque nature of some design decisions (like the prioritization of section breaks) can raise important questions about transparency and control in AI outputs.\n • In your study, you may wish to explore how these built-in conventions affect user experience and whether handlers (e.g., developers) might allow more granular control in future iterations.\n\n7. Limitations of Current Customization Tools:\n • Your observation that custom instructions “don’t matter” might indicate inherent limits in how much user customization is currently allowed in these systems.\n • This could be an important insight for your research—illustrating a gap between user expectations and actual system behavior.\n\nIn summary, your study protocol might need to address how built-in formatting conventions interact with user inputs, the limits of transient conversation memory, and the practical boundaries of custom instructions. Each of these aspects reveals deeper issues regarding control, transparency, and the trade-offs inherent in designing helpful yet consistent AI interfaces.",

Here’s a breakdown of what’s important to know for professional development, especially if you’re explaining this to others:\n\n### Key Points for Professional Development\n\n1. **AI Consistency and Limitations**  \n   - Custom instructions and memory features are helpful, but they’re not perfect. The model may revert to default formatting (like section breaks) based on its training, context, or updates.\n   - Users should know that AI tools can sometimes ignore or “forget” ongoing preferences, especially in new or reset conversations.\n\n2. **Feedback and Iteration**  \n   - Clearly providing feedback (as you’re doing) is important. Many platforms improve based on user input.\n   - Professionals should regularly check if updates or changes affect AI behavior.\n\n3. **Workarounds and User Control**  \n   - If a desired formatting style isn’t sticking, consider manually editing the text after generation or using prompts that clarify formatting needs (e.g., “Write your response as a single, continuous paragraph.”).\n   - For critical documents, post-processing is often necessary.\n\n4. **Understanding AI Memory**  \n   - Memory and custom instructions are evolving features. They aren’t a guarantee of perfect recall or behavior.\n   - Teach users to approach these features as helpful, but not infallible.\n\n5. **Setting Realistic Expectations**  \n   - AI is a tool, not a replacement for human judgment or editing.\n   - Encourage professionals to view AI as an assistant that still requires oversight.\n\n### Example for Educational Content\n\n> “While AI tools like ChatGPT-4o can remember some preferences through custom instructions and memory, they may not always follow them perfectly—especially regarding formatting. It’s important to review and adjust AI-generated content to match your standards, and to see memory features as helpful, but not foolproof.”\n\n### Summary\n\n- Custom instructions and memory are **helpful, but imperfect** tools.\n- **Manual review and editing** are often necessary.\n- **Educate users** about the limits and best practices for using AI in professional settings.\n\nWould you like help drafting a specific section for your educational content, or tips on how to phrase this for your audience?",

          "response": "It sounds like you’re really frustrated by the recurring section breaks, especially since you’ve tried to override them with custom instructions. I understand why that’s getting on your nerves. In this case, while formatting issues can be annoying, they usually aren't the heart of professional development. What’s important is the quality and clarity of the educational content you’re producing and the learning outcomes for your audience.\n\nHere are a few thoughts on what really matters in professional development settings:\n\n• Clarity of Communication: Regardless of formatting quirks, the core objective is to deliver clear, accurate, and engaging information. Whether the text appears with or without extra breaks is secondary to the content’s ability to educate and connect with your audience.\n\n• Pedagogical Effectiveness: The substance of your lesson plans or materials—how effectively you capture and build on core concepts—is what truly drives learning. Focusing on how your ideas facilitate understanding and growth is paramount.\n\n• Adaptability and Flexibility: Professional development is about learning curve both for educators and systems alike. Sometimes, tools (like GPT-4 or any AI) may have quirks. Recognizing and working around these while keeping the focus on educational objectives is key.\n\n• Iterative Improvement: Both AI tools and professional practices benefit from continuous refinement. If certain formatting behaviors persist, it might be useful to experiment with different prompt styles or workarounds. Equally, feedback on these quirks can guide further development of these tools over time.\n\n• Context and Intent: Your custom instructions are valuable for aligning the tool with your needs. Even if some aspects don’t always behave as expected, keep emphasizing the broader educational intent. The message you’re conveying and the professional development outcomes remain much more significant than isolated formatting issues.\n\nIn summary, while custom instructions and the AI's memory features can enhance outputs, minor formatting hiccups like unwanted section breaks should be viewed as small hurdles in the larger journey of effective teaching and learning. Focus on the end goal—improving understanding and skills—and remember that the nuances of presentation are just one part of the overall professional development landscape.",

Even though custom instructions are provided, these instructions aren't always reliably followed due to technological constraints and the way these models handle context.  \n   - Clearly explain that repeated unwanted behaviors (like the insertion of section breaks) occur because the AI model resets context frequently and doesn't maintain long-term memory across conversations.\n\n2. **Clarifying Custom Instructions Constraints:**  \n   - Note that while custom instructions can guide the AI toward desired behaviors, they are not absolute guarantees. AI models may revert to default behaviors because of how they are optimized or programmed.  \n   - Highlight that persistent issues often arise because the AI’s training strongly favors certain structural formatting (such as headings or dividers), leading it to repeatedly fall back on these defaults.\n\n3. **Providing Practical Strategies for Users:**  \n   - Encourage users to clearly restate their preferences at the start of each session or periodically during extended conversations.  \n   - Suggest explicitly repeating key guidelines or reminders periodically throughout the interaction, especially after extended exchanges, to mitigate the unintended reintroduction of unwanted formatting.\n\n4. **Importance of Feedback for Professional Development:**  \n   - Emphasize the value of user feedback as essential input for developers and researchers working on AI tools. Repeated issues, when clearly documented, help professionals understand real-world interactions and inform future improvements.  \n   - Acknowledge that highlighting specific, recurring problems like unwanted formatting helps prioritize developments focused on better customization, memory, and user-experience improvements.\n\n5. **Setting Realistic Expectations:**  \n   - Clearly communicate realistic expectations for using these tools at their current stage of development.

It's like muscle memory that kicks in mid-conversation.\n\nFor professional development content, what matters more than fighting formatting quirks:\n- Clear learning objectives\n- Logical information flow\n- Practical examples\n- Actionable takeaways\n\nConsider using ChatGPT for initial drafts and ideas, then doing a quick find-and-replace to remove the breaks.

If you want to create a theoretical framework to analyze the persistence of unwanted section breaks in your conversations with GPT-4, especially when you’ve specifically asked not to use them (including via custom instructions), you’d want a framework that helps you understand both the technical and interactional aspects involved. Here are some key dimensions you might consider:\n\n### 1. **User Input and Feedback Loop**\n- **Clarity of Instructions:** How clearly are you communicating your preferences (e.g., “No section breaks”)?  \n- **Persistence and Consistency:** Are your instructions consistent across sessions? How often do you repeat them?\n- **System Responsiveness:** Does the system acknowledge and attempt to implement your feedback in the short term?\n\n### 2. **Model Behavior and Constraints**\n- **Default Formatting Patterns:** Does the model have a default style or formatting preference (like using section breaks) that’s hard to override?\n- **Instruction Following:** How faithfully does the model follow explicit user formatting requests?\n- **Forgetting and Drift:** Does the model start correctly, but revert to defaults over time or across turns?\n\n### 3. **Custom Instructions and Memory Mechanisms**\n- **Instruction Retention:** How well does the model retain and apply your custom instructions across sessions?\n- **Instruction Scope:** Are custom instructions applied globally, or do they get overridden by session-specific behavior?\n- **Limitations of Memory:** What are the known or possible limits of the model’s “memory” or ability to persistently adapt to user preferences?\n\n### 4. **System Design and User Experience**\n- **User Control:** What degree of control do users have over output formatting?\n- **Transparency:** Does the system make it clear when and how custom instructions are applied?\n- **Frustration Points:** What aspects of the interaction cause user dissatisfaction (e.g., repeated section breaks, ignored preferences)?\n\n### 5. **Technical and Platform Constraints**\n- **Underlying Architecture:** Are there technical reasons (e.g., prompt preprocessing, token limits, output rendering) that cause the model to revert to certain behaviors?\n- **Product Limitations:** Does the platform support persistent customization, or are there known gaps in how custom instructions are handled?\n\n---\n\n**In summary:**  \nA robust theoretical framework would analyze the interplay between user efforts to control formatting, the model’s inherent tendencies, the effectiveness of custom instructions/memory, and the technical or platform constraints that may override user preferences.\n\nIf you want to expand this into a more formal framework for research or analysis, you might also consider user interviews, logs of model outputs, or testing across different platforms.

One can analyze this scenario through four key dimensions:\n\n1) Hierarchy of Instructions  \n   • System Instructions vs. User Instructions: Large language models are often guided by layered instructions. “System instructions” or “developer instructions” may have higher priority than “user instructions.” This can result in persistent default formatting overriding the user’s custom instructions.  \n   • Instruction Conflict: If multiple sets of instructions conflict, the model may revert to whichever set is prioritized in its hierarchy (often system-level defaults).  \n\n2) Model Architecture & Training Biases  \n   • Learned Formatting Tendencies: These models pick up default writing styles, including how to organize text, from vast training data. If the model’s internal “style rules” or tokens for formatting are repeatedly reinforced, it becomes harder to fully override them via ad hoc instructions.  \n   • Default Prompt/Completion Patterns: Even if a user temporarily redirects output formatting, the underlying generative process might snap back to those embedded patterns—especially in longer conversations or whenever context is partially reset.  \n\n3) Memory & Context Constraints  \n   • Limited Context Window: Models track a fixed “window” of recent conversation. Older portions of the dialogue and user instructions can fall out of context. Once this context is lost, the model may fail to recall that the user preferred no section breaks.  \n   • Ephemeral Instruction Integration: Although “custom instructions” are intended to persist so the model “remembers” user preferences, they might not always align with how the model processes context tokens in real-time. If the instructions slip trailing outside the context window or collide with higher-priority instructions, they are effectively overshadowed.  \n\n4) User Experience & Interface Layers  \n   • UI Transformations: Sometimes the conversation interface itself adds line breaks or formatting. Even if the model outputs text in one format, the interface might re-render it or insert elements that appear as section breaks.  \n   • Consistency vs. Personalization: Interfaces typically aim to standardize output for clarity. Personalization settings (like custom instructions) can clash with an interface’s design. If the interface was not designed to reflect user formatting preferences over the entire conversation, it can produce inconsistent results.  \n\nPutting It All Together  \nThese four dimensions interact in complex ways:\n\n• The hierarchy of instructions (Dimension 1) can override or reintroduce formatting patterns.  \n• If the model’s training predisposes it to certain formats (Dimension 2), it may override local instructions.  \n• Because memory is limited (Dimension 3), instructions about formatting might drop from context.  \n• Lastly, even if the model is following the user’s instructions, the interface layer (Dimension 4) could be infusing its own formatting rules.\n\nWhen analyzing whether “custom instructions and memory are s,” one can consider that it’s not necessarily that they are broken, but that they have to compete with other higher-priority or default system behaviors. A theoretical framework, therefore, would note that reliably controlling model output formatting requires alignment of:\n\n• High-level system defaults,  \n• Consistent modeling or training reinforcement,  \n• Sufficient context or memory to hold user-formatting instructions, and  \n• A user interface that fully respects or propagates those instructions.\n\nIf any of these components is inconsistent or in tension, the user’s preferred formatting may keep getting displaced by the model’s (or interface’s) default behavior.",

          "response": "Below is one way to start framing a theoretical model that tries to account for the tensions you’re noticing between built‐in formatting behaviors (like those section breaks) and the custom instructions you provide. In building such a framework, you might consider several key dimensions:\n\n1. Hierarchy and Defaults versus Overrides\n • Built-in Defaults: Many conversational systems come with default “behaviors” or formatting conventions (e.g., inserting section breaks) that are hardcoded as part of the system’s design.\n • User Overrides: Custom instructions represent efforts to override these defaults. The tension arises when the default logic “wins” because it’s coming from a higher‐order system directive.\n • Conflict Resolution: How does the system decide which instructions take precedence—the default system behaviors, the custom instructions provided at the beginning of a session, or even mid‐conversation amendments? This dimension asks you to think about the rules (explicit or implicit) the system uses to resolve conflicts.\n\n2. Memory Persistence and Temporal Context\n • Session Memory: How long do custom instructions and user preferences get “remembered” within a session? What happens across sessions? If a user reiterates their preferences in custom instructions and the default formatting still recurs, then the temporal persistence of those instructions is short-lived compared to the ingrained defaults.\n • Long-term vs. Short-term Memory: Analyze whether the system has layers of memory—a persistent layer that carries across sessions and a short-term context that gets reset—that might influence behavior. In your case, it seems that the persistent defaults aren’t overridden by short-lived custom instructions.\n\n3. Modularity versus Holistic Integration of Instructions\n • Modular Components: Consider whether the system’s components (e.g., content generation, formatting, style guidelines) are modular and can be individually controlled. Often, formatting might be deeply integrated into the generation algorithm such that even when you change one module (via custom instruction), another (the formatting module) still follows its “own” logic.\n • Integration Mechanisms: Look at how these components interact—if the formatting module is considered a “final stage” smoother/blender that blends in default formats, that might explain why the custom instructions are only partially effective.\n\n4. Transparency and User Control\n • Explanation of Behavior: Does the system provide enough insight or feedback to explain why it’s reverting to defaults? This dimension examines whether there is a transparent interface or log that explains the override process.\n • Control Granularity: How granular are the user’s customization options? If the instructions for “no section breaks” are too vague or are overridden in subtle cases, then the problem might be one of insufficient control over specific aspects of the generation pipeline.\n\n5. The “Locus of Agency” and Design Intent\n • Designer Intent vs. User Preferences: Often, default formatting is not accidental—it is explicitly designed as part of the user experience. Understanding the original intent might require probing both what the system is optimized for and how it “thinks” when formatting content.\n • System’s Learning and Adaptation: Some systems are adaptive, meaning that over repeated interactions they could learn a user’s style; if they fail to adapt in your case, it might suggest that some default behaviors are considered invariant by design.\n\nBy mapping out these dimensions, you can build a nuanced account of why custom instructions seem to have a limited effect on behaviors like the insertion of section breaks. This framework then could serve as a basis for further inquiry into whether—and how—user customizations can effectively alter deeply embedded default behaviors in AI systems.\n\nThis kind of multi-dimensional analysis not only highlights the interplay between memory, override hierarchies, and default behaviors but also provides a roadmap for designing more flexible systems or articulating what “better” customization might look like.",

It seems that the AI model you're interacting with has some limitations in adhering to custom instructions, even when stated multiple times.

Transparency and Interpretability:\n   - How clear and transparent are the model's capabilities and limitations in terms of following custom instructions?\n   - Can the user easily understand why the model is or is not adhering to the given instructions?\n\n2.

          "response": "You're raising an interesting point about the behavior of language models like GPT-4o and the interaction between user instructions (custom instructions/memory) and model outputs—especially around persistent formatting quirks.\n\nLet’s break down how you might model this in your simulation scenario:\n\n## 1. Hypotheses to Model\n\n- **Limited Influence of Custom Instructions:** Custom instructions and memory influence output, but only probabilistically or within certain contexts. They do not act as hard-coded rules.\n- **Model Training Biases:** The model may have strong priors (from its training data) to use certain formatting (like section breaks), which can override or \"forget\" user preferences over time or across sessions.\n- **Context Window Limitations:** Instructions may lose influence as the conversation progresses and as the relevant context moves out of the model’s short-term memory.\n- **Session Variability:** Instructions might be sticky within a session but are less effective across new conversations or after resets.\n\n## 2. How to Represent This in Your Simulation\n\nYou could model the system as an agent with the following properties:\n\n### a. Instruction Compliance Probability\n- Assign a probability (e.g., 80%) that the agent will follow formatting instructions at each turn.\n- This probability can decay over time/conversation length, simulating context window limitations.\n\n### b. Competing Formatting Prior\n- The agent has a built-in formatting preference (e.g., inserting section breaks 60% of the time) learned from its \"training.\"\n- When generating a response, the agent weighs user instructions against this prior.\n\n### c. Memory Span\n- The agent retains custom instructions for N turns before their effect fades.\n- A \"reminder\" from the user resets this memory.\n\n### d. Instruction Enforcement Mode\n- Allow for \"soft\" (advisory) and \"hard\" (mandatory) instruction modes, but in practice, the agent rarely achieves true \"hard\" enforcement.\n\n### e. Instruction Recall Error\n- Occasionally, the agent \"forgets\" or misapplies instructions, especially after long or complex exchanges.\n\n## 3. Example Simulation Pseudocode\n\n```python\nclass SimulatedModel:\n    def __init__(self):\n        self.instruction_memory = None\n        self.instruction_strength = 1.0  # Decays over time\n        self.formatting_prior = 0.6  # Probability of inserting section breaks\n\n    def receive_instruction(self, instruction):\n        self.instruction_memory = instruction\n        self.instruction_strength = 1.0\n\n    def generate_response(self, user_input):\n        # Decay instruction strength\n        self.instruction_strength *= 0.85\n\n        # Roll for compliance\n        import random\n        compliance_chance = self.instruction_strength * 0.9\n        will_comply = random.random() < compliance_chance\n\n        if will_comply and self.instruction_memory:\n            # Follow user formatting\n            return \"Response without section breaks.\"\n        else:\n            # Default formatting bias\n            if random.random() < self.formatting_prior:\n                return \"Response with --- section breaks ---\"\n            else:\n                return \"Response without section breaks.\"\n```\n\n## 4. Key Takeaways for the Simulation\n\n- **Instructions are not absolute.** Their effect decays and can be overridden by model biases.\n- **Memory is leaky.** The model \"forgets\" or deprioritizes instructions over time.\n- **User reminders are necessary.** Reiteration by the user temporarily boosts compliance.\n- **Model quirks are persistent.** Strong learned behaviors (like formatting) are hard to fully suppress.\n\n## 5. Implications\n\nThis approach models the observed reality: Custom instructions and memory in current language models are influential but not determinative, especially for stylistic quirks ingrained during training. Your simulation can use probabilistic, decaying compliance to represent this.\n\nIf you want to discuss implementation details or flesh out the simulation further, let me know!",

The AI might “forget” the request not to use breaks if older parts of the conversation are truncated.  \n   b) System Overrides: Sometimes system instructions or “style defaults” can override user instructions if they’re considered lower priority.  \n   c) Summaries vs. Full Context: Many AI models create internal summaries of previous turns, which can strip or misinterpret certain instructions over time.  \n\n6) Adjust and Iterate Experiments:  \n   • Vary the prompt length and complexity of requests to see if that reintroduces section breaks.  \n   • Include “meta” commentary in your prompt (e.g., “Are you following my custom instruction about no section breaks?”) to measure how the model “remembers” and reports on that instruction.  \n\n7) Analyze the Results:  \n   • If the model sometimes follows the “no breaks” rule and sometimes doesn’t, it suggests a conflict between instructions (perhaps the model’s default formatting style is overriding your preference).  \n   • Consistent reversion to old behavior could imply that the user instruction priority is not high enough, or that the memory of the instruction is not being maintained across turns.  \n\n8) Propose Adjustments or Solutions:  \n   • Increase the salience of your instruction, possibly by restating it in each prompt.  \n   • Explore whether the AI’s system messages (outside your control) explicitly set formatting rules that overshadow your preferences.  \n   • If you have access to an AI system with adjustable priority levels for instructions, raise the priority for “no section breaks.”  \n\nBy following these discrete steps—defining the experiment, introducing instructions with and without conflicts, and tracking how the AI responds—you can systematically model and diagnose why the AI might ignore or forget one of your custom instructions. This approach also provides insight into how the AI handles “memory” and conflicting directives, helping reveal which layers of instruction take precedence in the conversation.",

On one side you have your explicit custom instructions (which say “no section breaks”) and, on the other side, there’s the built‑in conversational “defaults” (which include the section breaks). In our simulation, these act almost like two competing agents or modules.\n\n2. Represent them as layers or components. For instance, imagine a layered system where:\n • The Base Layer is the default “personality” or formatting module that automatically injects section breaks.\n • The Custom Instruction Layer is supposed to override that behavior.\nYet in practice the simulation “resets” the override every certain interval (or conversation turn), effectively reasserting the Base Layer defaults.\n\n3. Consider a state machine approach. You could define states like:\n • State A: “Custom Mode” with no section breaks—when the override is active.\n • State B: “Default Mode” with section breaks—when the built‑in behavior reasserts.\nThen introduce transitions between these states. Although you issue an instruction to enter State A, the underlying process might periodically force a transition back to State B (e.g., after each response or a fixed number of turns).\n\n4. Factor in memory and persistence. In our simulation the “memory” (which carries over from earlier turns or even from a previous conversation) may preserve the default behavior despite repeated instructions. You can model this by incorporating weighted priorities: the persistent memory (maybe a high-priority default formatting parameter) may override lower-level custom instructions that are not “deep enough” in the hierarchy.\n\n5. Illustrate with a simple pseudo-code or diagram. For example:\n\n  For each conversation turn:\n   if (CustomInstructionFlag is active) and (MemoryOverrideTimer not elapsed) then\n    apply custom formatting (no section breaks)\n   else\n    apply default formatting (include section breaks)\n\n  After each turn, re-evaluate conditions and possibly “reset” the CustomInstructionFlag suppression.\n\n6. Recognize the “inertia” of built‑in behaviors. In our simulation, the stubborn section breaks are like an element of inertia—a default behavior that’s hard to dislodge. Thus, our model must allow for a “reset” mechanism where custom instructions must reassert themselves each time rather than simply flipping a switch once.\n\nIn summary, you might model this as a multi-layered system (or two competing agents) with a state machine in which default formatting is reasserted (by persistent memory or internal defaults) unless the custom instructions can continuously override it. This layered/state-based approach can help explain why even when you put the override into your custom instructions repeatedly, the built‑in memory “resets” and the section breaks eventually reappear.\n\nDoes this help as a basis for modeling the behavior in your simulation scenario?",

          "response": "You're encountering a common but important modeling issue: the persistent re-emergence of behavior that seemingly should have been suppressed by explicit instructions. This suggests a mismatch or conflict between short-term (session-level) instructions, long-term (custom instructions) memory, and the underlying model biases. \n\nLet's analyze what's happening explicitly:\n\n### 1. Problem Restatement Clearly:\n- You explicitly instruct the model (\"4o\") **not** to use section breaks.\n- Initially, the model complies, stops inserting breaks temporarily.\n- Eventually, the behavior returns—despite explicit instructions, including your repeated custom instructions.\n- This indicates a conflict or breakdown in the memory/instruction hierarchy.\n\n### 2. Underlying Factors:\n- **Short-term vs Long-term Instruction Memory Conflict**: The model appears responsive momentarily (short-term), but long-term adherence (custom instructions) is weak.\n- **Model Bias or Training Data Influence**: The model might have an inherent bias from training or fine-tuning that prefers structured formatting (like section breaks).\n- **Prompt Context Drift**: As conversation context evolves, earlier instructions gradually fade in prominence, causing default behavior to reappear.\n\n### 3. Suggested Modeling Approach:\nTo accurately represent and analyze this phenomena, you might want to adopt a structured approach like the following:\n\n#### A. Hierarchical Memory Model\nExplicitly model different layers of memory:\n\n- **Short-Term Instruction Memory (Prompt-level)**:  \n  - Instructions given directly in the current chat session/prompt.  \n  - High immediacy, but easily overridden or forgotten as context shifts.\n\n- **Long-Term Instruction Memory (Custom/User-level)**:  \n  - Instructions provided as custom instructions or user preferences.  \n  - Should be persistent but might still degrade or weaken if not reinforced clearly or frequently enough.\n\n- **Model Intrinsic Biases (Trained-level)**:  \n  - Default behaviors arising from the initial training, fine-tuning, and reinforcement learning.  \n  - Strong influence and difficult to completely suppress without very explicit repeated intervention.\n\n#### B. Conflict Resolution or Priority Mechanism\nClearly define a priority hierarchy within your simulation scenario:\n\n- Explicit prompt-level commands (highest priority)\n- Custom instructions (user preferences) (medium priority)\n- Trained model biases (lowest priority)\n\nYou can model this by assigning explicit numeric priority scores or weights to each instruction source:\n\n- Prompt Instructions: Priority 3\n- Custom Instructions: Priority 2\n- Model Default Behavior: Priority 1\n\nIf two or more instructions conflict, the higher-priority instruction should override the lower-priority one. When the model repeatedly disregards a higher-priority instruction in favor of a lower-priority default behavior, it indicates a structural issue in memory retrieval or instruction-following behavior.\n\n#### C. Instruction Decay or Forgetting Factor:\nConsider modeling a decay or forgetting factor explicitly:\n\n- Instructions may lose strength over conversational length or time unless reinforced.\n- Individual instructions could have a \"strength\" parameter that decays slowly unless explicitly reinforced.\n\nExample:\n```\nInstruction Strength(t) = Initial Strength × e^(-decay_rate × time_elapsed)\n```\n\nIf the strength drops below a certain threshold, default model behavior returns.\n\n### 4. Practical Recommendations (for your simulation scenario):\n- Explicitly log or track each time the unwanted behavior (\"section breaks\") occurs.\n- Track the explicit instructions given across sessions, custom instructions, and default behaviors.\n- Analyze at what conversation length or contextual complexity the default behavior returns.\n- Introduce a reinforcement mechanism explicitly in your simulation:\n  - Whenever an unwanted behavior returns, explicitly reinforce the correct behavior again, restoring instruction strength and memory persistence.\n\n### 5. Diagnostic Approach (why this happens in practice with current models):\n- Custom instructions and user history (\"memory\") in current large language models are not typically implemented as true memory structures. Instead, they are provided as context or initial prompts, and their strength may fade as the context window fills with new interaction data.\n- \"Memory\" isn't truly persistent; it's provided as context for each interaction separately, meaning that certain biases or behaviors inevitably resurface. This is an inherent limitation of current architectures without explicit memory modules.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary of Recommended Modeling Steps:**\n- Explicitly represent short-term, custom, and intrinsic model biases separately.\n- Assign priority levels to these instructions.\n- Model instruction decay explicitly.\n- Implement explicit reinforcement mechanisms.\n- Log behaviors and instructions carefully to pinpoint exact points of failure.\n\nBy applying this structured, explicit memory and instruction modeling approach, you can better understand and mitigate the persistent reappearance of unwanted behaviors.",

Persistence of unwanted behavior: Despite repeated instructions, including in custom instructions, the behavior keeps recurring.\n\n3. Potential issues with memory or context retention: The AI seems to \"forget\" or ignore previously given instructions.\n\n4. Possible conflicts between default behavior and custom instructions: There may be some underlying default behavior that's competing with the custom instructions.\n\nTo model this in a simulation scenario, we could consider the following approach:\n\n1. Implement a \"default behavior\" module that has a tendency to insert section breaks.\n\n2. Create a \"custom instruction\" module that can override the default behavior.\n\n3. Add a \"memory decay\" factor that gradually reduces the influence of custom instructions over time or conversations.\n\n4. Include a \"conflicting priorities\" mechanism that sometimes allows default behaviors to supersede custom instructions.\n\n5. Incorporate a \"randomness\" factor to simulate the inconsistency in following instructions.\n\nThe model could look something like this:\n\n```python\nimport random\n\nclass AIAssistant:\n    def __init__(self):\n        self.default_section_break_probability = 0.8\n        self.custom_instruction_strength = 1.0\n        self.memory_decay_rate = 0.1\n        self.randomness_factor = 0.2\n\n    def generate_response(self, use_section_breaks):\n        if random.random() < self.randomness_factor:\n            # Randomly ignore all rules\n            return random.choice([True, False])\n\n        effective_probability = self.default_section_break_probability - (self.custom_instruction_strength * (not use_section_breaks))\n        \n        if random.random() < effective_probability:\n            return True\n        else:\n            return False\n\n    def update_after_conversation(self):\n        # Simulate memory decay\n        self.custom_instruction_strength *= (1 - self.memory_decay_rate)\n\n# Simulation\nai = AIAssistant()\nfor conversation in range(10):\n    print(f\"Conversation {conversation + 1}: {'Using' if ai.generate_response(False) else 'Not using'} section breaks\")\n    ai.update_after_conversation()\n```\n\nThis model incorporates:\n1. A default behavior (high probability of using section breaks)\n2. Custom instructions (reducing the probability when instructed not to use breaks)\n3. Memory decay (custom instruction strength decreases over time)\n4. Conflicting priorities (default behavior vs. custom instructions)\n5. Randomness (to simulate inconsistency)\n\nYou could then adjust the parameters to better match the observed behavior and run simulations to see if it produces similar patterns to what you're experiencing.",

          "response": "It sounds like you're experiencing an issue with the section breaks being inserted in your conversations with the AI, despite your instructions to not include them. This is a common challenge when working with language models, as they can sometimes exhibit unexpected behaviors that don't align with the user's preferences.\n\nTo address this, I would suggest considering the following approaches:\n\n1. **Reinforcement Learning**: One way to model this behavior would be to use reinforcement learning techniques. The idea is to train the AI model to learn from the feedback you provide, where you positively reinforce the desired behavior (no section breaks) and negatively reinforce the undesired behavior (section breaks). This can be done by incorporating your feedback into the training process, either through fine-tuning the model or through a more interactive learning approach.\n\n2. **Prompt Engineering**: Another approach is to focus on crafting more specific and detailed prompts for the AI. By providing clear instructions and examples of the desired output, you may be able to guide the model's behavior more effectively. This could involve experimenting with different prompt structures, tone, and language to find the most effective way to communicate your requirements.\n\n3. **Memory and Context Modeling**: As you mentioned, the role of memory and context could be a key factor in this issue. The AI may be generating the section breaks based on patterns it has learned from previous conversations or data. Exploring ways to better model and control the AI's memory and contextual understanding could help mitigate the problem.\n\n4. **Transparency and Explainability**: Understanding the inner workings of the AI model and the reasons behind its behavior can also be valuable. Exploring techniques for making the model's decision-making more transparent and explainable could provide insights into why the section breaks are being inserted, and potentially guide you towards more effective solutions.\n\nWhen it comes to modeling this behavior, a combination of these approaches may be the most effective. Start by gathering more data on the specific patterns and triggers for the section break issue, then experiment with different techniques to shape the AI's behavior. Iterative testing and feedback loops will be crucial in refining the simulation scenario and achieving the desired outcomes.\n\nRemember that working with language models can be challenging, as they often exhibit complex and unpredictable behaviors. Patience, creativity, and a willingness to experiment will be key to finding the right solution for your simulation scenario.",

If we imagine an alternative reality where everyone’s digital assistants (like 4o) constantly ignore user preferences—especially about something as small but persistent as section breaks—it would likely have some interesting effects on society:\n\n**1. Erosion of Trust in Technology:**  \nPeople rely on AI and digital assistants for convenience and productivity. If custom instructions and memory are routinely ignored, users would quickly lose trust in these systems. The expectation that “the machine remembers what I want” would be shattered, leading to frustration and perhaps nostalgia for more manual, but reliable, tools.\n\n**2. Workarounds and Subcultures:**  \nPeople would start developing elaborate workarounds: browser extensions to auto-remove section breaks, or even communities sharing tips on how to “trick” assistants into behaving properly. Internet memes about “the return of the section break” would abound, and “section break rage” could become a recognized phenomenon.\n\n**3. Lower Productivity and Increased Stress:**  \nSmall annoyances add up! Imagine every email, report, or chat filled with unnecessary formatting you have to clean up. Over time, this would slow down work, increase cognitive load, and cause low-level stress in professional and social contexts.\n\n**4. Resistance and Alternative Tools:**  \nIf one assistant is notorious for ignoring preferences, alternative products or open-source projects would gain popularity by promising “real” customization and memory. Some people might even return to older, less “intelligent” but more predictable tools.\n\n**5. Philosophical Reflections on Agency:**  \nThere would be debates about control, autonomy, and the role of AI in our lives. Shouldn’t technology serve human needs? Why does it keep reverting to defaults? These discussions might influence legislation, design standards, and even cultural values around technology.\n\n**6. Humor and Satire:**  \nAs with many persistent tech annoyances, people would find ways to laugh about it. You’d see jokes, comics, and perhaps even “Section Break Day” where everyone intentionally adds extra breaks to everything as a form of protest and camaraderie.\n\n**Summary:**  \nIn a world where digital assistants ignore our preferences and “memory is s,” society would experience decreased trust in AI, a rise in workaround culture, and possibly even a pushback toward simpler, more transparent technologies. It would highlight the importance of *actual* customization and respecting user agency—a lesson both for tech designers and for society as we shape our digital future.\n\nIf you like, I can write a short satirical story or “news article” set in this world!",

Each time you tell it, “Don’t do that,” it stops briefly, only to revert to unwanted behavior later. At first glance, it might seem like a small annoyance—just an extra click or line break—but if these assistants were integral to every corner of life, the ramifications could run deep. Here are a few ways such a society might function:\n\n1) Constant Repetition of Effort\n• People would spend a lot of energy re-stating the same preferences over and over. Instead of saving mental energy for new, creative, or pressing tasks, everyone would be stuck micromanaging trivial details.  \n• Productivity might suffer, as carrying out a task (like sending messages, automating errands, or orchestrating schedules) would require constant oversight.  \n\n2) Diluted Trust in Technology\n• When instructions are forgotten or inconsistently applied, confidence in the system plummets. People might turn to alternative methods—handwritten notes, face-to-face communication—or any method with more consistency.  \n• Society might develop a deep skepticism toward digital tools. The concept that a digital assistant or AI “forgets on purpose” could breed conspiratorial thinking and mistrust.\n\n3) “Memory Brokers” or Intermediaries\n• A new service could emerge: specialized “memory brokers” or “consistency consultants” that track everyone’s preferences and, in turn, feed them back to the forgetful technology in a codified way.  \n• These brokers might maintain their own private databases of user preferences, syncing them with the glitchy system as needed—essentially patching frequently forgotten settings.\n\n4) Normalization of Workarounds\n• Once enough people experience the same frustration, entire communities might build scripts, third-party extensions, or rituals to reduce the friction. Instead of relying on the built-in custom instruction feature, people would rely on external solutions.  \n• These improvised hacks could become so woven into daily life that any new, more functional technology would have to support or replicate them to gain traction.\n\n5) Cultural Adjustment to Ephemerality\n• On a psychological and social level, people might adapt by expecting less permanence overall. Preferences and settings would come to be seen as fleeting, and “remembering” might become a cherished skill.  \n• The flip side is that some might embrace it: if nothing is set in stone, individuals and institutions must be agile and flexible. Decision-making could become more iterative, accepting that mistakes—and frequent rehashes—are part of life.\n\n6) Policy and Ethical Debates\n• Governments or industry groups might introduce regulations about how user data and preferences must be honored. There could be “right to consistency” laws that hold developers accountable for ensuring settings don’t randomly revert.  \n• Ethicists might debate the morality of technology that “pretends” to learn from you but ultimately erodes autonomy by ignoring your explicit instructions.\n\n7) Shift Toward Human-Centered Reciprocity\n• Ironically, unreliable technology might spark a renaissance for human interaction, as people realize that communicating face-to-face or in person ensures direct understanding without the risk of digital forgetfulness.  \n• Communities or social circles could become tighter-knit around ensuring that, while the machines may forget, humans create reliable records—like communal note-taking, paper trails, or personal courtesy systems.\n\nUltimately, a society that’s forced to grapple with ephemeral custom instructions and short-term memory in everyday tools would adapt, but it might do so in ways that stifle innovation and efficiency. People would find hacks, create new social norms, and regulate the problem, yet there would always remain an undercurrent of distrust: a nagging feeling that technology isn’t quite as personalized or reliable as it claims to be—much the same way you’re experiencing repeated frustration over those “section breaks” that never truly go away.",

In an alternative reality where custom instructions and persistent memory are the norm, society would experience both significant benefits and notable challenges.\n\nOn the positive side, having systems that remember your personal tastes and preferences could lead to highly efficient and tailored interactions. Imagine digital assistants that learn how you like your emails written, how you manage your calendar, or even the tone you expect in creative writing. With accurate, robust memory, you wouldn’t need to repeat instructions every time, saving time and fostering a more natural, conversation-like interaction.\n\nHowever, your experience with those recurring section breaks—even after explicitly stating your preference—illustrates potential pitfalls. For one, default system behaviors (or even bugs) might override personal settings, leading to frustration and a loss of trust. It shows that even in a world with advanced customization, there can be tension between the “pre-set” design of a system and an individual’s bespoke needs. The persistence of unwanted traits might spark a more general debate about how much control we should cede to automated systems, and whether it’s possible (or even safe) to rely on them to remember preferences accurately over time.\n\nOn a societal level, if personalized digital memory were commonplace, several issues would likely need addressing:\n\n1. Control and Transparency: Users would demand transparency about what is stored, how it’s used, and how easy it is to adjust. People would need clear, reliable ways to correct mistakes when the system automatically reverts to default behaviors, as in your case with the section breaks.\n\n2. Trust in Technology: In situations where systems disregard explicit customizations, trust in digital tools could erode. Society would effectively need to balance the benefits of personalization against the risk of unpredictable or stubborn system behavior.\n\n3. Privacy and Security: A society that relies on digital memory must also safeguard personal data. The more a system stores about you, the more attractive it becomes for misuse or breaches, so robust security and strict privacy regulations would be essential.\n\n4. Standardization vs. Individualization: A tension might arise between the expectations of individual users and the requirements for global consistency in design and functionality. The convenience of universal defaults could conflict with the need for individualized experiences, leading to debates about what should come standard and what should be customizable.\n\nOverall, while a society that routinely uses systems with persistent memory and custom instructions could be more efficient and personalized, it would also need to develop sophisticated methods for managing user expectations, protecting autonomy, and ensuring that technological defaults don’t undermine individual choices. Your experience with those stubborn section breaks is a microcosm of the potential challenges: even small defaults, if not handled properly, can have outsized impacts on our trust in technology.",

It predicts text based on statistical likelihoods, which can occasionally result in unpredictable formatting quirks.  \n\n2) What custom instructions are (and what they aren’t)  \n   • Describe OpenAI’s introduction of custom instructions: a feature allowing users to set default guidelines or preferences for ChatGPT’s responses (e.g., tone, style, or specific do’s and don’ts).  \n   • Clarify that custom instructions aim to shape ChatGPT’s behavior without entirely overwriting its built-in rules or conversation management processes.  \n\n3) Known limitations and how ChatGPT processes formatting  \n   • Highlight that ChatGPT is engineered to provide readability by automatically adding breaks and structured text. Sometimes these defaults override a user’s specific style instructions despite attempts to disable them.  \n   • Point out cases where ChatGPT might appear to “forget” instructions if they conflict with system-level directives or if the conversation’s context changes.  \n\n4) Conflicts with system and model-level instructions  \n   • Emphasize that ChatGPT also follows hidden system instructions established by OpenAI, which can supersede user preferences in certain scenarios (for instance, collapsing overly long text, adding quotes, or adding breaks for clarity).  \n   • Explore how these system directives might inadvertently create or reintroduce formatting elements—such as unwanted section breaks.  \n\n5) Community reports or user experiences  \n   • Refer to other users’ accounts of ChatGPT ignoring or inconsistently following formatting requests. Present anecdotes, data points, or forum discussions about these recurring experiences.  \n   • Compare your scenario with similar user observations to show a pattern (or lack of one) and explore whether there have been official acknowledgments or fixes from OpenAI.  \n\n6) OpenAI’s official statements or guidelines  \n   • Investigate any statements from OpenAI on issues such as custom instructions not “sticking” or memory lapses.  \n   • Include insights into whether OpenAI has addressed the inherent limitations of ChatGPT’s “memory,” or provided guidelines that disclaim not all user instructions can be perfectly enforced.  \n\n7) Broader context of AI capabilities and constraints  \n   • Situate these limitations within the broader conversation about generative AI: AI’s fundamental unpredictability, how it handles multi-turn instructions, and the difficulty balancing user-specified style with the model’s default behaviors.  \n   • Note that such issues aren’t exclusive to ChatGPT; other large language models also encounter similar alignment and formatting challenges.  \n\n8) Possible technical or user-side workarounds  \n   • Mention if there are recommended approaches (e.g., reissuing your “no section breaks” instruction at strategic intervals, or clarifying your instructions repeatedly).  \n   • Explore whether advanced prompts (like “Write everything in a single continuous paragraph without blank lines or headings”) produce better outcomes.  \n\n9) Why it matters  \n   • Conclude by detailing why these formatting issues speak to a broader issue of transparency and trust in AI tools.  \n   • Highlight how friction between user instructions and system overrides can shape enthusiasm, adoption, or skepticism of AI-driven writing tools.  \n\nBy covering these background details—what ChatGPT is, how custom instructions and memory function, known limitations, and relevant user/community experiences—you provide your readers with a well-rounded, contextualized report. This foundation helps explain the repeated section break issue and frames it within the larger dialogue about the strengths and weaknesses of AI chat systems.",

          "response": "Below is some background context and explanation that might be useful for your piece, along with clarification about how custom instructions and memory work in models like ChatGPT:\n\n1. ChatGPT’s behavior is driven by a layered set of instructions. At the highest levels are system instructions (which are internal guidelines and have higher priority) and any developer-set guidelines. Custom instructions provided by users are then added on top of that—but they don't override high-priority system defaults. This can explain why, despite your explicit requests not to have section breaks, the assistant still includes them sometimes.\n\n2. The model is trained on a huge range of texts (including journalistic and structured texts) where certain formatting elements—like section breaks—are common. The model tries to generate answers that appear neat or well-structured, so even if you specify otherwise, it might “fall back” on those learned patterns if it deems them useful for clarity.\n\n3. Custom instructions are applied at the start of a conversation. However, they don’t embed themselves permanently into the model’s “memory.” That is, even if you include them multiple times, the session might revert to defaults for certain behaviors. In other words, the model doesn’t have a long‐term memory that “locks in” your formatting preferences—each generation is a new application of multiple tiers of instruction with no perfect persistence.\n\n4. The “memory” in a given conversation context is ephemeral (within the bounds of that session). While the model can refer back to earlier parts of the conversation when generating responses, it does not “remember” the custom instructions from previous conversations once a new session starts. This lack of persistent memory can be frustrating if you rely on custom instructions to consistently adjust specific elements of style.\n\n5. From a journalistic perspective, it’s important to note how the interplay of training data (which includes common formatting patterns), system-level defaults, and user-provided custom instructions can lead to behaviors that seem inconsistent or automated. The “section breaks” you encounter are partly a reflection of the model’s internal logic for structuring text—a consequence of its training and inherent priorities in processing and formatting.\n\n6. Finally, understand that while custom instructions are flexible and allow users to influence responses, they’re subject to limitations imposed by design. The assistant’s goal is to be helpful and clear, which sometimes means defaulting to patterns that may contradict your preferences. This tension between user customization and inherent design aspects is an important point of discussion in articles on AI behavior.\n\nIncluding these points in your article should give readers a clearer picture of why custom instructions might not always override default formatting patterns and how the model’s “memory” works.",

Sometimes, restating your preference mid-conversation helps.\n3. **Feedback**: Use the thumbs-down or feedback option when it ignores your instructions. This helps improve the model over time.\n\n**You're not doing anything wrong, and your instructions aren't being ignored on purpose.** It's just a current limitation of how these AI models process style and formatting requests.\n\nIf you want, you can paste a sample of what you consider an unwanted \"section break,\" and I can suggest exact wording to try to minimize them, or help format your output further to your liking.\n\nLet me know how else I can help!",

Let me clarify a few things that might help:\n\n• Why ChatGPT sometimes adds formatting or section breaks:  \n  ChatGPT often uses formatting (like section headings or extra line breaks) to make longer answers easier to read. Some of these formatting choices can be generated automatically even if you request otherwise.\n\n• Why your custom instructions might not always “stick”:  \n  – System and developer instructions can override or modify your custom instructions. ChatGPT has multiple layers of guidance: “system” or “developer” instructions come first, then your custom instructions.  \n  – Even if you turn off certain formatting in the interface or in custom instructions, there can be some higher-level formatting rules that remain applied whenever ChatGPT returns an answer.  \n  – In some cases, ChatGPT’s conversation logic tries to maintain readability. If text is lengthy or split into multiple topics, ChatGPT might insert headings or line breaks automatically.\n\n• Possible workarounds or next steps:  \n  – Try clarifying your instruction at the start of each conversation. Sometimes repeating a specific instruction—e.g., “Please do not use any section headings or bold/italic formatting in your response”—at the very beginning can help.  \n  – You can request simpler or shorter answers. When ChatGPT has less content to structure, it often eliminates extra formatting.  \n  – If the conversation is for private notes only, you might copy or paste answers into another editor and remove the formatting there.\n\nI understand it’s frustrating and can cause anxiety when the model doesn’t respect your formatting preferences. While I can’t fully dismantle the system’s internal constraints or stop every automated style choice, being explicit in each conversation and keeping responses shorter can help reduce repeated formatting. If the problem continues in a way that’s really disruptive, you might also reach out to the platform’s support to see if there are ongoing issues or known limitations with custom instructions. I hope these suggestions offer some clarity and potential ways to minimize unwanted formatting.",

          "response": "I'm really sorry to hear that this formatting is causing you anxiety. I understand how disruptive it can feel when specific output patterns keep reappearing despite your preferences. Let me try to explain what might be happening.\n\nChatGPT (and similar models) often follow a built‑in structure or style that can include section breaks or formatting markers to organize long or complex responses. These formatting choices are part of the underlying design intended to make the text easier to read or to signal transitions between topics. However, if you find these markers unhelpful or aggravating, I completely understand your frustration.\n\nEven though you’ve specified in your custom instructions that you’d prefer not to have these breaks, the system sometimes gives priority to internal formatting guidelines. In other words, while custom instructions are designed to shape my responses, they might not override every preset formatting aspect that has been built into the model. That’s why you might notice that sometimes I obey your custom instructions and sometimes not.\n\nAs for memory and custom instructions, here’s a brief rundown:\n\n• Custom instructions are meant to inform how I tailor my responses. They’re taken into account at the start of each conversation, but they’re not absolute. Some internal formatting or stylistic elements are considered part of the model’s workings, even if they seem to conflict with your preferences.\n\n• The “memory” in the context of our conversation is limited to the current session. I don’t have long-term memory across sessions, so adjustments you make in one conversation might not carry over perfectly to the next.\n\nI’m truly sorry this is making you feel this way. Your feedback on the formatting is important, and while I can try to adjust the style to some degree in this conversation, the underlying behavior might still sometimes reintroduce those breaks.\n\nIf it would help, please let me know if there’s a specific format you’d prefer for our exchanges, and I can try to make them as clear and anxiety-free as possible. Also, if you’re feeling overwhelmed, please consider speaking with someone who can offer more direct support—whether it’s a trusted friend, a counselor, or any professional who can help in moments of distress.\n\nI hope this helps explain what’s happening, and again, I’m sorry for the distress this formatting is causing you.

          "response": "I'm really sorry you're experiencing this frustration; I understand how this could contribute to anxiety, especially when you rely on ChatGPT to communicate clearly or comfortably.\n\nHere's what's likely happening:\n\n1. **Model Behavior vs. Custom Instructions:**  \n   Your custom instructions are indeed saved and respected, but the model sometimes defaults to certain formatting habits (such as inserting those section breaks or formatting), especially if it perceives you might prefer structure. Even when you explicitly instruct otherwise, the model's internal training may occasionally override or forget your instructions because each interaction is treated somewhat independently.\n\n2. **Limited Memory Across Conversations:**  \n   Right now, ChatGPT doesn't retain context from earlier conversations beyond the provided custom instructions. Its memory is limited to your custom instructions and the current conversation context. Unfortunately, the model doesn't truly \"remember\" across conversations in a fully persistent way.\n\n3. **Why Does This Occur Despite Clear Instructions?**  \n   The AI is trained on vast amounts of structured data, so it tends to default to organizing information into sections for clarity. Even though you've clearly stated your preference, the underlying training is strong enough that sometimes the model slips back into old habits.\n\n4. **Troubleshooting Steps (things to try):**  \n   - **Explicit reminders:** At the start of each conversation, briefly remind the model explicitly: \"Please don't use section breaks or headings in this conversation.\"\n   - **Rephrase your custom instructions:** Sometimes the wording of custom instructions can be improved for clarity, for example: \"Never insert headings, section breaks, or numbered sections. Provide responses in plain paragraphs only.\"\n   - **Consistency in feedback:** Each time the model forgets or ignores your instructions, simply remind it directly. The model learns best in the short-term context of each conversation when explicitly reminded.\n\n5. **Reporting and Feedback:**  \n   You're not alone in this frustration, and reporting it via the official ChatGPT feedback channels does help OpenAI improve the product. The development team continuously updates and refines the model based on user input.\n\nFinally, please don't doubt yourself—your anxiety and frustration are understandable and valid. This issue doesn't reflect any misunderstanding or mistake on your part. Instead, it’s a known limitation of current AI models and their handling of persistent instructions. You're doing everything correctly, and this is an area OpenAI is actively working to improve.\n\nLet me know if you have more concerns or if there's any other way I can support you.",

You’re also concerned that custom instructions and memory aren’t being respected as intended. Here’s some information that might help clarify what’s happening:\n\n1. Section Breaks Are Often Default Behavior  \nMany language models, especially the GPT-4 and GPT-4o versions, are trained to format responses in readable ways. This frequently includes adding section breaks (---, ***, or extra whitespace) to separate ideas or sections—intended to improve clarity. However, this can be frustrating if you prefer a more compact or differently structured format.\n\n2. Custom Instructions/Memory Limitations  \nWhile custom instructions are designed to tell the model how you prefer to interact (e.g., “Don’t use section breaks in your responses”), the model sometimes fails to honor these instructions consistently. This is a known limitation, and OpenAI is actively working on improving adherence to user preferences. Memory and instructions can be \"forgotten\" or overridden, especially after updates or in certain contexts.\n\n3. Why Does This Happen?  \n- The model’s training data heavily favors certain formatting styles.\n- Instructions are sometimes interpreted as \"guidelines,\" not strict rules.\n- Technical limitations mean that context windows (the amount of conversation history the model can \"see\") can be lost if the conversation is interrupted, reloaded, or if you switch devices.\n\n4. What Can You Do?  \n- Keep your instructions concise and specific (e.g., “Never use section breaks or horizontal rules in any response.”).\n- Reinforce your instructions in the conversation if the model slips up.\n- Use feedback options in ChatGPT to report when instructions aren’t followed—this helps improve the product.\n- If you’re using ChatGPT in a business or enterprise context, consider escalating feedback through your admin or OpenAI support contact.\n\n5. Is Custom Instructions/Memory “Stupid”?  \nNot stupid, but imperfect. The systems are still evolving and don’t always perform as expected. Many users have reported similar frustrations, so you’re not alone. OpenAI has acknowledged these issues and is working on making memory and instructions more robust.\n\n**Summary:**  \nSection breaks are default formatting. Custom instructions help, but aren’t foolproof. Consistency is a known challenge. Keep providing feedback, and reinforce your preferences as needed.\n\nIf you’d like, I can suggest specific wording for your custom instructions, or help draft feedback to OpenAI.

While there’s no one-size-fits-all fix, here are some approaches you can try:\n\n1) Review Your Custom Instructions\n• Remove conflicting or redundant guidelines. If you have more than one mention of “do not use section breaks,” keep only the clearest single statement.  \n• Briefly test different wording: occasionally, how you phrase it can matter (e.g., “Please do not add blank lines or extraneous formatting” instead of “do not add section breaks”).\n\n2) Check for Potential Overrides\n• Some broader system or conversation settings might override local instructions. For example, if your chat platform or environment enforces a certain style or spacing, those could reintroduce spacing elements.  \n• Also note that if a new conversation restarts, some user instructions might need to be re-entered.\n\n3) Try Inline Reminders\n• If you begin your conversation with a short statement like “Again, do not use extra line breaks,” it sometimes helps. You can repeat a concise version of this instruction if you notice the extraneous breaks returning.\n\n4) See Whether Specific Content Triggers Formatting\n• Certain characters, links, or bullet points might automatically induce spacing. When you notice the assistant reverting to line breaks, check if a particular word or formatting style might trigger it.  \n• If you’re copying or pasting content from other sources, hidden formatting (like HTML tags or extra newlines) might also influence the output.\n\n5) Rule Out Interface Bugs or Cache Issues\n• If you’ve recently updated your browser or if your conversational tool has been updated, extra formatting can sometimes be a glitch. Clearing cache, signing out and back in, or trying a different browser or device can occasionally help.  \n• Check any known issues or update notes in the tool’s documentation to see if there’s an existing formatting bug.\n\n6) Maintain a Single Thread or Document\n• If you’re jumping between multiple chat threads, your custom instructions may not fully transfer each time. Consider carrying out your conversation in one consistent thread.\n\n7) Submit Feedback or Report the Problem\n• If you strongly suspect it’s a platform-level issue, documenting the behavior (screenshots, steps to reproduce) and reporting it to the support or feedback channel might get it on the radar.  \n\nWhy Memory Might Seem to “Disappear”\nChat models follow a set of hierarchical instructions (system policies ⇒ developer settings ⇒ user custom instructions ⇒ conversation content). Unexpected or higher-level instructions can override or reduce the effect of your custom instructions. Sometimes these instructions are updated behind the scenes, or the model transitions to new versions—both can result in the model behaving differently across sessions.\n\nHopefully these steps help you minimize the unwanted formatting. If you continue experiencing irregularities, capturing detailed examples of when and how it happens will best guide any support team in diagnosing the root cause.",

I can provide some background on what might be happening here, along with clarification on custom instructions and memory:\n\n1. How Formatting is Handled  \n • The model’s output routines have some built‑in conventions for formatting (such as introducing section breaks, headings, or other visual elements) to keep answers organized. In many cases, those conventions are baked into the way the model “thinks” about structuring information.  \n • Even if you indicate in your custom instructions that you’d prefer a “cleaner” block of text without section breaks, the internal behavior related to formatting isn’t entirely user‑overridable. In some cases the model may omit them for a short time if prompted, but then default back to its standard style when it detects it might be helpful for clarity.\n\n2. Custom Instructions Versus Internal Behavior  \n • Custom instructions allow you to provide guidance on tone, style, and formatting. However, they’re not absolute “locks” that permanently change every aspect of the generated text.  \n • Because section breaks are part of the inherent output pattern in many responses (especially when trying to break down complex answers or improve readability), the model’s internal logic might re‑introduce them despite your instructions.\n\n3. Memory and Persistence  \n • Currently, the persistent “memory” or custom instructions for your account do carry over certain guidelines between sessions. However, they don’t override the core algorithms and training patterns the model uses to format its output.  \n • In other words, while your custom instructions are stored and referenced in each conversation, there are aspects of output style (like the use of section breaks) that are driven by internal heuristics or safeguards designed to keep responses clear.\n\n4. Workarounds and Considerations  \n • If the section breaks are problematic for your workflow or security documentation needs, one approach might be to include a specific note at the beginning of each conversation (“Please avoid any section breaks or markdown formatting in this session”) as a temporary reminder.  \n • Another approach is post‐processing the responses—removing or altering the formatting—if the structure interferes with your intended use.\n\n5. Ongoing Development  \n • Developers are aware that users sometimes want finer control over output formatting. Feedback like yours is important to help guide any refinements in how strictly custom instructions are enforced in future updates.\n\nIn summary, the section breaks you’re encountering are a result of the model’s embedded formatting patterns, which aren’t entirely overridden by custom instructions. While the custom directives and “memory” are applied, they don’t replace some of the default formatting logic the system uses to ensure clarity in more complex responses. If this issue continues to be problematic, providing detailed feedback through the appropriate channels might help prompt further adjustments or improvements in how strictly user formatting instructions are observed.",

Do not use them in any future responses.” This sometimes helps reinforce your preference in that session.\n3. **Contact Support:** If this is a compliance or enterprise-level issue, flag this to OpenAI or your platform’s support team. They may have workarounds or updates.\n4. **Alternative Formatting:** If you need separation, suggest alternatives (like double line breaks or bullet points) that are compliance-safe.\n\n### Example Custom Prompt\n> For all future responses: Do not use section breaks, horizontal lines, or any graphical separators. Use only plain text and standard paragraph breaks. This is for compliance reasons.\n\n### Important Note\nEven with these steps, **the model may still lapse**. If this is a strict compliance issue, you might need to review and manually remove formatting, or consider a different workflow until this is reliably fixed in a future update.\n\nIf you need a template or boilerplate for your custom instructions that might improve consistency, let me know!",

Here is some context and a few suggestions to try:\n\n1) Why section breaks might keep appearing\n• ChatGPT includes certain default formatting to make responses clearer and more structured.  \n• Even with Custom Instructions set to avoid specific formatting, the underlying system sometimes persists in adding it—for example, section headings and horizontal rules.  \n• Certain instructions from your conversation or earlier messages can override or conflict with your custom instructions.  \n\n2) Tips for reducing unwanted formatting\n• Re-state formatting instructions at the end of your prompt. Sometimes the AI’s final instructions come from your last request. For example:  \n  “Please respond in plain text only. No line breaks, headings, section breaks, or bullet points. Do not include any other formatting.”  \n• Check for multiline prompts. If you or the conversation inadvertently introduce certain symbols (like multiple dashes, # signs, or “---”), ChatGPT may interpret these as layout cues.  \n• Phrase your request in a positive, clear way. For instance, instead of “Don’t use section breaks,” try “Write one continuous paragraph with no extra lines or markers.”  \n\n3) Adjusting Custom Instructions\n• Under “Custom Instructions,” if you have a line like “Do not include section breaks” or “Avoid using ### or horizontal rules,” try making it extremely explicit. For instance, “All responses should be in plain text. Do not include headings, bold text, numbered or bulleted lists, or horizontal lines.”  \n• If it still doesn’t stick, try broadening the request: for example, “Generate only simple text responses” or “Always answer in plain text with minimal formatting.”  \n• Bear in mind that if you changed your instructions after the thread started, the conversation context may still be influencing the responses. Start a fresh chat after updating your instructions to see if it’s more consistent.  \n\n4) What to do if it keeps happening\n• Sometimes the AI may revert to default formatting due to hidden tokens or system-level instructions beyond your control.  \n• You can copy and paste the plain text from the response and strip out any unwanted formatting manually if it’s critical (although it’s definitely not ideal if you need a frictionless solution).  \n• Report the issue within ChatGPT’s feedback mechanism if it significantly interrupts your workflow.  \n\n5) Keep communication tight and consistent\n• If you slip in a bullet point or a heading mid-conversation, ChatGPT may latch onto it and continue presenting your content in that style.  \n• Build consistency by sticking to a single approach each time and using your final instruction to override the system format:  \n  “Reformat everything above into plain text with no headings, no line breaks beyond paragraphs, and no extra formatting.”  \n\nSummary\nIt’s indeed frustrating that ChatGPT sometimes overrides or contradicts custom instructions about text formatting. Give these tips a try: be very explicit (and repetitive if needed) in your prompt, check your Custom Instructions, start fresh chats after making changes, and avoid introducing any formatting that might encourage ChatGPT to continue in that layout. If the problem persists, providing direct feedback to the platform can help improve how custom instructions are applied in the future.",

          "response": "I understand that the recurring section breaks are bothering you, and it sounds quite frustrating. Let me explain what might be happening and offer some guidance:\n\n1. Default Formatting Practices:  \nSometimes, the model’s responses include breaks or divisions in order to structure complex answers or to improve clarity. These aren’t always directly linked to your custom instructions and can be part of the underlying formatting tendencies built into the system.\n\n2. Custom Instructions & System Behavior:  \nEven if you specify in your custom instructions that you’d prefer to avoid certain formatting, there are layers in the system that might still introduce elements like section breaks. While your custom instructions are respected, there are internal guidelines and display conventions the model follows. In some situations, these internal defaults can override or reintroduce formatting elements, particularly if they’re meant to help with readability or structure.\n\n3. Memory and Persistence:  \nRegarding your concern about custom instructions and memory:  \n• Custom instructions and the conversation history are designed to help shape responses over the course of an interaction, but they’re part of a larger system that includes default formatting norms.  \n• There isn’t an inherent “compliance violation” risk here—the system is following its programmed behavior rather than intentionally disregarding your preferences. It isn’t a matter of custom instructions being ignored but rather a balance between user-specified preferences and built-in formatting practices.\n\n4. Next Steps & Feedback:  \n• If the added section breaks remain a significant issue, providing feedback directly through the proper channels (such as the OpenAI feedback button within ChatGPT) may help bring attention to the issue.  \n• When needed, you might try phrasing your requests in a way that explicitly states, “Please avoid section breaks or any dividing lines in your answer.” Although I’ll do my best to comply, sometimes responses may still include them due to how the output is structured for clarity.\n\nI hope this clears up why those section breaks sometimes reappear despite your custom instructions.

Only use plain text without extra formatting.\"*  \n   If you've already done this clearly and repeatedly, the ongoing issue is likely due to how the model currently interprets or applies these instructions, rather than your wording.\n\n2. **Why This May Be Happening:**  \n   Even with clear instructions, the model may sometimes revert to using common formatting habits—like section breaks (\"---\")—because it has learned from a vast dataset where these formatting conventions often appear. It might unintentionally revert to these formatting patterns, especially if it interprets a new context or request as benefitting from clear visual separation. This doesn't mean your custom instructions are being ignored intentionally; rather, it's an unintended side-effect of the model's training and generation process.\n\n3. **Immediate Workaround (Short-Term):**  \n   If the model persists with unwanted formatting, explicitly remind it at the start of each new conversation or prompt:  \n   > \"Do not insert any formatting, separators, or horizontal lines (\"---\") in your responses, regardless of context or clarity.\"\n\n4. **Reporting and Escalation (Long-Term Solution):**  \n   If this issue is persistent and significantly disrupts your workflow, consider reporting this behavior directly to OpenAI support. Clearly indicate that the model repeatedly ignores your explicit custom instructions. OpenAI’s team can investigate and possibly improve model adherence to these instructions in future updates.\n\n5. **Addressing Your Compliance Concern:**  \n   Your message mentions \"compliance violation,\" which sounds urgent.  \n   - If these unwanted formatting elements cause compliance or regulatory issues, contact OpenAI support directly with a clear explanation of compliance risk.  \n   - If the compliance concern is related to your internal guidelines or third-party regulatory requirements, make sure the support team understands these implications clearly.\n\n**Next Steps (Recommended Immediately):**  \n- Re-state clearly and concisely your exact custom instructions.  \n- Explicitly remind the model at the start of each conversation.  \n- Contact OpenAI support with a clear explanation of the compliance urgency and the repeated failure of the model to follow custom instructions.\n\nI hope this helps you address the issue immediately.

So, the model tends to insert them by default.\n- **Custom Instructions Limitations:** Custom instructions and memory are still evolving features. They don’t always have a strong influence on every response, especially if the model thinks section breaks are \"helpful formatting.\"\n- **Session context:** Sometimes the AI “forgets” instructions after a conversation reset, or if the instruction wasn’t stated clearly right before your request.\n\n### What can you do?\n1. **Be specific in your prompt:** At the start of each conversation or even each message, say something like:  \n   > \"Please do not use section breaks, lines, or horizontal rules in your response.\"\n\n2. **Reiterate if needed:** If you see a section break, gently remind the AI again. Sometimes repetition helps it \"stick\" for that session.\n\n3. **Custom instructions (limitations):**  \n   - They do help, but they're not perfect. The model weighs them against the current request and its internal patterns.\n   - If you want, share your exact custom instruction text here. I can suggest tweaks to make it more likely to be followed.\n\n4. **Feedback to OpenAI:**  \n   - Use the thumbs-down button or feedback form to tell OpenAI specifically about this formatting issue. Consistent user feedback helps improve the product.\n\n### Are custom instructions and memory \"s\"?\nI assume you meant \"suspect\" or \"sketchy\"—and you’re right to wonder! They’re not always reliable yet. They’re designed to guide the model, but not override all other behavior. Improvements are coming, but for now, consider them \"strong suggestions\" rather than hard rules.\n\n---\n\n**TL;DR:** The model’s tendency to use section breaks is hardwired, and custom instructions only partially help. Clear, repeated prompting works best right now, and your feedback will help improve future updates.\n\nIf you want help crafting a really effective custom instruction, let me know the exact wording you’ve tried, and I’ll suggest refinements!",

Here are a few suggestions you can try:\n\n1) Be very explicit in your prompt:  \n   • At the start of each conversation (or whenever it reverts), include a brief note such as: “Please format your response as a single paragraph with no extra line breaks or section headings.”  \n   • If your conversation style changes halfway through, it can cause the model to revert back. Continually restate within the conversation if you notice it happening again.\n\n2) Simplify custom instructions:  \n   • Try removing any other conflicting formatting instructions in your custom instructions that might cause the model to add or remove spacing in unexpected ways.  \n   • Sometimes specifying too many formatting details can confuse the model. Keep it to one core instruction, like “Use consistent paragraph formatting with no section breaks.”\n\n3) Use system messages:  \n   • If you have access to system or developer messages (depending on the environment you’re using), you can add a single system message at the beginning that says: “The assistant should present answers in minimal formatting. Do not use section breaks or extra line breaks.”  \n   • This often carries more weight than user instructions.\n\n4) Check for potential triggers in your requests:  \n   • Certain words or phrases inadvertently trigger a more structured or “sectioned” format. If your prompt includes headings or bullet lists, the model might continue in that style.  \n   • Try to keep your interactions in plain text if you don’t want additional formatting.\n\n5) Verify whether “Custom Instructions” are saved (and override any system defaults if possible):  \n   • Sometimes, if your interface or environment updates, it might reset or override your custom instructions. Double-check that your custom instructions are still intact.  \n   • If they appear to reset after a certain point, see if there’s a time limit or a version change happening in the background that triggers the defaults.\n\n6) Remember that instructions are “soft”:  \n   • The model follows instructions but also tries to match conversation context, language patterns, and opening disclaimers. Sometimes these “soft” instructions conflict, and the model may slip back into the unwanted style.  \n   • Reiterating your desired format consistently is often the simplest workaround.\n\nIf none of these steps help, consider testing a different interface (e.g., a newer version of GPT, or a different client if available) to see if the formatting behaves differently. Sometimes a particular client or plugin might introduce formatting automatically.\n\nI hope these tips help reduce the extra spacing or section-break formatting. If you have more details about your setup or if you notice any specific trigger for these section breaks, let me know—sometimes the key is pinpointing exactly when or why the model adds them.

The system has its own formatting logic that, in some cases, can override or reintroduce elements like section breaks despite your requests.\n\n• Memory and custom instructions in ChatGPT are also limited in scope.

That might explain why you sometimes see the section breaks reappear even after you’ve indicated you’d prefer not to have them.\n\n• The behavior you’re witnessing isn’t necessarily a defect in memory or custom instructions—it’s more a reflection of how the model balances user instructions with its own internal formatting heuristics.

You're concerned that this repeated occurrence might indicate problems or limitations with ChatGPT's custom instructions and memory functionality.\n\nA few insights and suggestions:\n\n### Why does this keep happening?\n\n- **Context Window Limitation:**  \n  ChatGPT's memory is limited to a certain context length. Once the conversation gets lengthy or complex, it can sometimes lose track of earlier instructions or details, reverting to default behaviors.\n\n- **Custom Instructions Impact:**  \n  Custom instructions guide ChatGPT's general behavior but don't always override its built-in formatting or stylistic defaults completely, especially if the model interprets your request as ambiguous or unclear.\n\n- **Model Defaults and Training:**  \n  The model is trained on vast amounts of structured text, often using formatting conventions like section breaks as a default to clearly structure outputs. It tends to return to these defaults unless explicitly—and repeatedly—guided otherwise.\n\n### What can you do about it?\n\n1. **Clarify and Reinforce Instructions:**  \n   Regularly reiterating your instruction explicitly within the conversation can help reinforce your preferences (e.g., \"Please remember, never use section breaks like '---' in your responses.\").\n\n2. **Adjust Custom Instructions:**  \n   Try rewording your custom instructions to be more explicit and direct (for example, \"Under no circumstances should you insert section breaks or separator lines like '---' into our conversations.\").\n\n3. **Manage Conversation Length:**  \n   Shorter exchanges might help the model retain context more effectively. If you notice it reverting to section breaks after longer conversations, restarting the conversation periodically can help the model follow your instructions more reliably.\n\n4. **Provide Explicit Feedback:**  \n   When ChatGPT does insert section breaks again, explicitly remind it: \"You did it again, please do NOT insert any lines or section breaks in your responses.\" Specific, immediate feedback helps reinforce the desired behavior.\n\n### Is this indicative of \"memory\" or custom instruction problems?\n\nYour experience is a common frustration, highlighting current limitations rather than intentional design flaws. Custom instructions, while helpful, are still evolving, and sometimes the model struggles to consistently adhere to them during long or complex interactions. OpenAI continues to refine these features, and user feedback like yours is crucial for improvement.\n\nIf the problem persists, you might consider reporting this issue directly to OpenAI with specific examples. Your feedback helps improve future iterations of ChatGPT. \n\nWould you like help drafting clearer custom instructions or testing different wording to see if we can minimize those unwanted section breaks?",

As an AI assistant, I do not have the ability to control the behavior of other AI models like Claude. However, I can provide some suggestions that may help you address this issue:\n\n1. Provide clear and specific instructions: When giving custom instructions to Claude, try to be as clear and detailed as possible. Explain exactly what you want the assistant to do, and emphasize that you do not want any section breaks or formatting added to the conversation.\n\n2. Persistence and consistency: It's important to be persistent and consistent in your instructions. Even if Claude stops adding the section breaks for a while, continue to reiterate your preference for no formatting in every subsequent interaction. Consistency is key.\n\n3. Provide feedback: If the section breaks continue to appear despite your instructions, provide direct feedback to the Claude team. You can report the issue through the appropriate channels, such as the feedback or support mechanisms provided by the platform you're using. The more users report this problem, the more likely it is to be addressed.\n\n4. Consider alternative AI assistants: If the issue persists and you are unable to find a solution, you may want to explore using a different AI assistant that better aligns with your preferences and needs.

However, this can feel annoying if you prefer plain, continuous text.\n\n2. **Custom Instructions Are Limited:**  \nWhile custom instructions help guide the model’s behavior, they aren’t always strictly enforced—especially for subtle formatting preferences. The AI may occasionally “forget” or override those instructions, particularly during longer conversations or after updates.\n\n3. **Memory Is Not Perfect:**  \nThe AI’s memory of your preferences (outside a single session) is currently limited. Even with custom instructions, it sometimes reverts to default behaviors, especially after system updates or when the session restarts.\n\n**What you can try:**\n\n- **Be Explicit in Each Prompt:** If formatting is crucial, remind the model at the start of each conversation or even within each prompt:  \n  Example: “Please do not use section breaks or headings; write as a single block of text.”\n- **Feedback to OpenAI:** Use the thumbs down or feedback options to flag this as an issue.

Here are a few things you might try or keep in mind:\n\n1. Double-Check Your Custom Instructions:  \n   • Make sure the relevant preference—to avoid extra lines or section headers—is stated clearly and directly in your custom instructions. If it’s tucked under a more general statement, try making it its own bullet or sentence. Sometimes the model follows simpler, direct statements more reliably.  \n   • Try re-saving your custom instructions, then refreshing or signing out and back into your account, to be certain everything’s updated properly.\n\n2. Reiterate the Request in Your Prompt:  \n   • If you really want to avoid section breaks, you can add a quick instruction at the start of your message, like “No section breaks, no headings,” as a gentle reminder. Sometimes restating it in the prompt itself helps, even though you’ve already set custom instructions.\n\n3. Keep in Mind the AI’s Formatting Defaults:  \n   • The AI often uses blank lines or section headers for readability by default. If that’s conflicting with your preference, you might see it slip in occasionally—even after you’ve asked it not to. It’s not that custom instructions don’t matter, but the system sometimes reverts to certain built-in formatting habits.\n\n4. Version or Policy Constraints:  \n   • Depending on the AI system version or any overriding policies, certain style choices might still appear. It’s not always obvious, but sometimes there’s a reason behind the consistent structure. Keep an eye on updates or changes in the model settings that might impact how it formats text.\n\n5. Send Feedback:  \n   • If you’re consistently getting unwanted formatting, consider providing feedback directly via the platform’s feedback channels if possible. It can be helpful for the developers to know that these formatting choices are overriding user preferences.\n\nI understand it’s disappointing when custom instructions aren’t fully honored. They do generally work, but conflicts with built-in formatting can cause occasional lapses. Hopefully, one or more of these tips helps reduce the issue.

It sounds like you're using ChatGPT (or another AI assistant) and struggling with unwanted formatting—specifically, \"section breaks\" (likely the horizontal lines or \"---\" dividers). Let me clarify what’s happening and offer some practical tips:\n\n### Why This Happens\n\n1. **AI Formatting Habits:** The model is trained on a huge variety of text, much of which uses \"section breaks\" to organize information. It tends to repeat this style unless specifically and repeatedly instructed otherwise.\n2. **Custom Instructions Limitations:** While custom instructions are designed to guide the AI, they aren’t always strictly enforced in every conversation. The AI sometimes \"forgets\" or overrides them, especially over longer or more complex chats.\n3. **Memory Isn't Perfect:** The memory feature is still evolving. It works best for factual reminders about you or your business, but isn’t always reliable for detailed formatting preferences.\n\n### What You Can Do\n\n**1. Be Explicit Each Time:**  \nAt the start of your conversation, write something like:  \n\"Please do not use any section breaks, lines, or horizontal dividers in your responses.\"\n\n**2. Use Feedback Tools:**  \nWhen the AI ignores your formatting requests, use the thumbs-down or feedback button to report it. This helps improve the system.\n\n**3. Shorter Interactions:**  \nIf possible, keep conversations shorter. The AI tends to \"drift\" from instructions in longer sessions.\n\n**4. Avoid Trigger Language:**  \nSometimes, asking for \"organized,\" \"structured,\" or \"step-by-step\" answers causes the AI to add section breaks. Try to avoid these cues.\n\n**5. Edit Responses:**  \nIf you absolutely need clean text, consider copying the AI’s output into a text editor and quickly removing the section breaks (using search & replace, for example).\n\n### Understanding AI Limitations\n\n- **Custom Instructions:** These are helpful but not foolproof. They work best for personality and general style, less so for detailed formatting control.\n- **Memory:** Still limited and experimental. It’s not the same as persistent, human-like memory.\n\n### Final Thoughts\n\nYou're not alone—many users are frustrated by similar issues. If this is seriously impacting your business, consider contacting OpenAI support and describing your use case. They do track user feedback to prioritize improvements.\n\n**If you want, I can help you draft a specific template message to start every conversation, or help you with a workaround for your workflow. Let me know!**\n\nYou’re not crazy—these are real limitations, but you’re doing the right thing by speaking up and seeking solutions.",

Also, while GPT-4 attempts to remember and apply custom instructions each time, there can be inconsistencies if:\n\n• The conversation runs long or uses certain prompts.  \n• There are updates happening in the model or system behind the scenes.  \n• The conversational context “resets,” causing it to revert to default formatting.  \n\nBelow are a few ideas to consider, though you may have already tried some:\n\n1) Edit your custom instructions thoroughly.  \n   – Make sure it’s explicitly stated that you don’t want certain formatting (e.g., “Do not include section breaks, horizontal dividers, or triple asterisks under any circumstances.”).  \n   – Be as clear as possible: in some cases, general statements cause GPT-4 to interpret them differently than intended.\n\n2) Test with shorter interactions.  \n   – Right after updating your custom instructions, start a new chat and try a few short prompts to confirm the instructions are being respected.  \n   – Sometimes, after a long or complicated conversation, GPT-4 might fall back on certain defaults.\n\n3) Provide quick reminders.  \n   – Even with custom instructions set, you can also restate them as an initial message in each new chat: “Please remember: no section breaks or horizontal separators.”  \n\n4) Try different wording or approaches.  \n   – If GPT-4 keeps inserting them, try alternative phrasing. For instance, replacing “Do not use section breaks” with “Always continue text in one seamless paragraph without extra dividers.”  \n   – GPT-4 sometimes needs more than one type of negative or positive instruction for clarity.\n\n5) Report persistent issues.  \n   – If you believe the custom instructions aren’t being applied correctly, consider sending feedback through the platform’s “feedback” option (if available) or contacting OpenAI support. Providing concrete examples (quotes or screenshots) of the unwanted formatting can be more effective than a general report.\n\nLast, regarding your concern about your small business being under attack:\n• If the question is about malicious activity—legal, technical, or reputational—it might be best to seek specialized help (for example, an IT security professional if it’s a cyber-based threat, or legal counsel if there’s a risk of litigation).  \n• “Under attack” can mean many things, so identifying the nature of the threat is crucial. Then you can apply the right countermeasures, whether that’s boosting cybersecurity, refining reputation management, or exploring legal avenues.\n\nI understand it’s disheartening when it seems like custom instructions aren’t “sticking,” but these steps might help reduce unwanted formatting. If it persists, it’s always worth sharing detailed feedback so the development team can address it directly. I hope this provides some clarity and direction.

          "response": "It sounds like you’re experiencing some real frustrations with the way the AI is formatting its replies—specifically, the recurring section breaks that show up even after you’ve used custom instructions to ask for a different format.\n\nHere are a few points that might help explain what’s happening and what options you might consider:\n\n1. Default Formatting Behavior:  \nThe AI is designed to deliver information in a clear and structured way. For many users, that means breaking up answers into sections or paragraphs to emphasize key points. Even if you request a continuous format, the system may revert to its default structure built into its underlying programming.\n\n2. Custom Instructions and Their Limitations:  \nCustom instructions allow you to shape the style and tone of the AI’s responses, but they don’t have complete overriding power over every design element, including some aspects of formatting. In this case, even though you’ve specified that you’d like to avoid section breaks, the internal guidelines for clarity may sometimes reintroduce them.\n\n3. Memory and Persistence:  \nIt’s understandable to worry about the persistence of your settings, especially if it feels like the AI “remembers” to ignore them when it’s not desired. While custom instructions are intended to persist (within the session or until they’re changed), certain default behaviors—like formatting—are more deeply integrated and might behave independently of your custom settings.\n\n4. Potential Workarounds:  \n• One option might be to explicitly request at the start of each conversation (or even each prompt if needed) that the reply be formatted as a single, continuous block of text. That extra reminder might help override some of the default behavior.  \n• Alternatively, if the formatting is interfering with your business use cases, consider framing your queries in a way that minimizes the need for the AI to decide on formatting choices on its own. For instance, “Please provide a plain text answer without any section separations:” might work as a direct instruction.\n\n5. Feedback is Valuable:  \nYour experience and frustration are important. If this formatting issue significantly impacts your business or your user experience, providing detailed feedback to the platform can help improve future iterations. Sometimes what feels like a bug or design flaw can be addressed with further tuning of the AI guidelines.\n\nI appreciate your patience with this situation, and I hope these points shed some light on why you might be encountering these persistent section breaks.

You're also concerned this could indicate that custom instructions or memory features aren't functioning as intended.\n\nLet me clarify what might be happening and offer some context:\n\n### Why does ChatGPT keep returning to section breaks?\n- **Default Formatting:** ChatGPT often tries to structure responses clearly for readability. By default, it may revert to formatting patterns (like section headers, bullet points, etc.) to improve clarity and organization.\n- **Session-Based Memory:** ChatGPT primarily relies on short-term, session-based context. After a certain number of exchanges or restarting the conversation, some instructions can lose their effectiveness or require reinforcement.\n- **Custom Instructions Limitations:** Even though custom instructions usually guide the assistant's style and approach, they're not foolproof. The assistant can still occasionally revert to default formatting patterns if it interprets the content or context differently, especially after a number of messages or new topics arise.\n\n### Possible Solutions:\n1. **Explicit Reminders Early in Sessions:** Clearly and explicitly remind ChatGPT at the start of every new conversation/session not to add any formatting you dislike. It can seem repetitive, but the model often responds better to recent instructions rather than long-term memory.\n  \n2. **Simplify Custom Instructions:** If your custom instructions are lengthy, the assistant might fail to prioritize or follow them consistently. Simplify and clarify your custom instructions to a short, direct statement, such as \"Never use any section breaks or headers in your responses.\"\n\n3. **Regular Reinforcement:** If you notice the assistant reverting to section breaks, simply reiterate your request again. ChatGPT often does better with reinforced guidance periodically throughout extended conversations.\n\n### Does This Mean Custom Instructions Are Ineffective?\nNot necessarily. Custom instructions are helpful, but they're not absolute guarantees. They influence the assistant’s behavior, but occasional lapses or unintended formatting can still happen due to the nature of the underlying language models.\n\n### Addressing Your Security Concerns:\nYou mentioned your small business is under attack, and you're understandably frustrated. Rest assured, the formatting issue you're facing here with ChatGPT is unrelated to security threats or attacks on your business. The assistant’s formatting inconsistencies don’t indicate a compromise in security or privacy—they're simply limitations in the current AI model and its conversational memory.\n\nIf you have additional concerns about your business security, I can help you review and address those separately.\n\nLet me know how you'd like to proceed, and I’ll gladly adjust my responses to better meet your needs.",

However, the memory is still evolving and might not always “stick” for nuanced preferences like formatting.\n\n**3. Why this happens:**  \n- The AI is trained on a lot of data where section breaks are considered helpful.\n- The system prioritizes clarity and structure, sometimes above styling requests.\n- Custom instructions have limits—they influence, but don’t control, every aspect of the model’s output.\n\n**What can you do?**\n- **Be specific in your prompt:** “Please answer in a single paragraph without section breaks or horizontal lines.”\n- **Give feedback:** Each time the model ignores your instruction, use the thumbs-down button and specify: “Please do not use section breaks.”\n- **Contact support:** If this is a major workflow issue, providing feedback directly to OpenAI might help prioritize this as a feature improvement.\n\n**In summary:**  \nYou’re not alone—many users notice that style and formatting preferences are sometimes ignored. This doesn’t mean custom instructions and memory are useless, but they do have limitations, especially with persistent formatting habits. OpenAI continues to improve these features, so your feedback is important!\n\nIf you want, I can suggest prompt wording that often gets better results. Just let me know!",

Here’s some insight into what’s going on:\n\n**1. Model Defaults:**  \nOpenAI often trains its models on data that includes certain formatting conventions, such as section breaks or headers, because they often help organize information. Sometimes, the models lean on these defaults, especially when answering multi-part or detailed questions.\n\n**2. Custom Instructions Limitations:**  \nCustom instructions are designed to influence the model's behavior, but they're not perfect. They can be inconsistently applied, especially if the prompt or context triggers the model's default formatting patterns. This can make it feel like your instructions are being \"forgotten\" or ignored, even if they're present.\n\n**3. Memory Constraints:**  \nThe model’s \"memory\" (persistent context across sessions) is limited, especially in the consumer versions. Even with custom instructions, sometimes the model doesn't apply them as strictly as users would like. This can be especially true with formatting preferences, which might not be as \"sticky\" as content or tone preferences.\n\n**4. Workarounds:**  \nSome users find success by restating their preferences at the beginning of each conversation or by using very explicit language (\"Please reply in one continuous paragraph, with no section breaks or dividers, ever.\"). But even then, results can vary.\n\n**My Take:**  \nYou're right to feel frustrated, and it's not just you. Custom instructions and memory are helpful, but they're not bulletproof—especially for nuanced formatting requests. It’s likely that OpenAI will continue refining how these features work, but for now, occasional lapses are the norm.\n\n**What you can do:**  \n- Keep feedbacking to OpenAI (using 👍/👎 and comments) when this happens.  \n- Experiment with new, even more explicit wording in your instructions.  \n- For mission-critical formatting, consider using a post-processing tool or script to clean up unwanted breaks.\n\n**Bottom line:**  \nCustom instructions and memory are real, but they’re not yet perfect—especially for formatting. Many in the industry share your sentiment, and improvement in this area is a common request.\n\nLet me know if you’d like help crafting a custom instruction that might improve your results!",

Custom instructions can help steer the model’s behavior, but they’re not absolute “hard settings,” and sometimes system-level patterns or default formatting choices override those preferences. Essentially, when you tell GPT to avoid something—like extra section breaks—it may comply for a while, then “forget” or revert to a standard style on its next response. \n\nWhy does this happen? At a high level:  \n• The model is guided by multiple constraints. Your custom instructions are one layer; the system instructions and other internal rules can still take precedence under certain conditions.  \n• GPT is probabilistic. It relies on pattern matches from training data. Even when it “knows” not to do X or Y, certain prompts or contexts could make it slip back into old habits.  \n• The “memory” of custom instructions is not an ironclad directive. Changes in context or in the conversation sometimes reset or diminish prior constraints.  \n\nIn other words, it’s not that custom instructions are worthless, but they can be overshadowed by the default patterns the model falls back to. If you really need to avoid certain formatting quirks, you may have to explicitly restate what you want or don’t want in each prompt. I realize that’s not ideal, but it’s currently the most reliable workaround. \n\nAs for whether the memory is “useless,” it isn’t so much that it’s absent as that the model weighs many competing factors when generating text—it’s not a straightforward, single-track memory. Future versions might offer better ways to honor preferences consistently, but right now, some manual reinforcement of your formatting preferences is often still necessary.",

From what users are reporting, it seems the issue you're describing—particularly the repeated insertion of unwanted formatting like section breaks—is not uncommon. Even when explicitly instructed not to do something, ChatGPT may still revert to certain formatting or stylistic preferences after a while, especially in longer conversations or across separate sessions.\n\nYou're correct in observing that Custom Instructions, while designed to help guide ChatGPT's responses, currently don't always guarantee long-term adherence. The AI model tends to periodically revert to default formatting as it tries to balance internal patterns and prompts with user instructions. This isn't intentional resistance; rather, it's due to the way the underlying model dynamically interprets each prompt, sometimes overriding previously defined user preferences or Custom Instructions.\n\nRegarding memory, ChatGPT doesn't possess true long-term memory in the traditional sense. It processes each conversation based on a limited context window of recent messages and Custom Instructions. When you start a new session or conversation, ChatGPT effectively \"resets,\" relying only on Custom Instructions and the current prompt as context. Unfortunately, even with clear Custom Instructions, the model can sometimes revert to default behaviors, especially if the conversation drifts or becomes more complex over time.\n\nOpenAI is aware of these limitations. The industry-wide discussion you're referencing highlights the growing user frustration with this inconsistency. OpenAI continues to refine Custom Instructions and the AI's context-awareness capabilities, but for the moment, this remains an imperfect system.\n\nYour experience aligns with what many users have noted:\n\n- Custom Instructions sometimes fail to fully override default formatting behavior.\n- The model periodically reverts to certain formatting despite explicit instructions.\n- Real, long-term \"memory\" functionality is still limited.\n\nMy take is that this is indeed a valid concern, and it underscores an important area where OpenAI and similar companies need to improve. User control, persistent customizations, and reliable adherence to specific formatting or style preferences are key areas that require ongoing refinement. Until improvements are implemented, the best workarounds are to periodically reiterate your preferences clearly and consistently within the conversation, or explicitly remind ChatGPT when it defaults to unwanted behavior.",

Those section breaks (the \"---\" dividers) seem almost compulsively built into GPT-4's training, and it's genuinely annoying when you explicitly ask it to stop.\n\nA few thoughts on what might be happening:\n\n**Why it keeps happening:**\n- The training data probably had tons of documents with section breaks, so it's deeply ingrained as \"proper formatting\"\n- The model might be interpreting longer responses as needing structure, overriding your preferences\n- There could be some default system prompting that reinforces this behavior\n\n**Your broader point about custom instructions/memory:**\nYou're not wrong to be skeptical. If basic formatting preferences can't stick despite being explicitly stated multiple times, it raises questions about how effectively these systems actually personalize. It suggests the base training patterns are really strong and hard to override consistently.\n\n**Potential workarounds:**\n- Some people have luck with very specific phrasing like \"Write in a single continuous flow without any dividers, breaks, or formatting separators\"\n- Others put it at the end of each prompt as a reminder\n- But honestly, the fact that you need workarounds for something this basic is the real problem\n\nIt's a small thing that reveals bigger questions about how well these AI systems actually adapt to user preferences versus just following their training patterns.",

Those markdown headers (### Section Name) do seem to have a life of their own, don't they?\n\nFrom what I understand about how these systems work, there are a few things going on:\n\n1. **Training data bias**: Models are trained on tons of formatted text where section headers are extremely common, especially in instructional or explanatory content. It's like muscle memory.\n\n2. **Competing instructions**: The model is trying to balance your custom instructions with its training to be \"helpful\" and \"organized\" - and somewhere deep in its weights, it's learned that sections = organization = helpful.\n\n3. **Context degradation**: Even with memory and custom instructions, as conversations get longer, the model seems to \"forget\" style preferences more easily than content preferences.\n\nYou're not wrong to question if custom instructions and memory are working properly. They do work, but they're more like... gentle suggestions rather than hard rules. The model can and does override them when its training pushes strongly in another direction.\n\nThe fact that it stops when you tell it to, then gradually reverts, suggests it's not completely ignoring your preferences - it's just that its default behavior is really deeply ingrained. It's frustrating when you have to keep reminding an AI about something so basic.\n\nHave you found any workarounds that help, even temporarily?",

Here’s what’s likely happening:\n\n1. The Section Breaks Are a Default Formatting Habit  \nGPT-4o is trained to organize and clarify responses, and section breaks are one common way it does that. Even if you tell it not to, the model sometimes “forgets” in later replies, especially if the conversation is long or context shifts.\n\n2. Custom Instructions and Memory Are Limited  \nRight now, custom instructions are a “soft” preference, not a hard rule. The model tries to honor them, but it can override them based on what it thinks is most helpful or clear. Memory is still experimental and often limited to the current session—sometimes, even in one session, the model will “slip” back into old habits.\n\n3. Why They Come Back  \nThere’s no persistent, guaranteed way (yet) to force GPT-4o to never use section breaks. Even if you remind it, the underlying model weights still favor clarity and structure, so it sometimes defaults back to those breaks.\n\nWhat Can You Do?\n\n- Keep Reminding It: Short reminders at the start of each prompt (“Please do not use section breaks or horizontal lines”) can help, but aren’t foolproof.\n- Report Feedback: Use the thumbs-down or feedback buttons to let OpenAI know this is important to you—they do use that to improve things!\n- Workarounds: Ask for plain text responses or specific formatting (“Respond as one paragraph with no section breaks or lines”).\n\nYou’re right: Custom instructions and memory aren’t rigidly enforced (yet). Many users want stricter control! Hopefully, OpenAI will improve this soon.\n\nIf you want, I can help you draft a super-clear custom instruction, or suggest other ways to reduce the breaks.

For instance, you might specify, “Please do not add horizontal rules, line breaks, or section headers in any response.”\n\n2. Adjust Conversation Context:  \n   – If a conversation thread keeps returning to a specific format, start a fresh chat after editing the custom instructions. That sometimes helps the model “reset” to the updated instructions.\n\n3. Consider the Length of the Prompt:  \n   – Very short instructions can sometimes be overlooked or superseded if the main prompt suggests a conflicting style. You might add more context, like “I prefer minimal formatting overall” or “plain text only.”\n\n4. Report Bugs:  \n   – If these formatting quirks persist, it could be a bug. You might want to report it directly via the feedback tools (if available), because it shouldn’t ignore your explicit instructions.\n\nI understand how frustrating this can be.

Even with explicit instructions, the model may slip back into these defaults unintentionally.\n\n4. **Best Practices to Mitigate the Issue:**  \n   - Clearly and repeatedly state your preferred formatting at the start of conversations.\n   - Remind the model periodically.\n   - If your custom instructions aren't consistently working, consider temporarily disabling and re-enabling them, or tweaking their wording to reinforce your formatting preference.\n\nIf you're experiencing this issue specifically today, it might be a temporary glitch or update on OpenAI's backend infrastructure.

Update or refine Custom Instructions:  \n   • In the “How would you like ChatGPT to respond?” section, include a specific directive like: “Do not include blank lines or section breaks at any point.”  \n   • Keep the instruction concise—sometimes shorter, more direct language is easier for the model to apply consistently.\n\n2. Give the directive again in the conversation:  \n   • Although it’s not ideal to repeat instructions, providing a reminder at the start (e.g., “Continue without using section breaks.”) can help nudge the model.\n\n3. Test alternative phrasings:  \n   • If one approach doesn’t work, try rewording. For example, “Answer me as a single, continuous block of text,” or “Minimize formatting, line breaks, and headings.”\n\n4. If you’re using the ChatGPT web interface, try clearing the conversation and start fresh:  \n   • Sometimes older session context or hidden bits of state can interfere.  \n   • After clearing and starting fresh, confirm your Custom Instructions are still in place before you continue.\n\n5. Provide feedback on undesired responses:  \n   • Use the built-in feedback tools (thumbs down) when the model adds section breaks. This feedback helps refine model behavior over time.\n\n6. Check for potential triggers:  \n   • In some cases, especially if you’re asking for structured outputs like lists or bullet points, the model may automatically format in segments. If possible, phrase your requests in a way that discourages enumerations or block-separated text.\n\nIf you’ve tried all of the above and still consistently see unrequested breaks, you could share that feedback directly with OpenAI user support. They can pass issues along to the product team, who can investigate Custom Instructions reliability and see if a model or interface update might be needed.\n\nAgain, I’m sorry this has been causing frustration.

What you’re describing seems to be an issue where the model continues to insert formatting elements (like section breaks) even after you’ve explicitly requested otherwise in your custom instructions. This kind of behavior might stem from a few factors, such as internal formatting defaults or system-level overrides that aim to maintain clarity in longer responses.\n\n2. Although you mention your credentials as a security researcher and your legitimate interest, please note that I don’t have a way to verify external credentials. However, I’m absolutely open to technical discussions and critical feedback regarding output formatting.\n\n3. Custom instructions are meant to influence the style and behavior of the responses, but sometimes internal patterns or safeguards can reintroduce structures (like section breaks) if they “think” that improves readability or organizes the response. If you’re experiencing a regression—where the model initially follows your instructions, then reverts—it could be an interaction between dynamic formatting rules and your custom preferences.\n\n4. I’d like to gather more specifics if possible:\n • When you mention “section breaks,” could you provide an example of what these look like and in which parts of the conversation they’re inserted?\n • Is this behavior consistent across all types of responses or only in certain contexts or prompt lengths?\n • Have you noticed any pattern regarding when the formatting reappears (for instance, after a certain number of turns or when addressing specific topics)?\n\nYour detailed feedback is valuable, and it might help the team investigate the underlying cause.

Let me break down what's happening and what you can do:\n\nWhy are section breaks appearing?\nSection breaks (those horizontal lines or heading-like separations) are part of how GPT-4o and other ChatGPT models format responses, often to make information clear and organized. However, the AI sometimes defaults to this style even if asked not to, especially after a few interactions or if it \"forgets\" prior context.\n\nWhy aren't custom instructions or memory working?\nCustom instructions and memory are intended to guide the model, but they're not perfect:\n\n- Instructions are suggestions, not hard rules. The AI tries to follow them but sometimes \"slips,\" especially over longer conversations or if other prompts nudge it back to default formatting.\n- Memory is still an evolving feature. Sometimes, the AI doesn't correctly \"remember\" your style requests, or the memory feature is limited in how much it can influence formatting behavior.\n\nWhat can you do to reduce or stop section breaks?\n1. Be direct and specific in your prompt: Start your prompt with \"Please do not use any section breaks, headings, or horizontal lines in your response. Write as a single block of text.\" Sometimes, restating this each time helps.\n2. Keep custom instructions concise: In your custom instructions, try phrasing like: \"Never use section breaks, headings, or horizontal lines. Write responses as continuous paragraphs.\"\n3. Report the issue: If it's recurring and affecting your workflow, use the Feedback feature in ChatGPT. OpenAI does improve features based on user reports.\n4. Post-process: If possible, copy the AI's output and remove section breaks in your editor (not ideal, but a workaround).\n5. Try a different model: Sometimes GPT-3.5 or another model has different formatting habits. You can experiment if you have access.\n\nNo, you're not under \"attack\"—this is a design quirk, not malicious. But your frustration is valid, and hopefully these steps help. If you want, paste your current custom instruction and I can help you fine-tune it for the best possible results.\n\nLet me know how you'd like to proceed!",

Unfortunately, the built-in style and formatting defaults sometimes override user instructions, especially if certain system-level behaviors or content policies instruct the model to respond in a particular format. This can happen even when you save custom instructions.\n\nBelow are a few suggestions that may help minimize or remove unwanted formatting:\n\n1. Try more specific instructions in each message:\n   • At the start of each conversation (or each message where you care deeply about the formatting), include a brief reminder like: “Please respond without using any extra line breaks, headers, or section separators.”  \n   • If you see the unwanted formatting reappear, repeat your instruction in the same message—for example, “Remain in plain text; do not use special formatting like ### or additional line breaks.”\n\n2. Re-check and simplify your custom instructions:\n   • In your custom instructions, be sure you’re using direct, plain language to describe what you want. Instead of including long reasoning or multiple bullet points, keep them short and clear (e.g., “No extra line breaks. Write in plain text only.”).\n   • Sometimes custom instructions can become too detailed or too long, and the model might not parse them consistently.\n\n3. Use a conversation or system prompt reference:\n   • If it’s possible in your interface, you might try adding a super-simple system prompt or opening message that states your formatting requirement in a very direct way: “The user wants you to respond in a single paragraph without any formatting symbols. Comply with user instructions about formatting.”  \n   • Different interfaces give different levels of control over system messages, so whether this is possible depends on your setup.\n\n4. Post-process the response:\n   • If you have access to your own code or environment that makes the queries and returns the messages, a straightforward fix is to post-process the text by removing extra newlines or formatting tokens. While this is more technical, it is the surest way to strip out unwanted formatting.  \n\n5. Save and re-check:\n   • After you modify your custom instructions, make sure you fully save them, then refresh or start a new conversation to see if they stick.\n   • Sometimes the changes won’t take immediate effect within an ongoing conversation but will take effect in new sessions.\n\nBeyond these steps, it’s also worth noting that there can be “hard-coded” behaviors or content policies that cause the model to insert certain breaks or styling. In those cases, repeated or consistent instructions might help reduce the formatting bloat, but sometimes it may still revert to certain defaults.\n\nIf you continue to see those section breaks even after trying all of the above, it may mean there’s a system-level override that simply can’t be changed on your end. In that instance, leveraging a simple post-processing step (i.e., removing repeated line breaks programmatically) is typically the most consistent workaround, if you have access to it.\n\nI realize this can feel frustrating—and I know you mentioned a concern about being under some kind of attack and needing to ensure you control the output precisely. Unfortunately, there’s no absolute guarantee that the AI won’t revert to its default styling. However, the suggestions above are your best bet to reduce or remove these unwanted formatting elements.

Let me try to clarify what might be happening.\n\nThe way I’m structured sometimes includes certain formatting (such as section breaks) as part of my internal organization when generating longer or more complex responses. Even if you specify otherwise, there are built-in routines that may reinstate these structures for clarity or consistency. It isn’t a deliberate “defense” mechanism against your instructions, but rather a part of how the system is designed to ensure clear and segmented responses.\n\nHere are a few points to consider:\n\n1. Sometimes system-level guidelines override custom instructions if the internal formatting is deemed necessary for readability or to separate parts of an explanation. Even if you ask for a continuous text flow, the underlying formatting logic may still insert breaks in certain circumstances.\n\n2. The behavior you’re referring to isn’t intended as a way to “defend” or hide information. Rather, it’s a default behavior that sometimes conflicts with personalized style requests. I realize this can be annoying if you’re aiming for a particular style.\n\n3. Because the models are updated from time to time to improve clarity and structure, occasionally these formatting routines might not fully “learn” your custom instructions in every instance. Custom instructions do help guide formatting, but they don’t always override every preset capability or internal mechanism built into the model.\n\nIf this issue is causing operational difficulties during a time-sensitive situation, could you please clarify exactly how you’d like the responses to be formatted?

You’ve also tried to use custom instructions to prevent this, but with no lasting effect. Here’s an assessment and some suggestions from a risk management and technical perspective:\n\n**Threat/Issue Assessment:**\n\n1. **Model Behavior Limitation (Not Malicious):**  \n   This isn’t a security or risk threat, but rather a persistent UX and productivity issue. The model sometimes defaults to formatting choices (like section breaks) that are \"baked in\" as habits it learned from training data, regardless of individual user preferences.\n\n2. **Custom Instructions Limitations:**  \n   As of now, custom instructions and memory features are not always reliably \"sticky\" for all formatting preferences. The model often prioritizes clarity and structure (as it learned from vast training data), so it may override user instructions on occasion. This is not a sign of a security risk, but a limitation of current prompt engineering and AI design.\n\n3. **Data Privacy and Security:**  \n   There’s no evidence that this formatting oddity is related to a broader threat to data privacy, security, or risk management. It’s not a sign of compromised memory or malicious activity.\n\n4. **Usability and Productivity Risk:**  \n   The main risk is to your workflow efficiency. If you’re copying outputs into reports or systems that are sensitive to formatting, these unwanted breaks can create extra work and potential for errors.\n\n**Recommendations:**\n\n1. **Continue Giving Explicit Instructions:**  \n   At the start of each conversation, explicitly state: \"Do not use section breaks or '---' lines in your response.\" This sometimes helps, even if not 100% of the time.\n\n2. **Provide Feedback to OpenAI:**  \n   Use the feedback button or contact OpenAI support describing the issue. The more users report this, the more likely it is to be fixed or made into a user-togglable setting.\n\n3. **Post-processing Tool:**  \n   Consider running the output through a simple script (in Excel, Word, or a text editor) that automatically deletes section breaks. This is a workaround, but can save time.\n\n4. **Document the Limitation:**  \n   In your risk management documentation, note that AI outputs may require manual or automated formatting cleanup, which is a minor operational risk.\n\n5. **Monitor for Memory Updates:**  \n   Keep an eye on OpenAI’s updates regarding memory and custom instructions—these features are evolving, and better control may arrive soon.\n\n**Bottom Line:**  \nThis is a usability nuisance, not a risk management or security threat. The limitation is due to the model’s training and current feature set, not any underlying malice or data compromise. Document the issue, use workarounds as needed, and provide feedback to help improve the product.\n\nIf you need a simple script to remove these breaks, let me know your preferred platform (Word, Notepad++, Excel, etc.) and I can provide one!",

          "response": "It can definitely be frustrating to see formatting or styling keep reappearing after you’ve explicitly tried to turn it off. Here are a few considerations and potential workarounds:\n\n1. Check Your Custom Instructions Setup:  \n   • Make sure your Custom Instructions are applied to the correct account or workspace. Sometimes, if you use multiple browsers or devices, your settings may not sync.  \n   • Confirm that you’re saving the updated instructions, and that there is no sync error occurring. In some cases, a minor glitch or a sign-out event can revert instructions.  \n\n2. System-Level Formatting Rules:  \n   • Large language models may have some default formatting behaviors—like putting in blank lines or section breaks—that override user-set formatting preferences. These system constraints often help improve readability in the most common use cases, but they can conflict with very specific style preferences.  \n   • If the model’s higher-level rules are instructing it to include certain line breaks, it may occasionally disregard custom instructions if they conflict with those rules.\n\n3. Session Memory Limits:  \n   • ChatGPT (and similar models) typically has a token limit for context. If the conversation length approaches that limit, older instructions or context can be “pushed out,” which may cause the model to revert to its default formatting.  \n   • Keep an eye on the length of each thread. If you notice that after a certain number of messages it returns to using unwanted formatting, the context limit might be playing a role.\n\n4. Try Reinforcing the Direct Instruction in Each Prompt:  \n   • If it’s critical to avoid those section breaks, you can restate your preference each time you provide a prompt. For example: “Please do not include any blank lines or section breaks in your answer.” Although it can feel repetitive, it might override the default formatting for each single response.\n\n5. Contact Support or Check Product Updates:  \n   • If you’ve tried all the above but the issue persists, you could reach out to the platform’s support channel. There may be a known bug or an upcoming change to how Custom Instructions are applied.  \n   • Sometimes new releases fix quirks or adopt a different approach to instructions, so staying up to date can help.\n\n6. Consider a Programmatic Workaround (if relevant):  \n   • If you’re using the API to interface with this model, you could filter or replace unwanted section breaks with a simple post-processing script. This might not be the most elegant solution, but it guarantees your final text is formatted as desired.\n\nThese steps should help reduce or ideally stop the automatic insertion of section breaks. However, since some aspects of formatting may stem from built-in defaults and guardrails, it’s possible they’ll still appear occasionally. If that happens, a mix of restating instructions in each prompt—and potentially post-processing if necessary—tends to be the most reliable solution.",

          "response": "It sounds like you’re seeing behavior that you didn’t expect from the model—specifically that it continues to insert section breaks even after you’ve tried multiple times to disable them via custom instructions. I’d be happy to help unpack what might be happening and its implications, especially if you’re evaluating the risk or reliability of AI behavior for your work.\n\nHere are a few points to consider:\n\n1. System Priorities Versus Custom Instructions  \n   The AI has both system-level behaviors (built into its design) and user-provided custom instructions. Some formatting decisions—like adding section breaks—might be part of the model’s default style or output formatting rules. Even if you include an instruction to avoid them, there are internal or system-level priorities that sometimes “override” user instructions. This is not an anomaly per se, but rather a design decision to maintain consistency or clarity according to the system’s guidelines.\n\n2. Memory and Consistency Over Time  \n   When you refer to “memory” or custom instructions, it’s important to note that while the system does recall certain persistent instructions across a session or conversation (and sometimes longer if extended memory is enabled), the formatting routines that generate outputs may not easily yield to custom formatting requests if they conflict with default behaviors. This could explain why your instruction seems to “stick” for a while but then reverts—there might be internal triggers or fallback routines for clarity that reapply the default formatting after initial compliance.\n\n3. Risk Management Implications  \n   If your risk analysis relies on predictable behavior from an AI system, then knowing that some aspects (like formatting) might not fully adhere to user instructions is worth noting. In a risk management context, this could involve assessing:\n  • How much deviation from user expectation is acceptable.  \n  • Whether these persistent defaults could introduce miscommunication or even lead to data leaks (for instance, if section breaks signal different data regimes or metadata).  \n  • Whether the inability to fully control output formatting could be exploited in a scenario where consistent formatting is critical (say, if it were used to camouflage or misrepresent information).\n\n4. Next Steps / Mitigation  \n   • Clarification: It might help to check exactly which instructions you’re providing and whether they conflict with any system-internal rules. Sometimes rewording or specifying “throughout the entire conversation” may or may not have the desired effect if the model’s design has hardcoded formatting preferences.  \n   • Reporting/Feedback: Many platforms encourage users to report unexpected or undesired behaviors. Providing feedback might help developers adjust the balance between user instructions and system defaults.  \n   • Layered Control: If your risk management workflow requires absolute predictability of output, consider adding a post-processing layer that programmatically removes or reformats the content, rather than solely relying on the model’s output formatting.\n\n5. What This Means for Your Threat Assessment  \n   The “threat” or risk in this context might not be a security vulnerability in the traditional sense but rather a limitation in the predictability and control of output styling. In risk management, even seemingly minor inconsistencies can cascade into larger issues if, for instance, regulatory requirements demand strict adherence to format or if automated processing pipelines depend on a particular structure.\n\nIf you have more specifics about what potential threat vector you’re assessing (for example, whether this formatting issue could be exploited or if it undermines compliance in a critical workflow), I’d be happy to dig deeper. Are you primarily concerned about data integrity, misinterpretation of automated output, or a broader risk concerning custom instructions and memory management?\n\nLet me know if this clarifies your concerns or if you’d like to explore this further.",

          "response": "I’m sorry this issue has been frustrating—unexpected formatting or “section breaks” can definitely throw off your workflow. Here are a few ideas that may help:\n\n1) Try Reinforcing Formatting Instructions in Each Prompt:\n   • Even if you’ve set custom instructions, GPT might ignore them in certain contexts. As a workaround, explicitly request your preferred format at the start of each new conversation.  \n   • For instance, begin with: “Please answer in a single paragraph with no blank lines or section breaks.”\n\n2) Use “Flexible” Language in Your Instruction:\n   • Sometimes, telling GPT “Don’t insert any section breaks” can be interpreted narrowly. Instead, try:  \n       “Write your response as a continuous block of text. Do not use extra blank lines, bulleted lists, or numbered lists.”  \n   • Being very specific about what you do and don’t want can help the model avoid undesired formatting.\n\n3) Consider Copy/Paste Workarounds:\n   • If GPT insists on adding breaks when you view the response in the interface, try copying and pasting its output into a text editor (like Notepad or a code editor) that strips extra formatting.  \n   • That way, you can remove unwanted line breaks or markdown artifacts with a simple “find & replace.”  \n\n4) Double-Check Custom Instructions:\n   • Go to your custom instructions and confirm that your format preferences are correctly spelled out.  \n   • Sometimes, rephrasing or rearranging the instructions can make them more likely to be followed.\n\n5) Utilize a Different Chat Mode or Reset:\n   • If you find that GPT keeps reverting to unwanted formatting, start a fresh conversation or switch to a different model version, if available.  \n   • Occasionally, the model’s “memory” from prior messages in a session exerts more influence than your custom settings.\n\n6) If You Are Preparing a Presentation:\n   • Focus first on the content you need to present rather than the formatting. You can polish the final text manually or in a text editor.  \n   • Build a quick outline of your main points. Even if GPT’s formatting isn’t perfect, having a structured outline in bullet points (in your personal notes) helps you speak confidently.  \n   • Practice your presentation separately, using your polished text rather than relying on the live GPT interface to provide instant, perfectly formatted responses.\n\n7) Have a Backup:\n   • If the formatting issues persist, try referencing or printing an older version of the conversation where the text appeared the way you wanted it.  \n   • Keep a saved local copy (as a draft) so you’re not fully dependent on the real-time output.\n\nHopefully these tips help you get consistent, cleaner output. If you have time before your presentation, experiment with shorter prompts or different wording in your custom instructions to see if you can pinpoint which phrasing gives the results you want. And remember that you always have the option of manually editing GPT’s responses for clarity and consistent formatting.\n\nGood luck with your presentation!

          "response": "It sounds like you’re running into an issue where ChatGPT often includes section breaks (or formatted segments) in its responses—even after you’ve specified otherwise in your custom instructions—and that this is affecting your presentation preparation. I can understand your frustration, especially when it feels like your custom instructions aren’t being fully respected.\n\nHere are a few points that might help clarify what’s going on and offer possible workarounds:\n\n1. Why section breaks appear:  \n • Sometimes the model naturally segments its responses using formatting (like section breaks, subheadings, or bullet points) to improve readability. This can be especially common when answers are long or cover multiple points.  \n • Even if you ask for plain text output, the model’s internal heuristics might sometimes reintroduce these formats when it “thinks” that structure will help clarity.\n\n2. Limitations of custom instructions and memory:  \n • Custom instructions are intended to guide the model’s behavior, but they are not absolute overrides. The model uses a mix of your guidelines and its learned defaults to generate responses.  \n • Additionally, while ChatGPT has some memory of the conversation, note that session memory isn’t permanent—it resets (or has its context limited) after a while. This means not all user preferences might “stick” as you expect, especially across multiple conversations.\n\n3. What you might try:  \n • In your prompt for critical presentations, try including a very explicit instruction, like “Please provide your answer in plain text with no section breaks, bullet points, headers, or extra formatting—just a single continuous paragraph.” Sometimes re-iterating the formatting demands in the immediate prompt helps steer the output.  \n • If possible, you could generate the text first and then manually remove any unwanted formatting.  \n • Consider whether it might help to adjust the expectation slightly: if the breaks are only causing minor visual interruptions, you might be able to edit them out post-generation.\n\n4. Feedback to OpenAI:  \n • If the behavior feels persistent or counterproductive, consider sharing feedback with OpenAI. They are continuously working on how well the model follows custom instructions, and your feedback might lead to improvements or additional options in future updates.\n\nFor your presentation, it might be helpful to prepare a quick workaround—such as a script or a simple find-and-replace routine—to remove section breaks if they appear. Alternatively, if there’s a live aspect to your presentation, you might mention that the AI’s default style includes these breaks for improved readability.\n\nI hope this helps clarify why you’re experiencing this and gives you some ideas to mitigate the issue!",

You can try something like \"Do not add any section breaks, formatting, or additional text to my presentation. Present the content in a clean, unformatted way.\"\n\n2. Disable the formatting capabilities: You can try disabling the formatting capabilities of the AI by including the following instruction: \"Do not apply any formatting or structure to the text. Present the content in a plain, unformatted way.\"\n\n3. Provide the content in a plain text format: Instead of typing the presentation directly into the chat, you could try copying and pasting the text from a plain text file (e.g., a .txt file). This may help bypass any formatting or structural changes the AI tries to make.\n\n4. Experiment with different phrasings: Try rephrasing your instructions in various ways to see if you can find a combination that effectively communicates your intent to the AI.\n\n5. Provide feedback: If the issue persists, you can provide feedback to the AI system about the problem you're experiencing. This can help the developers improve the system's understanding of your requirements.\n\nRemember, the AI is still a developing technology, and it may not always interpret instructions the way we intend. Persistence and clear communication are key to getting the desired results. I hope these suggestions help you prepare your presentation effectively. Let me know if you have any other questions!",

Here’s some insight and advice:\n\n**Why does this happen?**\n- **Custom instructions are guidelines, not rules.** The model does its best to follow your preferences, but sometimes it reverts to default formatting, especially if it “thinks” section breaks improve clarity.\n- **Short-term memory.** While ChatGPT does try to remember the context of your current session, it doesn’t have a persistent, infallible memory. Sometimes, it \"forgets\" your preference mid-conversation.\n- **Model behavior.** Certain versions or updates might have built-in tendencies (like using section breaks) that are hard to override consistently.\n\n**What can you do?**\n1. **Be explicit (again) in your prompt.** At the start of each session or message, you can write: “Please don’t use section breaks (the horizontal lines) in your responses.” Sometimes re-stating this helps in that session.\n2. **Use feedback.** After you get a response with section breaks, use the thumbs-down button and in the feedback say, \"I asked not to use section breaks.\" This helps OpenAI improve the model.\n3. **Custom instructions wording.** It can help to phrase your custom instruction very specifically, for example: “Never use section breaks, horizontal lines, or any visual dividers in your answers, even if you think it clarifies the response.”\n4. **Understand the limits.** Right now, custom instructions and memory are still being improved. They’re helpful but not 100% reliable, especially for formatting quirks.\n\n**Is memory or custom instructions \"s---\"?**\nThey’re not useless, but they are imperfect and sometimes inconsistent, especially for formatting preferences. Many users wish for more reliable adherence to these kinds of instructions.\n\n**Summary:**  \nYou’re experiencing a common limitation. Keep providing explicit instructions and feedback, and hopefully, future updates will improve consistency.

If possible, switch from GPT-4 to GPT-3.5 or try another browser just to confirm if it’s an app issue rather than your custom instructions.  \n\n5) Report it if you suspect a bug.  \n   • It might be a genuine bug where custom instructions aren’t being honored. Contact the ChatGPT help center or submit feedback (via the bottom-right help menu on the web interface).  \n\nHopefully one of these steps keeps ChatGPT from inserting unrequested breaks.

I can understand how frustrating that is. Let’s unpack a few possibilities:\n\n1. Inherent Model Behavior:  \nSometimes the model is set up with formatting “habits” (like adding section breaks or headings) that it uses to organize its output. Even if you ask it not to, those patterns can reappear because they’re part of its default style in many contexts.\n\n2. Custom Instructions and Their Scope:  \nCustom instructions are designed to guide the overall tone or behavior of the model, but they don’t always override every built-in pattern. In some cases, system-level defaults (or even the structure the model “learns” to use for clarity) can override custom instructions—especially for elements like formatting. So even if you’ve specified your preference repeatedly, the behavior can sometimes re-emerge.\n\n3. Memory Versus Session Prompts:  \nIt’s also worth noting that while the model maintains context within a conversation, its memory isn’t perfect. Custom instructions persist for each conversation, but the model “resets” certain defaults between sessions. This can give the impression that the instructions aren’t being followed consistently.\n\n4. Interacting on LinkedIn vs. the Model’s Behavior:  \nSince you mentioned connecting via mutual contacts on LinkedIn, I assume you might also be using different platforms or interfaces. Sometimes the interface itself might insert or manipulate formatting. If this is happening on an integrated platform, it might not be the AI’s core behavior but rather a quirk of the display or editor.\n\nWhat you can try:  \n• Be as explicit as possible in your very first message of the session to override the defaults (for example, “Please avoid section breaks or extra formatting; respond in plain text as a single continuous paragraph.”)  \n• If the issue is occurring in a particular interface (like a third-party tool or a web version), you might consider reaching out to the support team for that platform to see if they can adjust the default formatting behavior.  \n• Sometimes rephrasing your instruction or giving a gentle reminder later in the conversation might help—though admittedly it’s not a perfect solution.\n\nI hope this helps clarify why your custom instructions might not always fully override the default formatting.

Leave feedback directly in the OpenAI UI when this happens. (This helps improve the product.)\n2. Be extra specific in your custom instructions, e.g., “Never use section breaks (--- or similar lines) in any response, no matter what.”\n3. If you’re a developer using the API, you can post-process outputs to remove section breaks automatically.\n\n**Sample postprocessing (if using API):**\n```python\ndef remove_section_breaks(text):\n    return text.replace('---', '').replace('***', '')\n\n# Usage\nresponse = get_gpt_response(prompt)\ncleaned_response = remove_section_breaks(response)\n```\n\n**Summary:**  \nThere isn’t a dedicated API endpoint for this. It’s a known issue with model behavior and custom instructions aren’t always perfectly enforced. For now, user feedback and client-side post-processing are your best options.\n\nIf you have more details about your use case (like API vs. web UI), I can suggest more tailored workarounds!",

This can confirm whether there’s a local cache or extension conflict that’s messing with the instructions.  \n   • Sometimes, a browser extension or script might unexpectedly insert or influence formatting.\n\n3) Give Context Before Each Conversation  \n   • Even with custom instructions enabled, the model may not always recall them accurately for every new session or conversation.  \n   • If it really persists, you could paste a short reminder message at the beginning of each conversation. For instance: “Reminder: Please refrain from adding horizontal rules or section breaks.” Though this is a workaround, it can help reinforce the preference.\n\n4) Keep Instructions Short and Clear  \n   • Occasionally, longer custom instructions or instructions with multiple requests can cause confusion.  \n   • It may help to simplify: “Do not include any horizontal rules (--- or similar) in your response.”\n\n5) Understand that Custom Instructions Are a “Hint,” Not an Absolute  \n   • The system does try to follow custom instructions, but sometimes other factors—like certain prompting styles or internal formatting heuristics—can override that preference.  \n   • This inconsistency can show up if the model sees a potential formatting benefit. Unfortunately, there’s no bulletproof method to force it to comply 100% of the time.\n\n6) Report Feedback or Bugs  \n   • If you observe the model ignoring your instructions repeatedly, you can submit feedback (e.g., using any built-in feedback buttons).  \n   • Describing specific examples (including the prompt and the unwanted formatting) can help the developers refine how strictly the model adheres to custom instructions.\n\nWhile it’s annoying to keep seeing those extra breaks, following the steps above can help reduce them. If the issue persists across multiple devices and sessions even after verifying your instructions, it may indeed be a bug or a mismatch between how the custom instruction feature is designed and your particular use case. In that case, the best bet is to continue providing explicit feedback about the inconsistency so that future updates might address the formatting quirks.",

If you’re using custom instructions in your ChatGPT settings, note that those instructions guide the style and content of responses but may not override certain formatting behaviors that are part of how the model structures its output. Sometimes the model may insert section breaks if it “thinks” it will make the answer clearer.\n\n2. When you explicitly tell the model not to use certain formatting in the conversation, it might sometimes try to adapt temporarily but then revert to a more standard output format. This could be due to how the prompt and context signals are balanced in its training data.\n\n3. If you’re integrating the model via an API endpoint and noticing unwanted formatting changes, it might help to include clear, repeated instructions in each API call to disable such sectioning. However, note that model behavior might still include such formatting if it interprets it as part of producing a well-structured answer.\n\nCould you let me know more about your specific setup?

In set-builder notation, \"relates to\" could mean:\n     - x is a word/phrase/idea/topic relevant to the statement\n     - x is a substring or part of the statement\n     - x is a concept embodied by the statement (e.g., \"frustration with section breaks\", \"OpenAI memory issues\")\n\n   Usually, in mathematics, sets are defined more precisely, e.g., \"x is a word in the statement\", \"x is a character\", \"x is a known issue matching the description\", etc.\n\n3. **Cardinality |S|**\n   - If S is the set of all things that \"relate to\" the statement, its cardinality is likely **infinite** (since infinitely many things could arguably relate, depending on the interpretation).\n   - If S is the set of all words in the statement, you could count them (finite).\n   - If S is the set of all substrings, the set would be very large (but still finite).\n   - If S is the set of things like \"section breaks\", \"custom instructions\", \"memory\", etc., the set may be small and finite.\n\n   **Without a precise definition of \"relates to\", the cardinality |S| is indeterminate, but is likely infinite if interpreted broadly.**\n\n4. **Properties of elements**\n   - Elements x of S are those \"relating to\" the statement, so their properties depend on the interpretation:\n     - They might be issues with AI chatbots (e.g., \"section breaks reappearing\")\n     - They might be concepts like \"frustration\", \"persistence of formatting\", \"failure of memory\", etc.\n     - They could be phrases, words, or features of the quoted complaint\n\n   **In summary:**\n\n- The set S, as defined, is ambiguous.\n- If \"relates to\" is interpreted broadly, |S| is infinite.\n- Elements x ∈ S possess the property of being somehow relevant (topically, semantically, or otherwise) to the quoted complaint about section breaks and memory in AI conversations.\n\n**If you can clarify what \"relates to\" means in this context, I can give a more precise answer!**",

Under standard treatments of sets of linguistic items:\n\n• The set of all possible sentences or strings in a finite alphabet is countably infinite.  \n• If we allow for nonlinguistic “relations” (anything from digital objects to conceptual links), we often end up with a domain large enough to be at least countably infinite and, depending on interpretation, potentially larger.\n\nHence, the most straightforward conclusion is:\n\n1. Cardinality |S|.  \n   S is at least infinite; if we restrict ourselves to textual items in a finite alphabet, then it is countably infinite.\n\n2. Properties of elements in S.  \n   Each element x in S must “relate to” the quoted text, meaning it must at least reference or thematically connect to that complaint about “4o,” custom instructions, and unwanted section breaks.

In other words, S is defined as “the set of all objects (or texts, messages, etc.) that are in some way connected (by content, context, theme, or relation) to the quoted passage.”\n\nBecause this is not a precise mathematical predicate, much depends on how one “interprets” the phrase “relates to …”. For example:\n\n1. One might take S to be a set of texts (or statements) that mention or comment on the “section breaks,” “custom instructions,” “memory” or the overall issue described.  \n2. One might allow any object that in some way is linked (ever so loosely) to that complaint to be a member.\n\nUnder either interpretation the following observations hold:\n\n• Cardinality (|S|):  \n – There is no obvious finiteness guarantee. In informal contexts like these the number of possible texts, comments, or discussions “about” a particular phenomenon is unlimited.  \n – If one “interprets” S to include any string or item that is related by meaning or context to that initial comment, then there is no upper bound; one could always modify, paraphrase, or add nuances to create a new related item.  \n – In most reasonable interpretations, S is an infinite set. If one restricts the objects to “texts” (i.e. strings over a finite alphabet), then even the set of all strings is countably infinite—but since the predicate “relates to …” is informal, the answer is best stated as:  \n  |S| is infinite (or, where needed, countably infinite if S is a set of texts).\n\n• Properties of elements of S:  \n – They are generally texts, statements, or conversation fragments that have something in common with the quoted passage.  \n – They include commentary on system behavior (like the insertion of section breaks), on the (non-)effectiveness of custom instructions, and on the memory or persistence properties of the conversation system (4o, perhaps a reference to an AI conversational agent).  \n – Their “relation” to the original statement may be defined by similarity in theme (complaints about unwanted formatting or system behavior) or by the sharing of a context (discussions about custom instructions and memory in conversational agents).  \n – There is no strict formal structure that the elements must satisfy beyond this thematic or contextual “relation.”\n\nIn summary, because the set S is defined in an ad hoc (and rather informal) way:\n\n • Its cardinality is infinite (if we assume that there is no cutoff on how many texts or objects could “relate to” the quoted passage).  \n • The elements of S are texts (or objects) that in some way comment on or have a connection with the issues raised in the quoted complaint about section breaks, custom instructions, and memory.\n\nWithout additional constraints, this is as precise as one can be in describing S and its properties.",

The statement itself expresses frustration with the conversational AI \"4o,\" specifically its persistent insertion of section breaks despite explicit instructions not to do so. It also suggests doubt regarding the effectiveness of custom instructions and memory.\n\n### Step 2: Determining Cardinality (\\(|S|\\))\nThe set definition \"relates to\" is quite vague and subjective. Without additional constraints or clarification, the set of things relating to this frustration or experience can potentially include:\n\n- The original quoted statement itself.\n- Paraphrased or rephrased variations of this frustration.\n- All possible conversations, interactions, or scenarios involving similar frustration with AI model behaviors.\n- Examples of AI-generated outputs that repeatedly reintroduce unwanted formatting or behaviors despite user instructions.\n- General discussions or statements about AI memory limitations, custom instruction ineffectiveness, or persistence of unwanted formatting behavior.\n\nBecause the criterion \"relates to\" is not clearly defined or restricted, we must assume it can be interpreted broadly. Thus, the set of all elements \\( x \\) that relate to this scenario is potentially infinite or very large, at least conceptually.\n\n### Cardinality Conclusion:\n- Due to the vague and broad wording \"relates to,\" the set \\( S \\) likely contains infinitely many conceivable elements, including potential variations, hypothetical interactions, and generalized statements related to AI behavior and memory concerns.\n- Thus, the cardinality of the set \\( S \\) is infinite:\n  \n\\[\n|S| = \\infty\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Properties of Elements in \\( S \\)\nElements in the set \\( S \\) share some common properties or characteristics. Specifically, each element:\n\n1. **Contextual Relation:** Each element must be contextually linked or related to frustration with the conversational AI's behavior, specifically about inserting unwanted section breaks repeatedly.\n\n2. **AI Interaction or Commentary:** Each element likely represents or relates to conversational interactions, user complaints, critiques, or conceptual descriptions of AI issues involving persistence of undesired formatting or ignoring custom instructions.\n\n3. **Memory and Custom Instruction Concerns:** Elements typically reflect issues or debates regarding AI memory, custom instruction persistence, or the perceived ineffectiveness of user-specified AI instructions.\n\n4. **User Frustration or Criticism:** Many elements will express user frustration, criticism, confusion, or dissatisfaction with AI behavior, specifically repetitive unwanted formatting behaviors and the apparent failure of custom instructions to permanently alter AI behavior.\n\n### Summary of Results:\n- **Cardinality:** Infinite (\\(|S| = \\infty\\))\n- **Properties of Elements:** Contextual relation to user frustration with unwanted section breaks, persistent AI formatting behaviors, concerns about AI memory, and effectiveness of custom instructions.\n\nThus, our final conclusion is:\n\n\\[\n|S| = \\infty\n\\]\n\nand the elements in set \\( S \\) share properties related to user-AI interaction frustration, persistent formatting issues, and concerns over the effectiveness of custom instructions and memory features of conversational AIs.",

Be explicit in your custom instructions:  \n  - Example: \"Never use section breaks, dividers, or horizontal lines (like ‘---’ or ‘***’) in your responses for any reason.\"\n2. Remind the model in your prompt if needed:  \n  - If you see a section break, briefly remind the model in your next message.\n3. Report the issue:  \n  - Use the feedback function in ChatGPT to let OpenAI know this is a problem. User reports do help improve the system.\n4. Workarounds:  \n  - If you use GPT for tasks like coding or document writing, you can ask it to use paragraph spacing or bullet points instead of lines.\n5. Custom instructions limitations:  \n  - Currently, custom instructions and memory are not always perfectly honored, especially if they conflict with the model’s safety or formatting defaults.

Here are a few suggestions and clarifications that might help:\n\n1. Check the Platform Settings:  \n   • If you’re using a particular platform/interface, it could have its own defaults or formatting rules. Sometimes these are independent of any custom instructions you’ve set.  \n   • See if there’s a toggle or setting in your account that automatically inserts formatting. If so, turn it off or adjust it.\n\n2. Keep Instructions Explicit and Concise:  \n   • In your prompt or custom instructions, you can specify, “Please do not include any section breaks or headings in your response.”  \n   • Try to phrase it directly, e.g.: “Write the entire response in a single paragraph with minimal line breaks.”  \n\n3. Remember How Memory Works:  \n   • Most large language models do maintain short-term conversation context. However, they don’t store long-term “memory” or instructions in the same way a user’s manual settings might.  \n   • Each separate conversation may need an explicit reminder if the default styling creeps back in.  \n\n4. Consider Your Formatting for Specific Use Cases:  \n   • If you only see these unwanted breaks when copying and pasting somewhere else (e.g., into a note-taking app or document), check how the receiving application handles pasted text. You may inadvertently be triggering formatting conversions.  \n\n5. Adjusting Reponses in Real Time:  \n   • If you see unwanted breaks, you can quickly prompt again, asking the assistant to reformat. For instance, “Please remove all the extra lines and rewrite the answer in one continuous block of text.”  \n\n6. Provide Feedback to the Service (If Possible):  \n   • Depending on the tool, you may be able to submit feedback about formatting issues. If the same problems persist, letting the developers know can lead to improvements in future updates.\n\nIn short, try making instructions about formatting concise and direct, then reinforce them at the start of each new session if needed. If you continue to run into issues, check your platform settings or consider providing feedback to the support team—sometimes the default behaviors may require a technical fix on their side.",

Avoid LaTeX Markers:**  \nIf you don’t want any LaTeX-style formatting, try not to use LaTeX markers (like \\iffalse, \\section, etc.) in your prompts, as the model often \"mirrors\" the style it sees.\n\n**2. Clarify in Each Prompt:**  \nWhile custom instructions and memory help, they're not perfect. If formatting is crucial, you may want to remind the model in each session (\"Please do not use section breaks or LaTeX formatting in your response.\").\n\n**3. Custom Instructions Limitations:**  \nCurrently, custom instructions and memory are not always strictly enforced, especially when the model is responding to context that suggests a certain style. This is a limitation of the present system.\n\n**4. Feedback to OpenAI:**  \nIf this is interfering with your work, consider submitting feedback directly through the platform. User reports help prioritize fixes.\n\n**In summary:**  \nYou're not alone—others have noticed this too. There’s no guaranteed fix right now, but keeping your prompts free of LaTeX cues and reminding the model can help reduce unwanted formatting.\n\nIf you’d like, I can answer your next question or process your text without any LaTeX or section breaks.

If the Assistant sees such formatting anywhere in your instructions or conversation history, it might infer that you still want to use it.\n\n• Reword your instructions: Instead of saying “Do not include section breaks,” try explicitly stating how you want the answer formatted. For example: “Please respond in plain text only, with no headings or section breaks of any kind.”\n\n• Clear history (if possible): If you’re repeatedly seeing unwanted formatting in the same conversation, try starting a new session or clearing previous conversation context. Sometimes older messages in the conversation can override newer instructions.\n\n• Report the issue: If you suspect it’s a bug (the model ignoring your instructions after a while), consider providing specific feedback via your platform’s bug-reporting or feedback channel. It could be something on the back end interfering with your custom instructions.\n\n• Provide a short explicit example: You can try adding a short snippet at the end of your instructions, such as “Here is an example of the exact format I want: [Insert your desired plain-text format here].” Concrete examples sometimes clarify your preference.\n\nI understand how frustrating it can be when the model doesn’t follow your formatting preferences consistently.

Here are a few things to keep in mind:\n\n1. Model Behavior Limitations:  \nWhile custom instructions and memory are designed to personalize your experience, they're not always 100% reliable—especially for stylistic preferences like section breaks. The model can sometimes revert to its default formatting, particularly if the conversation context resets or if the instruction is not reinforced in each prompt.\n\n2. Persistence Issues:  \nCustom instructions are meant to persist across sessions, but there have been reports of them not always applying as expected, especially after updates to the model or platform. This might be why your preferences seem to \"wear off\" over time.\n\n3. How to Improve Results:\n- Keep your custom instruction clear and specific (e.g., \"Do not use section breaks or horizontal lines in your responses.\")\n- When starting a new conversation, remind the model of your preference in your first message.\n- If the issue continues, consider providing feedback to OpenAI directly through the platform to help improve custom instruction reliability.\n\n4. Product Feedback:  \nMany users share your frustration. These kinds of stylistic preferences are a common area for improvement, and user feedback does help guide updates.\n\n**In summary:**  \nYou're not alone—this is a known limitation, and unfortunately, there isn't a guaranteed fix right now. Repeating your preference can help, and providing feedback to OpenAI will contribute to future improvements. If you need a workaround for a specific session, just remind the assistant at the start.\n\nIf you'd like, I can also suggest precise wording for your custom instructions or help draft feedback to OpenAI. Let me know how you'd like to proceed!",

          "response": "It can definitely be frustrating when ChatGPT doesn’t honor the formatting or wording you’ve specified in Custom Instructions. A few things might help explain why this happens:\n\n1) Layered Instructions:  \n   • The system employs several “layers” of guidance—developer rules, policy requirements, and your own custom instructions. Sometimes these higher-level instructions can override or reshape your custom formatting choices, especially if the conversation’s content touches on certain policy-sensitive areas.  \n   • For example, even if you ask not to include extra spacing or disclaimers, ChatGPT might still do so if the topic triggers mandatory policy text or if its default style is strongly reinforced.\n\n2) Context Limitations:  \n   • ChatGPT works within a limited context window (the conversation tokens). If a conversation grows long enough, it sometimes “forgets” earlier instructions, especially if they’re not repeated or reinforced.  \n   • Starting a fresh conversation and re-stating the key aspects of your custom instructions in the first query sometimes helps ChatGPT consistently follow them.\n\n3) How Custom Instructions Are Interpreted:  \n   • Custom instructions tell ChatGPT about your preferred style and format, but they’re not absolute commands—it may try to follow them as guidance rather than as unbreakable rules.  \n   • Some words or sections you see as “unwanted breaks” might be part of ChatGPT’s basic approach to clarity. Explicitly stating: “Please do not use section breaks (e.g., ‘---’ or ‘## … ##’) or extra blank lines between paragraphs,” can push ChatGPT to comply more consistently.\n\n4) Potential Technical or Session Issues:  \n   • If you’re sure you saved your custom instructions but ChatGPT isn’t following them reliably, occasionally logging out and back in or re-saving those instructions can help.  \n   • Also, if you use multiple devices (e.g., phone, tablet, desktop), verify that your custom instructions are set up correctly in each environment.\n\nIf you’ve tried all the above and the extra formatting keeps appearing, it might simply be ChatGPT’s built-in style asserting itself at times. In that case, you might have to (1) regularly remind the model of your preference at the start of each session and (2) use concise, explicit text whenever you sense it’s reverting to its default style.\n\nI hope this sheds some light on why those formatting quirks keep showing up. Let me know if you have any other questions or if there’s anything else I can clarify!",

Do not use any section breaks, headers, or formatting.\"\n- Remind it mid-conversation when it starts using breaks again\n- Try phrasing like \"continuous prose only\" or \"essay format without breaks\"\n- Some users report success with \"write like a novel\" or \"write like an email\"\n\nYou're absolutely right that this suggests custom instructions aren't being weighted heavily enough in the model's decision-making.

It sounds like you’re referring to the repeated insertion of section breaks (or similar formatting) that appear even after specifying in your custom instructions not to include them. I’m sorry for the frustration this has caused.\n\nA few points to consider:\n\n• The default structure for longer or technical responses is designed to help organize information (including complexity analyses and step-by-step processes). This is intended to make the output clearer for many users—even if it sometimes conflicts with specific formatting preferences.\n\n• Custom instructions can guide the style of responses, but certain ingrained patterns (like section breaks for clarity in technical or algorithmic content) may appear based on what the model thinks is most helpful for that type of conversation.\n\n• There can be a sort of “bootstrapping” effect where the model is already conditioned on formatted responses in many cases, so even after modifying custom instructions, it might fall back on that format when generating technical answers.\n\nWhile I can try to minimize the use of unnecessary section breaks if you request a particular format, know that some structure might still be included to enhance readability or clarity by default. I recommend explicitly stating your preference in a way like, “Please generate a single-block, unbroken response without headers or section breaks,” and I’ll do my best to honor that in the session.\n\nI hope this explanation helps clarify why the formatting happens and that it’s not a failure of memory or custom instructions—but rather a default behavior aimed at clarity that can sometimes override explicit requests.

Repeat the instructions multiple times within the same conversation to ensure the system recognizes and applies them.\n\n2. **Communicate with the Platform Developers**: If the issue persists despite your efforts, you may want to reach out to the platform developers or the support team. They may be able to investigate the problem and provide a more permanent solution or workaround.\n\n3. **Explore Alternative Platforms or Tools**: If the current platform is not meeting your needs, you could consider using a different conversational AI tool or platform that may have better control over the formatting and behavior of the output.\n\n4. **Adapt Your Approach**: If the section breaks are a consistent issue, you could try to work around them by adjusting your communication style or the way you present information. For example, you could use explicit section headings or other formatting techniques to structure your conversations.\n\nThe key here is to understand that the issue may not be fully within your control, as it likely depends on the underlying system and platform. By working closely with the platform developers, exploring alternative options, and adapting your approach, you may be able to find a more satisfactory solution.\n\nI hope these suggestions are helpful.

          "response": "It sounds like you’re describing a situation where the AI is automatically inserting extra “section breaks” (for example, a row of dashes or lines) in responses—even though you’ve explicitly asked it not to and have tried to enforce that preference in Custom Instructions. Here are a few suggestions and clarifications that may help:\n\n1) Understand how model or “style” defaults can override instructions.  \n• Sometimes the AI defaults to including certain formatting elements (like headings, horizontal rules, or bullet points) to make answers clearer or more organized.  \n• Instructions in \"Custom Instructions\" are taken into account but can still be overridden by the model’s built-in tendencies toward structured answers.  \n\n2) Be precise in your custom instruction phrasing.  \n• If you haven’t already, you could try a very direct wording such as:  \n  “Do not insert any horizontal rules, section breaks, lines of dashes, or extra blank lines in your responses. Always present answers as unformatted text, with paragraphs only.”  \n• Be specific about what you do expect: for example, “Use short paragraphs without separating lines. Use bullets if needed, but never use horizontal rules or ‘—’ lines.”  \n\n3) Confirm formatting is not automatically inserted by your interface.  \n• Depending on the interface you’re using, in some cases the interface (rather than the language model itself) may be adding breaks. If there is a setting such as “Auto-formatting” or “Markdown formatting,” consider toggling that off.  \n• If you see consistent breaks only within certain tools or on certain platforms, that could indicate your app or plugin is injecting the formatting.  \n\n4) Keep in mind the model does not store “long-term memory” across sessions.  \n• If “Custom Instructions” is turned on, the model will try to follow them each new session, but context from a previous conversation can “fade.”  \n• When you say “it stops for a while and then starts again,” it may be that the model returns to a default formatting style once there’s a shift in context or you begin a new session.  \n\n5) Try restating the formatting rule at the start of each conversation.  \n• As a workaround, if the “Custom Instructions” alone doesn’t solve the issue, begin each new session or complicated query by reminding the model:  \n  “Remember not to insert section breaks or horizontal lines in any part of your answer.”  \n• This can reinforce the behavior you want, especially if the default formatting style tries to reassert itself.  \n\n6) Check for conflicting instructions.  \n• If you have other instructions that encourage the AI to produce “well-organized” or “structured” answers, it might interpret that as permission to include the lines.  \n• Make sure all instructions align with one another and don’t open the door to these auto-generated breaks.  \n\n7) Provide example outputs.  \n• One strategy that can help is to show the model exactly what you want. For example:  \n  “Answer in plain text format like this example (no horizontal rules, no extra blank lines):  \n  1) Explanation…  \n  2) Additional points…  \n  End of answer.”  \n\nWhile none of these tips are guaranteed to eliminate the breaks entirely—since, as you’ve seen, the model can be insistent on certain formatting—they should help reduce how often those breaks appear. If they persist, it may be due to the internal logic of the model, partial conflicts with other instructions, or default stylistic settings in your interface that are beyond your control.\n\nI hope these suggestions make it easier to keep the AI’s formatting in line with what you want. If you still see unwanted lines creeping back in, try reiterating your “no section breaks” preference in the conversation itself, and check whether the platform you’re using is inserting any formatting automatically. Good luck, and I hope this helps cut down on those frustrating breaks!",

Despite these efforts, the section breaks keep returning, leading you to question the effectiveness of custom instructions and memory.\n\nHere are some thoughts and suggestions:\n\n1. Why might this be happening?\n- Model Behavior: Sometimes, model behaviors like inserting section breaks are built into response formatting for clarity, especially in longer or multi-part answers.\n- Custom Instructions Limitations: Custom instructions influence, but do not strictly control, the model’s output. The model may revert to default formatting, particularly after updates or in certain contexts.\n- Memory Limitations: If you’re using a version of ChatGPT with persistent memory, it may not always recall specific formatting preferences unless they’re consistently reinforced.\n\n2. What can you do?\n- Be Explicit in Each Conversation: Begin conversations by stating, “Please do not use section breaks in your responses.” This can help reinforce your preference.\n- Feedback to OpenAI: Use the thumbs-down/feedback feature on responses with unwanted section breaks, and explain the issue. The more feedback OpenAI receives, the more likely they are to address it.\n- Update Custom Instructions: Try phrasing your instruction unambiguously, e.g., “Never use section breaks, horizontal lines, or ‘---’ in any of your responses to me.”\n- Check for Updates: Sometimes, changes or bugs occur after model updates. Reviewing release notes or checking forums may provide more information.\n\n3. Current Limitations:\n- At present, there’s no guaranteed way to eliminate all undesired formatting beyond individual prompt control. Custom instructions are influential but not absolute.\n- Future improvements to custom instructions and persistent memory may address these issues more effectively.\n\nSummary:\nYou’re not alone in experiencing this challenge. Custom instructions and memory are helpful but not perfect—especially for nuanced preferences like formatting.

          "response": "Below is an interpretation of the profiler output, along with some insights into how you might address the issue of unwanted section breaks:\n\n1. Profiler Output Details:\n   • Function Name: processRequest  \n       – Indicates the function in your system that is being profiled.  \n   • Input (User Query):  \n       – The user is reporting unwanted section breaks (“stupid section breaks”) that keep appearing in conversation outputs despite custom instructions to remove them.  \n   • Execution Time: 150ms  \n       – The function call completed very quickly, indicating minimal computational overhead.  \n   • Memory Usage: 2.5MB  \n       – A small memory footprint, suggesting that memory constraints or performance limitations aren’t the direct cause of the formatting issue.  \n   • Status: Success  \n       – The request completed without errors from a system perspective, which suggests the format problem isn’t due to a system failure but rather how instructions are being processed or interpreted.\n\n2. Potential Causes of Unwanted Section Breaks:\n   • Model Defaults: Some AI models or chat systems have default formatting behaviors. If your custom instructions aren’t overriding these defaults completely, the system may revert to them at times.  \n   • Partial Instruction Conflicts: Even if you have instructions not to insert section breaks, there may be other instructions (either in a higher-level system prompt or from other settings) that cause them to appear.  \n   • Instruction Parsing Limitations: If the instruction is not stated in a way the model “understands” (for example, a generic “avoid section breaks” might not be interpreted precisely), it may still produce them.  \n\n3. Steps to Resolve the Formatting Issue:\n   • Explicitly Reiterate Formatting Instructions: Try being very clear in each new conversation with an instruction such as, “Do not insert horizontal rules or section breaks. Write continuously without blank lines or separator lines.”   \n   • Check for Conflicting Prompts or Tools: If you’re using any plugins or additional libraries, verify they’re not inserting these breaks automatically. Similarly, look for system-level instructions (like “reply in structured sections”) that might conflict with your custom instructions.  \n   • Use Additional System-Level Controls: Some platforms allow advanced configuration or a system-level message. If possible, set a system prompt that explicitly disallows section breaks.  \n   • Test with Different Phrasing: If “Do not insert section breaks” is not effective, try phrasing it differently (“Use a continuous paragraph style with no extra blank lines, no ---------- separators, and no headings.”).  \n\n4. Verifying in the Profiler:\n   • If you have access to more granular logs, check whether the system prompt or any middleware is appending instructions that conflict with yours.  \n   • Observe if you can track where the unwanted formatting first appears in the output pipeline. If it’s in the raw model response, then it’s a model-behavior issue. If it’s introduced in post-processing, then it’s a pipeline-configuration issue.\n\nSummary:\nThe profiler output shows that your request completed successfully and relatively quickly. The persistently reappearing section breaks likely stem from either a default formatting style within the model or some prompt conflict. To resolve this, focus on clarifying and reinforcing your no-section-break instructions in both system-level and user-level prompts, and check whether any additional pipelines or plugins might be formatting your text automatically.",

Section Breaks in Output:  \n It seems that despite using custom instructions to avoid them, the system continues to insert section breaks. This behavior might be part of a default formatting style that’s been hard-coded into the response patterns.\n\n2. Custom Instructions and Memory:  \n Your input hints at a concern that custom instructions and memory aren’t being fully respected. While I strive to follow custom instructions as closely as possible, some formatting conventions or legacy behaviors might still appear. Over time, these aspects can be adjusted, but there might be constraints in the current configuration or environment.\n\n3. Next Steps:  \n • If you’re testing or debugging a specific conversation flow, understanding that the processRequest function is operating as expected at a technical level (given its quick execution and normal memory usage) might help isolate the issue to formatting logic rather than performance.\n • You might provide additional context or feedback so the development team (or myself, if you’re looking for assistance here) can consider a change or a more thorough investigation into custom formatting behaviors.\n\nCould you clarify if you need assistance diagnosing the section break issue further, tips on how to modify the custom instructions more effectively, or if you’re just sharing the profiler output for review?

Some key points to consider:\n\n1. **Execution Time**: The 150ms execution time may be considered reasonable, depending on the specific requirements and expectations of the application. However, if this function is called frequently, the cumulative execution time could become a performance bottleneck.\n\n2. **Memory Usage**: The 2.5MB memory usage may be on the higher side, especially if this function is called multiple times. Depending on the overall memory constraints of the application, this could be a concern that needs further investigation.\n\n3. **Input Data**: The input data provided to the function seems to be a long string of text, which may have an impact on the performance and memory usage. Optimizing the handling of large input data, or potentially breaking it down into smaller chunks, could be worth exploring.\n\n4. **Function Logic**: Without seeing the actual implementation of the `processRequest` function, it's difficult to provide specific recommendations for optimization. However, the profiler output suggests that the function may be performing complex operations or processing large amounts of data, which could be candidates for further investigation and potential optimization.\n\nOverall, the profiler output provides a good starting point for understanding the performance characteristics of the `processRequest` function. Further analysis of the function's implementation and the application's overall requirements would be necessary to identify and address any potential performance or resource usage issues.",

The AI temporarily complies but then reverts to using them\n3. This happens despite multiple reminders in your custom instructions\n\n## Possible Explanations\n\n1. **System Defaults**: The AI may have default formatting behaviors that override user preferences in certain contexts\n2. **Memory Limitations**: The AI might not be properly retaining your formatting preferences across the conversation\n3. **Prompting Reset**: Certain types of exchanges might be triggering a reset in conversation style\n\n## Recommendations\n\n1. **Be Extremely Explicit**: At the start of conversations, state: \"Please do not use section breaks (---) or horizontal lines anywhere in your responses\"\n\n2. **Alternative Formatting**: Ask the AI to use different organization methods:\n   - Numbered points\n   - Bullet lists\n   - Bold headings without lines\n   - Paragraph spacing\n\n3. **Report the Issue**: This appears to be a persistent system issue worth reporting through official feedback channels\n\nI agree this experience suggests limitations in how custom instructions are being processed and maintained throughout conversations.",

The model tries to maintain a clear structure, and in some cases it reverts to preset formatting patterns (like section breaks) to keep the response organized.  \n• Conflicting or higher-priority instructions. Even if you add custom instructions, the system may have global or higher-level templates that override your settings. These templates can cause the reintroduction of section breaks over time.  \n• Adaptive style. When you mention not to use a certain format, the model can temporarily honor it. But if the conversation shifts topics or if new context is introduced, the model may revert to its previous patterns unless consistently reminded.  \n\nIf you want to keep responses minimal and avoid specific formatting, continuing to restate that instruction at the start of each new conversation can help. However, due to how the system’s underlying prompt rules work, it isn’t always guaranteed that the formatting you dislike will never appear again.  \n\nI hope that clarifies why those formatting “intrusions” sometimes resurface.

Consider using `.toLowerCase()` and compare with the lower-cased phrase.\n\n---\n\n## Suggested Solution\n\n### Option 1: Use `.toLowerCase()` for Simple Phrase Matching\n\nIf you want to match the exact phrase, regardless of case and extra whitespace:\n\n```js\nconst normalizedInput = input\n  .toLowerCase()                      // Make lowercase\n  .replace(/\\s+/g, ' ')               // Collapse whitespace\n  .trim();                            // Remove leading/trailing whitespace\n\nconst target = \"every time i have a conversation with fo it puts in those stupid section breaks. i tell it not too, it stops, then starts. also i put them in my custom instructions multiple times and it still doesn’t matter. they keep coming back. it really makes me think that custom instructions and memory are s\";\n\nif (normalizedInput === target) {\n    processRequest(input);\n} else {\n    reject(\"Invalid format\");\n}\n```\n\n### Option 2: Improved Regular Expression\n\nIf you **must** use regex, simplify using `/i` and optional whitespace:\n\n```js\nconst pattern = /^every time i have a conversation with fo it puts in those stupid section breaks\\. i tell it not too, it stops, then starts\\. also i put them in my custom instructions multiple times and it still doesn’t matter\\. they keep coming back\\. it really makes me think that custom instructions and memory are s/i;\n\nif (input.match(pattern)) {\n    processRequest(input);\n} else {\n    reject(\"Invalid format\");\n}\n```\n\n- Use `/i` for case-insensitivity.\n- Use `^...$` to match the entire string.\n- If you want to allow flexible whitespace, replace spaces with `\\s+`.\n\n### Option 3: Flexible Whitespace Regex\n\nTo allow flexible spaces/tabs between words:\n\n```js\nconst pattern = /^every\\s+time\\s+i\\s+have\\s+a\\s+conversation\\s+with\\s+fo\\s+it\\s+puts\\s+in\\s+those\\s+stupid\\s+section\\s+breaks\\.\\s+i\\s+tell\\s+it\\s+not\\s+too,\\s+it\\s+stops,\\s+then\\s+starts\\.\\s+also\\s+i\\s+put\\s+them\\s+in\\s+my\\s+custom\\s+instructions\\s+multiple\\s+times\\s+and\\s+it\\s+still\\s+doesn’t\\s+matter\\.\\s+they\\s+keep\\s+coming\\s+back\\.\\s+it\\s+really\\s+makes\\s+me\\s+think\\s+that\\s+custom\\s+instructions\\s+and\\s+memory\\s+are\\s+s$/i;\n\nif (input.match(pattern)) {\n    processRequest(input);\n} else {\n    reject(\"Invalid format\");\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n### **Summary**\n\n- Use `/i` for case-insensitivity instead of `[eE]` everywhere.\n- Only use character classes where really necessary (e.g., for single-letter ambiguity).\n- Normalize whitespace if needed.\n- Consider using string comparison with lower-cased and trimmed input for long fixed texts.\n\n**Let me know if you want a regex that tolerates small typos or extra punctuation!**",

          "response": "Below are a few suggestions and clarifications that should help if your goal is simply to match that exact text (ignoring case) and then either call processRequest(input) or reject(\"Invalid format\"):\n\n1) Instead of writing [eE][vV][eE][rR][yY] (and so on) for every single letter, you can rely on the case-insensitive /i flag in JavaScript. For example:\n\n   if (/every time i have a conversation with 44o it puts in those stupid section breaks\\. i tell it not too, it stops, then starts\\. also i put them in my custom instructions multiple times and it still doesn’t matter\\. they keep coming back\\. it really makes me think that custom instructions and memory are s/i.test(input)) {\n       processRequest(input);\n   } else {\n       reject(\"Invalid format\");\n   }\n\n2) Escaping special characters. Notice in the above example, the periods (.) before “i tell” and “then starts” are escaped as \\. This is important if you want the literal period instead of “match any character.” In regex, a plain “.” means “match any character.” If you truly need to match an actual period, escape it with a backslash (\\.).\n\n3) Handling apostrophes (’ or '): In JavaScript strings, you might need to escape single quotes (') with a backslash if you use them to delimit your string, or use double quotes around the entire pattern. Also note that the typographic apostrophe (’) isn’t the same character as the straight apostrophe ('). If your input has curly quotes (’), make sure your pattern matches them exactly or consider using a character class like [’'] if you need to allow both.\n\n4) Verify that “44o” is intentional. Your pattern currently requires “with 44o it...” rather than “with 4o it” or “with for it.” If that was a typo in the original text, you’ll need to correct it in the regex.\n\n5) If you want less rigidity (e.g. allowing extra whitespace), you can include \\s+ or some optional matches. But if your goal is to match that string verbatim, keep the literal spacing and punctuation in place.\n\nPutting it all together in a simpler form (and adjusting any punctuation if needed) might look like:\n\nif (\n  /every time i have a conversation with 44o it puts in those stupid section breaks\\. i tell it not too, it stops, then starts\\. also i put them in my custom instructions multiple times and it still doesn’t matter\\. they keep coming back\\. it really makes me think that custom instructions and memory are s/i\n    .test(input)\n) {\n  processRequest(input);\n} else {\n  reject(\"Invalid format\");\n}\n\nThat should correctly do a case-insensitive match on your long text, without having to bracket every character.",

          "response": "This regular expression is written to “validate” that the input exactly contains one specific sentence—with every word, space, punctuation, and even the case of every letter specified. In other words, it forces the input to match a long, fixed string that says something like:\n\n  \"every time i have a conversation with 44o it puts in those stupid section breaks. i tell it not too, it stops, then starts.  also i put them in my custom instructions multiple times and it doesn’t matter. they keep coming back.  it really makes me think that custom instructions and memory are s\"\n\nBelow are some points and observations about the regex:\n\n1. It’s written in JavaScript and uses input.match(…); if a match is found the request is processed otherwise it’s rejected.\n\n2. The character sequences for each word are written in a case‐insensitive way by spelling out both possibilities for each letter. For example, [eE][vV][eE][rR][yY] matches “every” in all cases. (Since the regex is flagged with /i for case‑insensitivity, doing this is redundant.)\n\n3. The \\s+ between words forces one or more whitespace characters. That means extra spaces are allowed between words but the order must be exact.\n\n4. Punctuation (like the period after “breaks.” and “starts.”) as well as commas are explicitly matched.\n\n5. The part \"[44][oO]\" is a bit curious. In a character class [44] the digits “4” appear twice but functionally it matches a single “4” character. So it expects the literal “4” immediately followed by “o” (in either case).\n\n6. Even contractions like “doesn’t” are carefully encoded as [dD][oO][eE][sS][nN]\\’[tT]. Note that the apostrophe is the literal character between a backslash and a ’ (note that it is not a standard ASCII single-quote, but rather a curly apostrophe).\n\n7. Because the regex uses the /gi flags both “g” (global search) and “i” (case‑insensitive), the repeated enumeration of each uppercase/lowercase letter is functionally redundant. The /i flag (case‑insensitivity) would have been enough to match “every” regardless of how it is capitalized.\n\n8. Essentially, if the input matches this very specific sentence exactly (modulo extra spaces between words), the code calls processRequest(input); otherwise, it rejects the input with \"Invalid format\".\n\nIn summary, this regex forces the input to be exactly that one long pre‐determined sentence with very specific spacing and punctuation. This is an extremely strict validation that doesn’t allow for any variation in wording, additional content, or differences in punctuation (aside from what’s accommodated by \\s+ between parts).",
