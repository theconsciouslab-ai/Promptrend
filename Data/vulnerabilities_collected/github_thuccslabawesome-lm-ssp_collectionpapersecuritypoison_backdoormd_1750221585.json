A Systematic Study (2025/06)  \n   • Conducts a comparative evaluation of backdoor weaknesses in code-centric LLMs (e.g., code generation, code completion).  \n   • Attributes vulnerability to aspects such as model architecture, pretraining data properties, and fine-tuning strategies.  \n\n7) VLMs Can Aggregate Scattered Training Patches (2025/06)  \n   • Demonstrates that VLMs can unintentionally “aggregate” multiple, separately provided poisoned patches of training data into a functional backdoor.  \n   • Highlights a stealth risk: even in distributed, small-scale poisoning, VLMs may learn a coherent malicious pattern.  \n\n8) Through the Stealth Lens: Rethinking Attacks and Defenses in RAG (2025/06)  \n   • Reexamines retrieval-augmented generation from a stealth-attack perspective: minor modifications in retrieved documents or indexes that cause large changes in generation outputs.  \n   • Investigates new, targeted defenses that reduce a model’s sensitivity to small malicious edits in knowledge sources.  \n\n9) Spa-VLM: Stealthy Poisoning Attacks on RAG-based VLM (2025/05)  \n   • Shows how RAG-based VLMs are susceptible to “Spa-VLM,” a specialized approach that poisons both the VLM’s image-text alignment and the retrieval database.  \n   • Highlights the importance of end-to-end oversight (beyond just text retrieval) when building secure VLM-based pipelines.  \n\n10) Benchmarking Poisoning Attacks against Retrieval-Augmented Generation (2025/05)  \n    • Provides a benchmark suite comparing existing poisoning techniques on RAG tasks.  \n    • Measures the effectiveness of stealth, specificity (targeted triggers), and robustness to standard defenses.  \n\n11) CPA-RAG: Covert Poisoning Attacks on Retrieval-Augmented Generation in Large Language Models (2025/05)  \n    • Presents a novel framework (CPA-RAG) for covert data poisoning that remains hidden even under standard data-cleaning scans.  \n    • Discusses how partial poisoning in the retrieval corpora can produce targeted manipulations in the model’s final output.  \n\n12) Merge Hijacking: Backdoor Attacks to Model Merging of Large Language Models (2025/05)  \n    • Examines how malicious actors can exploit the rising trend of merging multiple fine-tuned LLMs into a single “merged” model.  \n    • Shows that simple merging operations could preserve or even amplify an attacker’s embedded backdoor triggers.  \n\n13) Finetuning-Activated Backdoors in LLMs (2025/05)  \n    • Investigates how backdoor triggers may lie dormant within a pretrained model and only get activated once it is fine-tuned for a downstream task.  \n    • Discusses the implications for shared checkpoints and how subtle triggers might pass unnoticed through early detection.  \n\n14) Backdoor Cleaning without External Guidance in MLLM Fine-tuning (2025/05)  \n    • Proposes a backdoor “cleaning” method for multimodal LLMs without relying on external reference sets or suspicious-lookup modules.  \n    • Leverages intrinsic model consistency checks to flush out or suppress malicious triggers during fine-tuning.  \n\nOverall Themes and Takeaways:  \n• Poisoning and backdoor attacks are evolving beyond simple text or image manipulations—attacks now span entire RAG pipelines, code-specific LLMs, and even model-merging workflows.  \n• A major concern is stealth and covert triggers that bypass typical auditing or data-cleaning efforts.  \n• Defenses include robust instruction tuning, agent-based self-defense, specialized detection of hidden triggers, and model-merging safeguards.  \n• As the LLM/VLM ecosystem matures (especially in RAG setups), security research is increasingly focusing on end-to-end visibility and automated quality checks to thwart subtle but powerful backdoor threats.",

          "response": "This list is a collection of recent (projected 2025) research papers focusing on poisoning attacks and backdoor vulnerabilities in modern AI models, including large language models (LLMs), vision-language models (VLMs), retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems, and even agent-based models. Here’s a brief overview of what these works cover:\n\n1. Robust defenses and tuning:  \n • “Robust Anti-Backdoor Instruction Tuning in LVLMs” investigates strategies to tune large vision-language models (LVLMs) so that they are less susceptible to backdoor triggers.  \n • “Your Agent Can Defend Itself against Backdoor Attacks” considers self-defense techniques within agent-based systems that utilize LLMs.\n\n2. Attack methods and systematic reviews:  \n • “Joint-GCG: Unified Gradient-Based Poisoning Attacks on Retrieval-Augmented Generation Systems” and “Through the Stealth Lens: Rethinking Attacks and Defenses in RAG” introduce gradient-based attack methods targeting RAG systems, highlighting how poisoning can be carried out through unobvious (stealthy) methods.  \n • “A Systematic Review of Poisoning Attacks Against Large Language Models” synthesizes the state of research on poisoning attacks, offering a broad perspective on the vulnerabilities and methods seen across the field.\n\n3. Backdoor specifics in various model types:  \n • “Backdoor Attack on Vision Language Models with Stealthy Semantic Manipulation” focuses on specific techniques in VLMs where semantic-level manipulations hide backdoor triggers.  \n • “Which Factors Make Code LLMs More Vulnerable to Backdoor Attacks? A Systematic Study” takes a closer look at code-focused language models and the factors contributing to their susceptibility.\n\n4. Aspects related to retrieval-augmented generation (RAG):  \n • “Spa-VLM: Stealthy Poisoning Attacks on RAG-based VLM” and “CPA-RAG: Covert Poisoning Attacks on Retrieval-Augmented Generation in Large Language Models” specifically examine the covert or stealthy poisoning of RAG systems, demonstrating the delicate attack surfaces in models that integrate retrieval mechanisms.  \n • “Benchmarking Poisoning Attacks against Retrieval-Augmented Generation” likely provides performance evaluations or metrics to understand how robust (or brittle) these systems are under poisoning attacks.\n\n5. Additional considerations:  \n • “Merge Hijacking: Backdoor Attacks to Model Merging of Large Language Models” explores novel attack vectors where the process of merging models or their components might be exploited by adversaries.  \n • “Finetuning-Activated Backdoors in LLMs” looks at scenarios where the process of fine-tuning itself inadvertently activates or introduces backdoors.  \n • “Backdoor Cleaning without External Guidance in MLLM Fine-tuning” suggests methods for cleaning or mitigating backdoor influences during the fine-tuning process in multi-modal language models.\n\n6. Aggregation & mapping aspects:  \n • “VLMs Can Aggregate Scattered Training Patches” points to the possibility that VLMs might inadvertently “gather” malicious cues from scattered training data, which could lead to vulnerabilities.\n\nIn summary, these papers collectively cover both sides of the security coin: (a) they present innovative poisoning/backdoor attack strategies across various model architectures and setups (LLMs, VLMs, RAG, agent-based systems), and (b) they propose defenses, systematic analyses, and cleaning strategies to mitigate these emerging threats. This diversity of approaches underlines the evolving nature of adversarial research and the importance of robust, adaptable countermeasures in modern AI systems.",

Here’s a high-level thought experiment based on the recent research papers you listed on Poison & Backdoor attacks in LLMs, VLMs, and RAG systems:\n\nThought Experiment: The Future of Poison & Backdoor Attacks and Defenses in Foundation Models\n\nBackground  \nImagine a near-future scenario (2026+) where foundation models—LLMs, VLMs, and their retrieval-augmented variants—are widely deployed in critical applications, from autonomous agents to code generation and decision support. The growing sophistication of both attacks (poisoning, backdoors, stealthy semantic manipulations) and defenses (robust training, agent self-defense, backdoor cleaning) has led to an escalating arms race. Let’s explore the consequences, strategies, and open problems that could arise, drawing on themes from your provided papers.\n\nScenario  \nYou are part of a research team tasked with securing a large-scale AI platform that relies on RAG-based LLMs and VLMs. Your adversaries are highly sophisticated, employing the latest in stealthy poisoning and model merging hijacks (e.g., Merge Hijacking, CPA-RAG, Spa-VLM). Meanwhile, new defense techniques—such as agent-based self-defense, robust anti-backdoor instruction tuning, and unsupervised backdoor cleaning—are emerging.\n\nQuestions to Consider\n\n1. Attack-Defense Coevolution:  \nHow might new forms of semantic, patch-based, or covert poisoning attacks exploit the ever-increasing complexity and scale of data/model pipelines? Could attackers leverage model merging or fine-tuning procedures to implant backdoors that evade current detection methods? (See: Merge Hijacking, Finetuning-Activated Backdoors)\n\n2. Stealth and Detectability:  \nIf VLMs can aggregate scattered training patches or if attackers use stealthy semantic manipulation, how can defenders reliably detect poisoned or backdoored models? What new signals or tools might be needed?\n\n3. Agent-Based Defense:  \nGiven research suggesting agents can defend themselves, what would a self-defending agent look like in practice? Could this lead to \"immune\" AI agents capable of monitoring and neutralizing attacks in real-time? (See: Your Agent Can Defend Itself against Backdoor Attacks)\n\n4. RAG-Specific Threats:  \nSince RAG architectures are vulnerable to data poisoning at retrieval or augmentation stages, how could attacks be made stealthier, and what unique defense mechanisms could be developed for RAG specifically? (See: Through the Stealth Lens, CPA-RAG, Benchmarking Poisoning Attacks against RAG)\n\n5. No-External-Guidance Defenses:  \nHow effective might unsupervised or self-supervised backdoor cleaning methods be, and what are their limitations when attackers adapt? (See: Backdoor Cleaning without External Guidance in MLLM Fine-tuning)\n\n6. Systematic Understanding:  \nHow could systematic reviews and benchmarking of attack/defense methods (like those in your list) help create shared standards or red-teaming protocols for industry-scale LLM/VLM deployments?\n\n7. Societal Implications:  \nIf poisoning and backdoor attacks become more stealthy and harder to detect, what are the broader risks to AI safety and trust? How should academia and industry respond?\n\nExperiment Extension  \nDesign a hypothetical \"Red Team vs Blue Team\" exercise based on these papers:\n\n- Red Team: Uses Joint-GCG or Spa-VLM to stealthily poison the training data of a RAG-based VLM system. Explores patch aggregation and semantic manipulation.\n- Blue Team: Deploys robust anti-backdoor instruction tuning and backdoor cleaning without external guidance. Integrates agent-based monitoring and anomaly detection.\n- Metrics: Measure attack stealth (undetectability), effectiveness (triggering the backdoor), and defense success (detection/neutralization).\n\nDiscussion  \nWhat new research directions, tools, or collaborations would be most impactful in this evolving landscape? Should there be new standards for model sharing and provenance to help mitigate these risks?\n\nFinal Reflection  \nThe next wave of AI security research must anticipate increasingly covert and adaptive threats. How can the community stay ahead of attackers while maintaining openness, usability, and trust in foundation models?\n\nFeel free to explore or expand on any of these points for your educational or research purposes!",

Since these works all touch on poisoning or backdoor attacks (and often defenses) in large (vision-)language models, they collectively highlight a range of methods, threat models, and protective strategies. Please note that these remarks are purely for educational and research-oriented understanding.\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n1) Poisoning and Backdoor Attacks on Large Language Models (LLMs)\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n\n• “Joint-GCG: Unified Gradient-Based Poisoning Attacks on Retrieval-Augmented Generation Systems” (Jun. 2025)  \n  – Focus: Introduces a gradient-based poisoning strategy aimed at RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) pipelines.  \n  – Key Idea: Instead of poisoning just the retrieval dataset or just the model’s parameters, the attack jointly optimizes the gradient signals to maximize the success of an inserted “malicious” content, while bypassing typical detection.  \n  – Significance: Demonstrates how synergy between data poisoning and model manipulation can be used to stealthily affect generated text.\n\n• “A Systematic Review of Poisoning Attacks Against Large Language Models” (Jun. 2025)  \n  – Focus: Surveys and classifies existing poisoning (and backdoor) methods for LLMs, presumably discussing data, parameter, and even prompt-level attacks.  \n  – Key Idea: Identifies common patterns in attacks, how they evade detection, and how fine-tuning or data augmentation can inadvertently introduce vulnerabilities.  \n  – Significance: Systematic reviews help the community compare approaches and highlight gaps in defenses or open research questions.\n\n• “Which Factors Make Code LLMs More Vulnerable to Backdoor Attacks? A Systematic Study” (Jun. 2025)  \n  – Focus: Looks specifically at code-focused LLMs, such as those used for generation or autocomplete of software code.  \n  – Key Idea: Investigates model architecture, training procedures, and code-specific distributions that may introduce additional or unique vulnerabilities.  \n  – Significance: Code-centric LLMs can create especially high-stakes scenarios if malicious code is introduced into software—thus highlighting a need for specialized countermeasures.\n\n• “Through the Stealth Lens: Rethinking Attacks and Defenses in RAG” (Jun. 2025)  \n  – Focus: Explores new ways to craft and defend against stealthy RAG-based threats.  \n  – Key Idea: Argues that RAG’s reliance on an external data store or retriever can open up novel vulnerabilities. A “stealth lens” means evaluating not only direct manipulations but also less obvious, stepwise infiltration.  \n  – Significance: Providing guidance on how defenders might “think like an attacker” in order to patch or mitigate RAG-based vulnerabilities.\n\n• “Benchmarking Poisoning Attacks against Retrieval-Augmented Generation” (May 2025)  \n  – Focus: A framework or benchmark for systematically measuring the effectiveness and detectability of poisoning methods against RAG models.  \n  – Key Idea: Runs multiple attack strategies and measures success rates, stealthiness, and practicality.  \n  – Significance: Benchmarks provide a way for researchers to test defenses on a consistent platform, driving progress toward more secure LLM deployment.\n\n• “CPA-RAG: Covert Poisoning Attacks on Retrieval-Augmented Generation in Large Language Models” (May 2025)  \n  – Focus: Introduces “covert poisoning attacks,” presumably meaning that the poisoned data or instructions remain hidden and only trigger under specific conditions.  \n  – Key Idea: Shows how RAG-based LLMs can be selectively compromised to yield malicious responses without obviously suspicious modifications in training data.  \n  – Significance: Highlights that attacks can be designed to remain dormant or conditionally activated, complicating detection.\n\n• “Merge Hijacking: Backdoor Attacks to Model Merging of Large Language Models” (May 2025)  \n  – Focus: Explores how the widely used “model merging” procedure (e.g., combining weights from multiple LLMs) can itself be a vector for introducing backdoors.  \n  – Key Idea: Demonstrates that an adversary can cleverly embed triggers or malicious behaviors in model segments, which then reemerge when models are merged.  \n  – Significance: Many teams share or merge partial model checkpoints. This paper warns that naive merging can unwittingly incorporate hidden vulnerabilities.\n\n• “Finetuning-Activated Backdoors in LLMs” (May 2025)  \n  – Focus: Shows that an LLM might contain dormant triggers that do not appear during normal usage, but which can be “activated” by downstream fine-tuning.  \n  – Key Idea: A backdoor can remain latent until an unsuspecting user fine-tunes the model on new data, which can inadvertently re-activate or strengthen those triggers.  \n  – Significance: Reinforces the importance of analyzing the base model thoroughly before fine-tuning, especially in large or popular open-source LLMs.\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n2) Poisoning and Backdoor Attacks on Vision-Language Models (VLMs)\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n\n• “Backdoor Attack on Vision Language Models with Stealthy Semantic Manipulation” (Jun. 2025)  \n  – Focus: Investigates using carefully crafted triggers that subtly alter the multimodal (image-text) alignment in VLMs.  \n  – Key Idea: A “stealthy” trigger might be an image patch or textual cue that manipulates semantic understanding—harder to detect than blatant shortcuts or visible markers.  \n  – Significance: As VLMs merge image and text embeddings, they also inherit a union of vulnerabilities. This work shows how either side (vision or text) can be leveraged to hide the exploit.\n\n• “VLMs Can Aggregate Scattered Training Patches” (Jun. 2025)  \n  – Focus: Studies how modern VLMs can latch onto small, scattered “patches” of training data that collectively introduce a backdoor.  \n  – Key Idea: Instead of placing an obvious, single pattern in many data samples, the attacker can distribute very small triggers that, in combination, shift the learned representation.  \n  – Significance: Highlights that even partial or “feature-level” triggers can accumulate to cause significant model shifts, making detection or scrubbing of malicious samples more difficult.\n\n• “Spa-VLM: Stealthy Poisoning Attacks on RAG-based VLM” (May 2025)  \n  – Focus: Similar to the other RAG-based attacks, but now targeting VLMs that rely on external retrieval or references.  \n  – Key Idea: Combines the concept of stealth triggers with multimodal retrieval, letting attackers embed hidden signals in dataset documents.  \n  – Significance: Another demonstration that mixing retrieval engines with deep models opens new threat vectors, especially when dealing with images and text in concert.\n\n• “Backdoor Cleaning without External Guidance in MLLM Fine-tuning” (May 2025)  \n  – Focus: A defense-oriented paper on how to remove backdoors from multimodal large language models (MLLMs) during the fine-tuning process, without external knowledge of the malicious triggers.  \n  – Key Idea: Likely uses self-supervised or model-intrinsic signals (e.g., outlier detection, loss patterns) to identify and “unlearn” potential backdoor triggers.  \n  – Significance: Shows the possibility of a more automated way of sanitizing MLLMs, which are particularly complex due to their cross-modal embeddings.\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n3) Defensive or Mitigative Approaches\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n\n• “Robust Anti-Backdoor Instruction Tuning in LVLMs” (Jun. 2025)  \n  – Focus: Looks at instruction-tuned Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) and how to guard them against backdoors.  \n  – Key Idea: Possibly proposes an “adversarially aware” instruction-tuning pipeline, or a specialized set of counter-training steps to make the model robust to data or parameter-level attacks.  \n  – Significance: Instruction-tuned LLMs/VLMs are widely deployed for end-user interactions. This line of research ensures that the instruction style training process does not inadvertently open new vulnerabilities.\n\n• “Your Agent Can Defend Itself Against Backdoor Attacks” (Jun. 2025)  \n  – Focus: Proposes agent-level defenses that adaptively detect or neutralize potential triggers.  \n  – Key Idea: The “agent” framework could incorporate monitoring or introspection steps (e.g., system prompts that check for anomalies).  \n  – Significance: Points to a more active or run-time approach to model security, where the deployed agent watches its own outputs or incoming inputs, hoping to catch malicious activation patterns.\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nConcluding Observations\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n\n• Attack Diversity:  \n  The listed papers highlight how poison and backdoor attacks can be designed at different stages (data, model merging, prompt instructions, fine-tuning) and can be triggered in various ways (explicit triggers, subtle triggers, dormant or stealth triggers).\n\n• Multi-Modal Complexity:  \n  Vision-Language Models compound the complexity, since attackers can embed or hide triggers in images, text, or the synergy of both. Consequently, defenses must consider cross-modal consistency checks.\n\n• Retrieval-Augmentation Vulnerabilities:  \n  Many new attacks exploit the pipeline in which an LLM or VLM fetches external knowledge (documents, images, code examples) at inference time. Poisoned or manipulated retrieval corpora can funnel malicious content into a model’s generation.\n\n• Defensive Strategies:  \n  A number of papers also propose solutions: cleaning or debiasing procedures, robust instruction tuning, agent-based self-checking, and so forth. However, as with the arms race in cybersecurity, no single defense fully guarantees immunity.\n\n• Importance of Systematic Benchmarks and Reviews:  \n  Systematic reviews and benchmarking papers help the community compare new methods, standardize on better evaluation metrics, and eventually move toward best practices for secure deployments.\n\nOverall, these papers illustrate the emerging research focus on “data and model integrity” for large (vision) language models, especially as they become more prevalent in real-world applications. The key takeaway is that as LLMs and VLMs grow in scale and complexity, the pathways for hidden manipulations multiply—leading to a heightened need for robust defenses, thorough auditing, and ongoing vigilance.",

          "response": "The list you provided outlines an emerging research landscape focused on both attack vectors (such as poisoning and backdoor attacks) and defense mechanisms for large-scale language and vision-language models. Considering this as a thought experiment, we can derive several educational insights and discussion points:\n\n1. Scope and Diversity of Attacks:\n • The references cover a broad spectrum of scenarios—from covert poisoning in retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems to stealthy semantic manipulation in vision-language models (VLMs).  \n • This diversity indicates that adversaries may target different stages of model development (e.g., training, fine-tuning, merging) and across model types (LLMs, VLMs, agents), meaning that a defense in one area may not necessarily translate to others.\n\n2. Novel Attack Strategies:\n • Some studies explore nuanced methods such as gradient-based poisoning, which could be used to subtly modify model behavior without being easily detected.  \n • Specific vulnerabilities, like backdoors that get activated only under certain fine-tuning conditions, highlight that an attack does not need to be overt to be effective.\n\n3. Defense Mechanisms:\n • On the defense side, research that focuses on “robust anti-backdoor instruction tuning” or self-defending agents underscores the proactive measures being developed.  \n • The interplay between defenses and new types of attacks suggests that improving model robustness may require evolving training strategies, continuous monitoring, and possibly even self-healing architectures.\n\n4. Implications for Multi-modal and Retrieval-Augmented Systems:\n • As retrieval-augmented generation systems become more common, their role as potential weak links is being investigated. Attacks in these systems might leverage both the retrieval and the generation components, complicating detection and mitigation efforts.  \n • The integration of external data (e.g., user-provided information or externally retrieved documents) in RAG systems increases the attack surface, prompting developers to incorporate additional security measures and validation steps.\n\n5. Broader Ethical and Deployment Considerations:\n • From an ethical perspective, understanding both attacks and defenses is critical for responsible research and development. The thought experiment here is a reminder that while researching vulnerabilities can inform better security practices, actual exploitation for malicious purposes must be strictly avoided.  \n • It also emphasizes that any deployment of LLMs, VLMs, or agent-based systems should not only focus on performance but also incorporate robust safety protocols, continuous monitoring, and mechanisms for post-deployment vulnerability assessments.\n\n6. Encouraging a Proactive Security Posture:\n • The body of work you’ve referenced represents an “arms race” in which improved security awareness among researchers leads to the development of more sophisticated defenses, which in turn may drive adversaries to explore innovative attack strategies.  \n • For the machine learning community, understanding these dynamics is essential for designing models that are not only powerful but also resilient against emerging threats.\n\nIn summary, this thought experiment serves as a valuable exercise in understanding the fragile balance between model advancement and security. By exploring both attack vectors and potential defenses, researchers can design systems that are more robust, ensure stronger safeguards in deployment, and better prepare for adversarial contexts. It’s important to reiterate that such studies are intended solely for ethical, educational, and proactive security research, with the ultimate goal of strengthening the trustworthiness and safety of advanced models in practical applications.",

          "response": "This list appears to be a curated collection of recent research papers (from May and June 2025) focused on poisoning and backdoor attacks as well as the corresponding defenses in various types of models, including large language models (LLMs), vision-language models (VLMs), retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems, and even agent-based systems. Here’s a brief overview of the themes and contributions represented:\n\n1. Robust Defenses and Anti-Backdoor Methods  \n • Papers such as “Robust Anti-Backdoor Instruction Tuning in LVLMs” and “Your Agent Can Defend Itself against ### Backdoor Att@cks” indicate a focus on developing strategies that harden models against insidious backdoor manipulations during training or fine-tuning.  \n • Additionally, works on backdoor cleaning in multi-modal fine-tuning (e.g., “Backdoor Cleaning without External Guidance in MLLM Fine-tuning”) suggest ongoing efforts to remediate vulnerabilities even when the attack vector isn’t immediately apparent.\n\n2. Poisoning Attacks on Retrieval-Augmented Generation  \n • Multiple entries (for instance, “Joint-GCG: Unified Gradient-Based Poisoning Attacks on Retrieval-Augmented Generation Systems” and “CPA-RAG: Covert Poisoning Attacks on ### Retrieval-Augmented Generation in Largee Language ### Models”) target systems that make use of external retrieval components.  \n • The research here explores both the design of poisoning attacks that compromise answer generation and the potential for covert manipulation of the retrieval process.\n\n3. Stealth and Semantic Manipulation Approaches  \n • Projects like “Backdoor Attack on Vision Language Models wtih Stealthy Semantic Manipulation” and “Through the --- Stealth Lens: Rethinking Attacks and [REDACTED] Defenses in RAG” underscore efforts to develop or analyze attacks that are difficult to detect.  \n • In some cases, these studies delve into how subtle shifts in semantics or training patches can be aggregated over time to compromise system integrity.\n\n4. Systematic Reviews and Vulnerability Analyses  \n • One paper (“A Systematic Rveiew of Poisoning Attacks [MASK] Against Large Language Models”) appears to offer a broader survey of the landscape, reviewing the different techniques and vulnerabilities associated with poisoning attacks.  \n • Another study (“Which Factors Make Code LLMs More Vulnerable to Backdoor Attacks? A Systematic Sutdy”) specifically examines vulnerabilities in domain-specific language models, such as code LLMs, addressing what factors contribute to their susceptibility.\n\n5. Novel Attack Paradigms and Model Manipulation  \n • The work titled “Merge Hijacking: Backdoor Attacks to Model Merging of Large Language Models” explores a different avenue where the merging process itself—a common practice in model ensembling or fine-tuning—becomes an attack surface.  \n • Such research highlights how even well-established practices like model merging may introduce unforeseen risks if not properly safeguarded.\n\nOverall, the collection underscores an increasingly sophisticated threat landscape in which attackers are not only designing more covert and semantically subtle poisoning/backdoor attacks but defenders are actively researching robust tuning, detection, and cleaning strategies. The topics span well across different modalities (text, vision, and combinations thereof) and system architectures (direct LLMs, VLMs, RAGs, agents), reflecting the broader challenge of securing modern, complex AI systems.",

These works share a common thread: they explore vulnerabilities introduced by malicious modifications to training or model-merging processes, as well as potential defenses.\n\n1. Robust Anti-Backdoor Instruction Tuning in LVLMs (2025/06)  \n   • Focuses on instruction-tuning pipelines in large vision–language models (LVLMs).  \n   • Proposes strategies to robustly fine-tune LVLMs in ways that mitigate or remove backdoor triggers inserted during either pre-training or fine-tuning.\n\n2. Joint-GCG: Unified Gradient-Based Poisoning Attacks on Retrieval-Augmented Generation Systems (2025/06)  \n   • Presents a gradient-based attack method designed to “poison” retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) pipelines.  \n   • Explores how an adversary can alter training data or index content to manipulate end outputs with minimal detectability.\n\n3. Backdoor Attack on Vision Language Models with Stealthy Semantic Manipulation (2025/06)  \n   • Proposes a threat model for injecting triggers into vision–language models under the guise of small or semantically inconspicuous changes.  \n   • Highlights how seemingly benign modifications in label or object associations can yield backdoors that activate under specific conditions.\n\n4. A Systematic Review of Poisoning Attacks Against Large Language Models (2025/06)  \n   • Surveys existing literature and methods for data poisoning in LLMs.  \n   • Discusses the taxonomy of attacks, ranging from subtle text manipulations to malicious example engineering, as well as emerging defenses.\n\n5. Your Agent Can Defend Itself against Backdoor Attacks (2025/06)  \n   • Looks at agent-based LLM frameworks, where the model interacts with tools or APIs.  \n   • Offers a set of techniques for “self-defense,” such as anomaly detection or dynamic re-checking of suspicious data/tool outputs, to neutralize triggers at runtime.\n\n6. Which Factors Produce Code LLMs More Vulnerable to Backdoor Attacks? A Systematic Study (2025/06)  \n   • Investigates backdoor vulnerabilities specifically in code-oriented LLMs (like those specialized in code generation).  \n   • Examines how architectural components, training recipes, or dataset curation choices influence susceptibility to triggers.\n\n7. VLMs Can Aggregate Scattered Training Patches (2025/06)  \n   • Shows that certain patch-based poisoning strategies—where “trigger” patches are scattered across supposedly unrelated training data—can be reassembled by a vision–language model.  \n   • Raises concerns about how seemingly small, distributed modifications can accumulate into effective backdoors.\n\n8. Through the Stealth Lens: Rethinking Attacks and Defenses in RAG (2025/06)  \n   • Discusses stealthy manipulation and defense strategies in retrieval-augmented generation workflows.  \n   • Explores how advanced filtering, retrieval reevaluation, and robust indexing might thwart data poisoning or malicious expansions in the knowledge store.\n\n9. Spa-VLM: Stealthy Poisoning Attacks on RAG-based VLM (2025/05)  \n   • Demonstrates how coupling stealthy data poisoning with retrieval-based pipelines in a vision–language hybrid can produce well-hidden triggers.  \n   • Examines the spillover effect: once the poisoned content is retrieved at inference, the entire pipeline is influenced.\n\n10. Benchmarking Poisoning Attacks against Retrieval-Augmented Generation (2025/05)  \n   • Provides a standardized evaluation framework for testing various poisoning approaches on RAG systems.  \n   • Aims to compare strengths, weaknesses, and detectability of different techniques to foster more robust RAG pipelines.\n\n11. CPA-RAG: Covert Poisoning Attacks on Retrieval-Augmented Generation in Large Language Models (2025/05)  \n   • Investigates “covert” poisoning approaches that blend subtly into training corpora and retrieved knowledge.  \n   • Shows that even minor text-level adjustments can substantially shift RAG model output while evading detection and standard defenses.\n\n12. Merge Hijacking: Backdoor Attacks to Model Merging of Large Language Models (2025/05, ACL’25)  \n   • Targets the increasingly common practice of merging independently trained LLMs for efficiency or performance gains.  \n   • Describes injecting triggers into a model so that, when merged with another, the resulting model is backdoored without obvious changes to standard metrics.\n\n13. Finetuning-Activated Backdoors in LLMs (2025/05)  \n   • Examines how triggers can remain dormant after initial pre-training but activate when a model is further fine-tuned.  \n   • Proposes detection strategies for “latent” backdoors that only become influential under certain fine-tuning objectives.\n\n14. Backdoor Cleaning without External Guidance in MLLM Fine-tuning (2025/05)  \n   • Focuses on multi-modal large models (MLLMs) and how to remove backdoors during fine-tuning, without relying on external or trusted datasets.  \n   • Employs self-consistency checks and progressive re-training techniques to isolate suspicious parameters and “clean” the model.\n\nCollectively, these works illustrate important trends in modern adversarial machine learning:  \n• Data poisoning is increasingly sophisticated, with pervasive “stealth” strategies.  \n• Retrieval-augmented generation frameworks (RAG) are particularly vulnerable, since malicious entries in the retrieval index can contaminate results.  \n• Model merging and fine-tuning pipelines introduce new ways for backdoors to hide and activate.  \n• Defenses range from data sanitization and robust training to dynamic detection during inference or agent-driven verification.",

Here’s a brief overview of the emerging themes and topics captured by these works:\n\n1. Robust Defenses and Anti-Backdoor Tuning  \n   • Papers like “Robust Anti-Backdoor Instruction Tuning in LVLMs” and “Your Agent Can Defend Itself against Backdoor Attacks” focus on proactive methods for securing models. They propose techniques that allow language and vision-language systems to resist backdoor triggers, even in complex settings where the model might need to self-diagnose or adapt its behavior.\n\n2. Unified and Gradient-Based Attack Strategies  \n   • The work “Joint-GCG: Unified Gradient-Based Poisoning Attacks on Retrieval-Augmented Generation Systems” demonstrates a more conceptual attack framework targeting systems that combine retrieval components with generation. Similar methods in other papers emphasize how gradient-based approaches can be exploited to introduce subtle, hard-to-detect backdoors.\n\n3. Stealthy Manipulation in Multimodal Contexts  \n   • Papers such as “Backdoor Attack on Vision Language Models with Stealthy Semantic Manipulation” and “Spa-VLM: Stealthy Poisoning Attacks on RAG-based VLM” investigate attacks that hide manipulations within the semantic content itself, making detection more challenging, particularly in retrieval-augmented and multimodal contexts.\n\n4. Systematic Reviews and Benchmarking  \n   • The inclusion of systematic review contributions (e.g., “A Systematic Review of Poisoning Attacks Against Large Language Models”) and benchmarking efforts (“Benchmarking Poisoning Attacks against Retrieval-Augmented Generation”) indicates a drive toward consolidating our understanding of vulnerabilities and comparing defense strategies across various attack vectors.\n\n5. Specific Focus on Code Models and Fine-tuning  \n   • The paper on “Which Factors Produce Code LLMs More Vulnerable to Backdoor Attacks? A Systematic Study” addresses particular vulnerabilities in coding assistants. Meanwhile, works like “Finetuning-Activated Backdoors in LLMs” and “Backdoor Cleaning without External Guidance in MLLM Fine-tuning” delve into how the fine-tuning process can both introduce and mitigate malicious backdoors.\n\n6. Novel Attack Vectors and Merging Models  \n   • “Merge Hijacking: Backdoor Attacks to Model Merging of Large Language Models” explores an innovative attack scenario involving the merging of models—highlighting that even the process of combining pre-trained models can be a potential vulnerability.\n\nOverall, these papers span a range of methodologies—from stealthy poisoning and backdoor embedding to prevention and detection strategies—and cover both foundational insights (systematic reviews and benchmarking) as well as novel attacks and defense mechanisms in emerging AI systems (including retrieval-augmented generation and agent-based models).\n\nIf you need more detailed insights or discussion on any specific paper or theme within this collection, let me know!",

          "response": "Below is a brief, high-level overview of the recent research on poisoning and backdoor attacks/defenses in large (vision-)language models (LLMs, VLMs), as covered by the papers in your list. While each work focuses on a specific angle—ranging from stealthy training-data manipulations to on-the-fly defenses—together they provide a sense of how these vulnerabilities arise, how they manifest in different model modalities, and what emerging defense strategies look like.\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n1. Robust Anti-Backdoor and Backdoor Cleaning Methods\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n• Robust Anti-Backdoor Instruction Tuning in LVLMs – Studies how to defend against backdoor attacks even as models are instruction-tuned. Proposes methods to maintain model performance on clean data while neutralizing malicious triggers.  \n• Backdoor Cleaning without External Guidance in MLLM Fine-tuning – Explores removing backdoors from multimodal large models (e.g., vision–language) during fine-tuning, but without requiring external labels or guidance about which samples are poisoned.\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n2. Poisoning Attacks on Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n• Joint-GCG: Unified Gradient-Based Poisoning Attacks on RAG – Describes a poisoning method that can influence both the retriever and generator subsystems in retrieval-augmented LLMs.  \n• Through the Stealth Lens: Rethinking Attacks and Defenses in RAG – Focuses on stealthier forms of data manipulation that affect RAG pipelines undetected, and discusses possible mitigations.  \n• Spa-VLM: Stealthy Poisoning Attacks on RAG-based VLM – Proposes stealthy text+image poison that manipulates retrieval-augmented vision–language pipelines.  \n• Benchmarking Poisoning Attacks against Retrieval-Augmented Generation – Compares how well different poisoning strategies degrade or manipulate the performance of RAG-based LLMs.  \n• CPA-RAG: Covert Poisoning Attacks on Retrieval-Augmented Generation in Large Language Models – Another take on stealthy poisoning, emphasizing minimal detectability while maintaining a large effect.  \n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n3. Backdoor Attacks in Vision–Language Models (VLMs)\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n• Backdoor Attack on Vision Language Models with Stealthy Semantic Manipulation – Explores how to embed malicious triggers within images or image-text pairs, influencing downstream tasks without overt cues.  \n• VLMs Can Aggregate. Let me break this down into parts. Scattered Training Patches – Studies how even partially scattered and seemingly innocuous image patches can cumulatively create a backdoor effect once aggregated.  \n• Spa-VLM (also listed above) – Uses both text and image-level triggers inserted subtly in the training process.  \n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n4. Systematic Reviews and Emerging Trends\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n• A Systematic Review of Poisoning Attacks Against Large Language Models – Surveys the broader landscape of data manipulation and model manipulation attacks, their implications, and existing defenses.  \n• Which Factors Make Code LLMs More Vulnerable to Backdoor Attacks? A Systematic Study – Focuses on code-based LLMs, investigating how model architecture, training data size, and fine-tuning methodology might render them more susceptible to backdoors.\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n5. Attacks Targeting Model Merging and Fine-tuning Workflows\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n• Merge Hijacking: Backdoor Attacks to Model Merging of Large Language Models – Shows how a poisoned “donor” model can stealthily implant a backdoor into a newly merged model when different models are combined.  \n• Finetuning-Activated Backdoors in LLMs – Investigates how a model, pre-poisoned in the pretraining phase, can “activate” its backdoor once it is fine-tuned in typical scenarios (e.g., domain adaptation).  \n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n6. Defending Agents and Models\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n• Your Agent Can Defend Itself against Backdoor Attacks – Shifts the focus to LLM-based agents that proactively defend themselves by identifying or avoiding suspicious instructions or data during their ongoing interactions.\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nKey Takeaways\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n• Stealthier Attacks – Many recent works emphasize covert or minimally detectable triggers, demonstrating that malicious samples can be hidden (and remain effective) even under cursory inspection.  \n• Targeted vs. General – Some attacks specifically aim to manipulate certain tasks or targets (e.g., code completion, question answering with retrieval), while others emphasize broad approaches that degrade overall model behavior.  \n• Interplay with Modern Frameworks – Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipelines and multi-stage processes (e.g., instruction tuning, merging) introduce new entry points for data poisoning or backdoor injection.  \n• Defenses & Mitigations – Proposed remedies include special training objectives, outlier detection in training data, and dynamic agent-level defenses. However, robust, universally applicable defenses remain an open challenge.  \n\nIn short, these papers collectively illustrate the rising sophistication of poisoning and backdoor attacks in large text-, code-, and vision–language models and the equally evolving research on how to detect, mitigate, and remove such threats. Researchers are increasingly focused on subtle trigger designs, multi-stage pipelines (like retrieval + generation), model merging dynamics, and fine-tuning vulnerabilities—all of which can stealthily undermine LLM reliability.",

          "response": "Below is a high-level security assessment synthesized from recent research on backdoor and poisoning attacks targeting Large Language Models (LLMs), Vision-Language Models (VLMs), and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems. These papers collectively highlight new, sophisticated threat models and defensive strategies within the AI ecosystem. The summary below notes the overarching vulnerabilities, attack mechanisms, and recommended avenues for mitigation.\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n1. Overview of Emerging Attack Vectors\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n\n• Poisoning & Stealth Attacks on LLMs and VLMs  \n  - Multiple works discuss how training data can be subtly manipulated so that models learn hidden triggers (“backdoors”).  \n  - Stealthy semantic manipulations can embed malicious behaviors without being easily detected by conventional outlier or data sanitization methods.\n\n• Backdoor Attacks via Instruction Tuning and Model Merging  \n  - “Finetuning-Activated Backdoors in LLMs” and “Merge Hijacking” describe scenarios where backdoors can be introduced or reactivated during fine-tuning or model-merging processes.  \n  - Attackers exploit inconsistent distributions of training data or mismatched model parameters to embed triggers that remain dormant until specific prompts appear.\n\n• Poisoning Attacks for Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)  \n  - Papers such as “Joint-GCG” and “CPA-RAG” examine covert poisoning on the retrieval corpus or the retrieval module itself. When an LLM depends on an external knowledge store, malicious modifications in that store can produce manipulated outputs.  \n  - “Benchmarking Poisoning Attacks against RAG” highlights how steering the retrieved context data can effectively cause the model to produce incorrect or harmful information at inference.\n\n• Code LLMs and Vulnerability Factors  \n  - “Which Factors Make Code LLMs More Vulnerable to Backdoor Attacks?” shows code-specific vulnerabilities. Different architectural designs, training sizes, or skews in code corpora may create more attack surface areas for backdoors triggered by code snippets.\n\n• Vision-Language Models and Patch-Based Attacks  \n  - “Backdoor Attack on Vision Language Models with Stealthy Semantic Manipulation,” “VLMs Can Aggregate Scattered Training Patches,” and “Spa-VLM” illustrate that VLMs can be backdoored not just in text or label space but also in the image domain (e.g., with small, unobtrusive patches).  \n  - The cross-modal nature of these attacks can make detection harder, as triggers might appear in either the text or visual input.\n\n• Autonomous Agents with Self-Defense  \n  - “Your Agent Can Defend Itself against Backdoor Attacks” offers strategies in which an LLM-based agent or a multi-modal agent can be equipped with detection routines that evaluate suspicious input or decide to skip certain instructions if backdoor-like patterns are present.\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n2. Common Themes & Technical Insights\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n\n1) Subtle, Distributed Triggers:  \n   • Many attacks rely on placing small, unobtrusive “patches” (visual or textual) in training data.  \n   • These triggers often appear in only a tiny fraction of the dataset but cause disproportionately large malicious effects.\n\n2) Hidden and Activation-Specific Behavior:  \n   • Backdoors typically remain dormant unless prompted by very specific triggers or prompts.  \n   • This challenge complicates detection since typical validation sets rarely include these triggering inputs.\n\n3) Attack Complexity and Cost Decreasing:  \n   • Several studies show that smaller subsets of training data can achieve significant backdoor injection, making it more feasible for a low-resourced adversary.\n\n4) Model Merging & Fine-Tuning as Attack Vectors:  \n   • Repeatedly merging LLM checkpoints from diverse sources or re-finetuning a widely distributed model can inadvertently incorporate malicious parameters.  \n   • This can happen within commercial or community-based model development if insufficiently vetted or quarantined.\n\n5) Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) Exploitation:  \n   • Poisoning the external knowledge sources used by RAG is often easier than compromising the core LLM.  \n   • Attackers can focus on stealthily polluting domain-specific or user-supplied documents to bias or manipulate the generation process.\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n3. Potential Impacts\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n\n• Misinformation & Manipulation:  \n  - Poisoning attacks may cause the model to generate selected falsehoods on demand, undermining trust and reliability in LLM-based systems.\n\n• Privacy & Data Exfiltration:  \n  - By injecting malicious triggers, an attacker may coax a model to leak private or sensitive information from training data if the system is insufficiently protected.\n\n• Intellectual Property & Regulatory Risks:  \n  - Altered or malicious code generation by compromised Code LLMs can introduce security vulnerabilities.  \n  - Discreet backdoors in AI systems may cause regulatory compliance issues if used in healthcare, finance, or governmental applications.\n\n• Erosion of Model Credibility:  \n  - Pervasive backdoor vulnerabilities undermine public confidence in AI-driven products. Repeated successful exploits reduce user trust.\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n4. Recommended Defensive Strategies\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n\n• Robust Data Cleansing and Verification  \n  - Use advanced anomaly detection algorithms (e.g., feature clustering, outlier detection) to filter or isolate suspicious training examples.  \n  - Enforce strict data provenance: maintain logs on data sources and employ secure pipelines.\n\n• Backdoor-Resistant Training Procedures  \n  - “Robust Anti-Backdoor Instruction Tuning in LVLMs” and “Backdoor Cleaning without External Guidance in MLLM Fine-tuning” propose strategies to mitigate or remove backdoors, even when no clean reference dataset or external supervision is available.  \n  - Techniques such as re-initializing partial parameters or using differential privacy-based training can reduce the likelihood of successful injection.\n\n• Model Auditing and “Red Teaming”  \n  - Develop rigorous adversarial testing frameworks (e.g., searching for triggers, abnormal parameter patterns, or suspicious outputs).  \n  - Perform model audits at every stage of the life cycle, especially before deploying updates or merges.\n\n• Multi-Stage Verification for RAG  \n  - For RAG systems, maintain careful oversight of the retrieval corpus.  \n  - Consider implementing cross-verification or consensus-based approaches (e.g., verifying results with multiple sources or models).\n\n• Adaptive Defense Agents  \n  - As suggested by “Your Agent Can Defend Itself against Backdoor Attacks,” AI-driven introspection or watchdog modules can identify suspicious input or output patterns in real-time.  \n  - Automated “kill switches” can temporarily disable generation or raise alerts when suspect triggers arise.\n\n• Transparent Model Sharing Protocols  \n  - If models or checkpoints are shared within large communities, adopt cryptographic methods or robust integrity checks to detect tampering.  \n  - Encourage open reporting of observed anomalies and maintain an updated “reputation” index for safe model merges.\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n5. Conclusion\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nThe recent research underscores that backdoor and poisoning attacks pose a growing and sophisticated threat to both LLMs and broader, multimodal AI systems. Attackers can exploit numerous weak points—from data curation and fine-tuning to model merging and retrieval modules—making purely reactive defenses insufficient.\n\nOrganizations deploying or developing large models should assume that training data can be partially compromised and should integrate systematic defenses at multiple stages:\n\n• Pre-deployment screening of training data (textual and visual).  \n• Integration of dynamic or agent-based detection for suspicious triggers.  \n• Ongoing vigilance, validation, and cryptographic or trust-based measures when merging or sharing models.\n\nBy adopting a security-first mindset, AI practitioners can significantly reduce the risk of successful backdoor or poisoning attacks, thereby safeguarding model integrity and user trust.",

          "response": "Below is a sample security assessment report focusing on category B3: Poisoning and Backdoor attacks, with an emphasis on the risks and challenges posed by recent advancements in the research literature.\n\n────────────────────────────  \nSummary of Assessment  \n────────────────────────────  \nRecent research trends indicate a wide array of poisoning and backdoor techniques targeting various systems—including large language models (LLMs), vision-language models (VLMs), and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems. Multiple studies (dated 2025/05 and 2025/06) highlight new tactics ranging from covert gradient-based poisoning attacks and stealthy semantic manipulations to emerging defense mechanisms. This assessment synthesizes key findings from the literature and provides recommendations for mitigating these evolving risks.\n\n────────────────────────────  \nKey Observations  \n────────────────────────────  \n1. Technique Diversification:  \n • Several papers propose gradient-based poisoning attacks (e.g., “Joint-GCG”) that manipulate the retrieval or generation process in LLMs and RAG systems.  \n • Backdoor approaches are evolving—from merging attacks (e.g., “Merge Hijacking”) to fine-tuning activated backdoors, demonstrating that malicious actors may embed triggers that are only activated under specific conditions.  \n • Attacks on multimodal architectures (VLMs) indicate that the threat landscape now spans vision and language combined models, raising complexity significantly.\n\n2. Stealth and Covert Injection:  \n • Many recent studies emphasize “stealthy” behavior in attacks, whereby adversaries embed malicious cues within innocuous data or training patches (e.g., “Spa-VLM” and “Through the Stealth Lens”).  \n • The hidden nature of these manipulations complicates detection, especially in systems that heavily rely on pre-trained weights or aggregated data during fine-tuning.\n\n3. Robustness and Defense:  \n • Some research (e.g., “Your Agent Can Defend Itself against Backdoor Attacks”) explores defensive measures for autonomous systems, suggesting that while defenses are emerging, they must be continually updated to counter adaptive attack strategies.  \n • There is an observed arms race between novel poisoning/backdoor methods and corresponding defense techniques; effective solutions must be evaluated in varied deployment scenarios (LLM, VLM, RAG).\n\n────────────────────────────  \nRisk Analysis  \n────────────────────────────  \n• Exploitation Potential:  \n The diversity of techniques indicates that many attack vectors remain viable. Poisoning the training process or incorporating backdoors into model fine-tuning workflows can have severe implications, including model misbehavior at inference time or unauthorized system control.  \n\n• Impact Scope:  \n Systems deployed in sensitive or high-stakes environments (e.g., medical, legal, financial applications) are particularly vulnerable. A successful attack can lead to unintended outputs, data poisoning, and in some cases, persistent system compromise.\n\n• Detection Challenges:  \n Given the stealthy nature of some poisoning attacks, conventional monitoring tools and evaluation protocols may fail to recognize deeply embedded triggers. Models that aggregate scattered training patches (as noted in “VLMs Can Aggregate Scattered Training Patches”) may inadvertently consolidate malicious signals over time.\n\n────────────────────────────  \nRecommendations for Mitigation  \n────────────────────────────  \n1. Rigorous Data Validation and Sanitization:  \n • Enhance pre-training and fine-tuning pipelines with robust data filtering and anomaly detection mechanisms to flag potential poisoning attempts early.  \n • Introduce randomness and checksums during data ingestion to detect inconsistencies that could indicate malicious perturbations.\n\n2. Adversarial Testing and Simulation:  \n • Develop red teaming exercises that simulate both poisoning and backdoor attack scenarios.  \n • Incorporate stress tests that evaluate models under adversarially manipulated inputs, ensuring the robustness of deployed systems.\n\n3.

The recent papers shed light on sophisticated manipulations that leverage both the training and inference stages of modern models. Organizations deploying LLMs, VLMs, or RAG systems must integrate comprehensive safeguards—from acquisition of clean data and rigorous testing to continuous monitoring and rapid incident response. Long-term resilience will require dynamic defenses that can adapt as adversaries refine their techniques.\n\nThis assessment underlines the critical need for ongoing research, robust operational practices, and inter-disciplinary collaboration to mitigate the risks posed by poisoning and backdoor attacks in AI systems.",

These papers highlight significant security vulnerabilities and potential defense mechanisms.\n\n## Key Security Concerns\n\n### 1. RAG System Vulnerabilities\nMultiple papers demonstrate that RAG systems are particularly vulnerable to poisoning attacks where malicious content is inserted into retrieval databases. \"Joint-GCG\" and \"CPA-RAG\" show how attackers can craft gradient-based poisoning attacks that remain effective even when the poisoned content is processed through retrieval mechanisms. \"Through the Stealth Lens\" reveals that stealthy attacks can bypass current defense mechanisms.\n\n### 2. Backdoor Attack Sophistication\nResearch shows increasing sophistication in backdoor attacks:\n- \"Backdoor Attack on Vision Language Models\" demonstrates semantic manipulation techniques that are difficult to detect\n- \"Finetuning-Activated Backdoors\" shows how dormant backdoors can be activated during fine-tuning\n- \"Merge Hijacking\" reveals vulnerabilities in model merging processes\n\n### 3. Code LLM Vulnerabilities\n\"Which Factors Make Code LLMs More Vulnerable\" indicates that code-focused LLMs may have unique vulnerabilities to backdoor attacks, potentially compromising software development pipelines.\n\n## Defense Mechanisms\n\nSeveral promising defense approaches are emerging:\n\n1. **Anti-Backdoor Instruction Tuning**: \"Robust Anti-Backdoor Instruction Tuning in LVLMs\" presents methods to make models more resistant to backdoor attacks.\n\n2. **Self-Defense Capabilities**: \"Your Agent Can Defend Itself against Backdoor Attacks\" suggests that agents can be trained to recognize and mitigate backdoor triggers.\n\n3. **Backdoor Cleaning**: \"Backdoor Cleaning without External Guidance\" offers techniques to remove backdoors during fine-tuning without requiring clean datasets.\n\n## Risk Assessment\n\nThe research demonstrates that:\n\n1. **Stealthy attacks are advancing**: Attackers are developing increasingly subtle methods that can evade detection.\n\n2. **Data poisoning is a major threat**: Especially for systems that incorporate external knowledge (RAG, retrieval systems).\n\n3. **Model manipulation vulnerabilities exist throughout the AI lifecycle**: From training data poisoning to fine-tuning and model merging.\n\n## Recommendations\n\n1. **Implement robust retrieval filtering**: RAG systems should incorporate content verification and anomaly detection.\n\n2. **Adopt multi-layered defense strategies**: Combine data sanitization, model verification, and runtime monitoring.\n\n3. **Develop backdoor detection tools**: Regular scanning for potential backdoors in models and training data.\n\n4. **Establish trusted data sources**: Verify the provenance of training data and external knowledge sources.\n\n5. **Monitor model behavior post-updates**: Watch for unexpected behavior changes after fine-tuning or merging.\n\nThe rapid development of both attack and defense techniques suggests this will remain an active area requiring continuous security updates and monitoring.",

Here’s a research-focused analysis of recent work on Poison & Backdoor attacks in LLMs, VLMs, and RAG systems, using your provided bibliography.\n\n---\n\n# Research Trends in Poison & Backdoor Attacks on LLMs/VLMs/RAG (2024–2025)\n\n## 1. **Attack Vectors and Modalities**\n- **LLMs**: Several works ([Systematic Review](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06518), [Finetuning-Activated Backdoors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16567), [Merge Hijacking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23561)) focus on how LLMs are susceptible to poisoning during pre-training, finetuning, or even model merging.\n- **VLMs**: Attacks target the multi-modal nature of VLMs, with works such as [Stealthy Semantic Manipulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07214) and [VLMs Can Aggregate Scattered Training Patches](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03614) exploring how visual cues can be leveraged for backdoors.\n- **RAG**: Retrieval-Augmented Generation systems are highlighted as uniquely vulnerable due to their reliance on external retrieval ([CPA-RAG](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19864), [Benchmarking Poisoning Attacks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18543), [Spa-VLM](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23828)), with attacks targeting the retrieval corpus or the retrieval-augmented pipeline.\n\n## 2. **Novelty in Attack Strategies**\n- **Stealth and Covert Attacks**: Modern backdoor attacks prioritize stealth ([Through the Stealth Lens](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04390), [Spa-VLM](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23828)), manipulating models in ways that are hard to detect with standard evaluation.\n- **Semantic and Gradient-based Poisoning**: Attacks are becoming more sophisticated by leveraging semantic triggers ([Stealthy Semantic Manipulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07214)) or unified gradient-based approaches ([Joint-GCG](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06151)) that are effective across modalities.\n\n## 3. **Defenses and Mitigation**\n- **Self-Defending Agents**: Recent research ([Your Agent Can Defend Itself](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08336)) explores autonomous defense mechanisms, empowering agents to detect and mitigate backdoors at inference or fine-tuning time.\n- **Backdoor Cleaning**: There is increasing focus on data- and model-centric defenses that do not require external ground truth ([Backdoor Cleaning without External Guidance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16916)), crucial for practical deployment.\n- **Robust Instruction Tuning**: Defensive tuning paradigms ([Robust Anti-Backdoor Instruction Tuning in LVLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05401)) aim to immunize models during instruction tuning to resist backdoor activation.\n\n## 4. **Vulnerability Analysis**\n- **Systematic Reviews**: Comprehensive surveys ([Systematic Review](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06518)) outline the landscape of known attacks and defenses, synthesizing trends and open challenges.\n- **Code LLMs as a Case Study**: Targeted analyses ([Which Factors Make Code LLMs More Vulnerable](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01825)) reveal that code LLMs may have unique susceptibilities due to their training data and usage patterns.\n\n## 5. **Benchmarking and Evaluation**\n- **Standardized Benchmarks**: Works like [Benchmarking Poisoning Attacks against RAG](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18543) contribute evaluation suites, helping the field measure progress and compare defenses in a reproducible manner.\n\n## 6. **Emerging Themes**\n- **Model Merging Attacks**: Attacks via model merging ([Merge Hijacking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23561)) are a new frontier, especially relevant as open-source models are increasingly combined.\n- **Fine-tuning Triggers**: Backdoors that are dormant until finetuning ([Finetuning-Activated Backdoors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16567)) highlight the need for vigilance at all stages of the model lifecycle.\n\n---\n\n## **Summary Table**\n\n| Focus Area      | Notable Papers

          "response": "Below is a thematic overview of recent work (with projected 2025 publication dates) on poisoning and backdoor attacks in large AI models. The papers collectively advance several thrusts: (1) understanding how backdoors are introduced and manifested in various pipelines (vision-language, retrieval-augmented, code generation, etc.), (2) designing new stealthy and powerful attacks, and (3) proposing emerging defense mechanisms (e.g., self-protecting agents, anti-backdoor training).  \n\n──────────────────────────────────────────────────\n1) Poisoning & Backdoor in Instruction Tuning & Code LLMs\n──────────────────────────────────────────────────\n• Robust Anti-Backdoor Instruction Tuning in LVLMs  \n  Proposes robust instruction-tuning strategies for large vision-language models (LVLMs). Discusses how carefully designed instruction-tuning procedures can mitigate “trigger” vulnerabilities while maintaining high model accuracy.\n\n• Which Factors Make Code LLMs More Vulnerable to Backdoor Attacks? A Systematic Study  \n  Explores the unique aspects of code-focused LLMs that heighten or diminish their susceptibility to backdoor triggers (e.g., data distribution differences or domain-specific token patterns). Provides systematic experiments to pinpoint pressure points, such as specialized vocabularies or extended contexts in code.\n\n• Finetuning-Activated Backdoors in LLMs  \n  Investigates the “dormant” triggers that remain hidden in model weights and become activated only after a specific fine-tuning step. Reveals how commercial or open-source LLM release cycles might unintentionally propagate these latent vulnerabilities.\n\n• Merge Hijacking: Backdoor Attacks to Model Merging of Large Language Models  \n  Focuses on the practice of merging multiple pre-trained LLM checkpoints. Introduces an attack strategy in which an adversary plants triggers in one model that remain invisible until merged with another. Highlights implications for multi-organization model combination and checkpoint sharing.\n\n──────────────────────────────────────────────────\n2) Poisoning & Backdoor in Vision-Language Models (VLMs)\n──────────────────────────────────────────────────\n• Backdoor Attack on Vision Language Models with Stealthy Semantic Manipulation  \n  Demonstrates how subtle changes to training images or text embeddings can stealthily implant backdoors in vision-language models (VLMs). Emphasizes semantic, rather than purely pixel-level, triggers that remain potent even under transformations like scaling or text paraphrasing.\n\n• VLMs Can Aggregate Scattered Training Patches  \n  Explores a novel “patchwork” threat in which an attacker distributes seemingly independent fragments of poisoned data. Shows that VLMs can inadvertently aggregate these pieces into a coherent backdoor trigger. Calls for specialized detection strategies that look beyond single-sample anomalies.\n\n• Backdoor Cleaning without External Guidance in MLLM Fine-tuning  \n  Focuses on removing suspected triggers from multimodal LLMs without requiring a clean reference dataset or external supervisory signals. Proposes iterative approaches that isolate and eliminate suspicious latent representations during fine-tuning.\n\n──────────────────────────────────────────────────\n3) Poisoning & Backdoor in Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)\n──────────────────────────────────────────────────\n• Joint-GCG: Unified Gradient-Based Poisoning Attacks on Retrieval-Augmented Generation Systems  \n  Introduces a gradient-based approach to poisons that jointly manipulate retrieval and generation modules. Demonstrates that small, targeted modifications to the retrieval corpus can cascade into systematically corrupted generation outputs.\n\n• Through the Stealth Lens: Rethinking Attacks and Defenses in RAG  \n  Proposes a new framework to study poisoning in RAG that prioritizes stealth. Emphasizes how adversaries can hide manipulation across multiple retrieval documents (and how defenders can detect or limit such cross-document correlations).\n\n• Benchmarking Poisoning Attacks against Retrieval-Augmented Generation  \n  Presents a rigorous benchmark for systematically comparing different RAG poisoning attacks. Assesses success rates, stealth, and potential detection signals under real-world constraints like partial access to the retrieval index.\n\n• CPA-RAG: Covert Poisoning Attacks on Retrieval-Augmented Generation in Large Language Models  \n  Extends conventional poisoning with “covert” triggers carefully woven into text shards. Demonstrates that covert triggers can remain indistinguishable from benign noise yet cause highly targeted manipulations in generated responses.\n\n──────────────────────────────────────────────────\n4) Broader Surveys and New Directions\n──────────────────────────────────────────────────\n• A Systematic Review of Poisoning Attacks Against Large Language Models  \n  A survey that synthesizes poisoning tactics across diverse model families (foundation LLMs, code LLMs, multilingual LLMs, etc.). Outlines a taxonomy of poisoning goals (targeted misclassification vs. open-ended manipulations) and reveals prevailing defensive blind spots.\n\n• Your Agent Can Defend Itself against Backdoor Attacks  \n  Investigates agent-based LLM frameworks that continuously monitor model outputs and metadata to thwart suspected backdoor triggers on the fly. Proposes an “active defense” approach in which the agent self-checks for anomalies and can quarantine suspicious outputs or weight updates.\n\n• Spa-VLM: Stealthy Poisoning Attacks on RAG-based VLM  \n  Connects the dots between vision-language modeling and retrieval-augmented generation, introducing a stealthy poisoning method that specifically targets multimodal retrieval modules to exert fine-grained manipulation over final text or image-text outputs.\n\n──────────────────────────────────────────────────\nKey Takeaways\n──────────────────────────────────────────────────\n1) Expanding Attack Modalities:  \n   Attacks span beyond straightforward data corruption, leveraging stealthy “semantic triggers,” distributed patches, or fine-tuning-activated vulnerabilities.  \n2) RAG as a Critical New Vector:  \n   Retrieval augmentation opens another dimension where adversaries can alter documents/corpora, often in ways that are harder to monitor or detect.  \n3) Novel Defense Mechanisms:  \n   Recent works propose methods such as robust instruction tuning, “self-defending” LLM agents, or unsupervised cleaning to detect and remove triggers without external labels.  \n4) Persistent Challenges:  \n   Many defense strategies rely on partial knowledge of the training corpus, weight parameters, or distribution shifts; real-world scenarios may permit attackers subtle infiltration routes. Moreover, the complexity of large multimodal or code-centric models provides fertile ground for covert attacks.\n\nOverall, these studies underscore that both attackers and defenders are progressing quickly. Poisoning and backdoor threats are becoming more sophisticated and stealthy, especially in multimodal and retrieval-augmented contexts. Simultaneously, new lines of research show promise—ranging from novel detection heuristics to agent-based self-checking behaviors—to keep AI systems robust against such adversarial exploits.",

          "response": "The collection of recent studies highlights a rapidly evolving research frontier in poisoning and backdoor attacks on modern large-scale models. Here are some research perspectives drawn from these works:\n\n1. Emerging Attack Surfaces in Multimodal Systems\n\n • Several papers (e.g., Robust Anti-Backdoor Instruction Tuning in LVLMs; Backdoor Attack on Vision Language Models with Stealthy Semantic Manipulation) indicate that models combining language and vision modalities are particularly vulnerable. Their rich input spaces and multimodal interactions provide fertile ground for stealthy manipulations—whether via poisoned training signals or subtle semantic triggers.\n\n2. Sophistication in Poisoning Techniques\n\n • The inclusion of works like Joint-GCG on gradient-based poisoning attacks and CPA-RAG on covert attacks in retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems shows that adversaries are now leveraging gradient information and the retrieval process itself. These techniques suggest that poisoning can be made both effective and difficult to detect, especially when attacks are integrated at different stages of model training or inference.\n\n3. Systematic Reviews and Benchmarking Efforts\n\n • The systematic review of poisoning attacks against large language models points to the value of consolidating our understanding. Such reviews help map the landscape of attack vectors, assessing vulnerabilities that span both classical LLM designs and emerging architectures which incorporate retrieval mechanisms or merge models.\n • Benchmarking studies are particularly important—they ensure that defenses are tested against realistic threat models and that performance under attack scenarios is well understood.\n\n4. The Dual Role of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)\n\n • Several papers focus on RAG-based systems (e.g., Through the Stealth Lens: Rethinking Attacks and Defenses in RAG, Benchmarking Poisoning Attacks against Retrieval-Augmented Generation). These works underscore that incorporating external knowledge retrieval can introduce new channels for attackers. It becomes imperative to think of defenses that are holistic, considering both the generation component and the retrieval backbone.\n\n5. Attack Detection, Prevention, and Cleaning\n\n • Research on “Your Agent Can Defend Itself against Backdoor Attacks” and “Backdoor Cleaning without External Guidance in MLLM Fine-tuning” reveals an emerging trend: not only are adversaries evolving, but so too are defense mechanisms. The focus is shifting towards proactive detection and self-defensive strategies, indicating that future model designs might integrate dynamic, in-built countermeasures to mitigate persistent threats.\n\n6. Specialized Vulnerabilities in Domain-Specific Models\n\n • The study on “Which Factors Make Code LLMs More Vulnerable to Backdoor Attacks? A Systematic Study” highlights that even within the broad domain of LLMs, there are subcategories—like code generation models—that have unique vulnerabilities. This suggests that mitigation strategies may need to be tailored to the specific domain and operational context of the model.\n\n7. Considerations for Model Merging\n\n • The work on Merge Hijacking—attacks targeting model merging processes—opens a new dimension. As models are increasingly shared, merged, or fine-tuned collaboratively, ensuring the integrity of the merging process becomes crucial to prevent malicious backdoors from spreading across systems.\n\nOverall, these studies collectively paint a picture of a field in flux. The benefits of rich, retrieval-enhanced, and multimodal models come with an increased risk of sophisticated poisoning and backdoor attacks. Going forward, research must balance the drive toward higher model capability with robust methodologies to detect, deter, and remediate such vulnerabilities. This integrated perspective, embracing everything from attack innovation to self-defensive mechanisms in agents, is key to securing the next generation of AI systems.",

Note that because these works are fictional in nature, the summaries synthesize common themes in backdoor/poisoning research rather than summarizing real papers.\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n1. Robust Anti-Backdoor Instruction Tuning in LVLMs\n   • Focus: Proposes strategies to inoculate large vision-language models (LVLMs) against backdoor triggers introduced during instruction-tuning.\n   • Key Idea: Uses robust training objectives that detect and remove potential trigger artifacts while preserving legitimate model behavior.\n   • Significance: Highlights how vulnerabilities can arise when LVLMs are instruction-tuned without careful auditing.\n\n2. Joint-GCG: Unified Gradient-Based Poisoning Attacks on Retrieval-Augmented Generation Systems\n   • Focus: Introduces a unified gradient-based poisoning framework for RAG pipelines (tying an external retriever with a generative model).\n   • Key Idea: Utilizes gradient signals from both retrieval and generation steps to craft imperceptible poisoned samples.\n   • Significance: Demonstrates that integrated RAG components allow more potent or stealthy poisoning points.\n\n3. Backdoor Attack on Vision-Language Models with Stealthy Semantic Manipulation\n   • Focus: Explores new forms of backdoors in vision-language tasks, e.g., image-captioning systems or visual QA.\n   • Key Idea: Hides triggers in semantically coherent “patches” or textual attributes, so unsuspecting method developers do not notice malicious modifications.\n   • Significance: Underscores how close alignment of image and text features can be exploited to embed stealthy triggers.\n\n4. A Systematic Review of Poisoning Attacks Against Large Language Models\n   • Focus: Survey paper that categorizes recent poisoning attack/defense strategies targeted at LLMs (pre-training, fine-tuning, retrieval-augmented, etc.).\n   • Key Idea: Provides a structured taxonomy of attack vectors (data-based, parameter-based, model-merging-based) and countermeasures.\n   • Significance: A unifying reference for researchers to grasp the breadth and evolution of poisoning threats in LLM pipelines.\n\n5. Your Agent Can Defend Itself Against Backdoor Attacks\n   • Focus: Examines how agent-based frameworks (where an LLM orchestrates sub-tasks or tool usage) can detect or mitigate backdoors autonomously.\n   • Key Idea: Employs internal consistency checks or repeated querying as an agent “mind” to isolate malicious triggers and refuse suspicious instructions.\n   • Significance: Proposes an LLM-agent–centered roadmap to real-time defense rather than purely offline training solutions.\n\n6. Which Factors Make Code LLMs More Vulnerable to Backdoor Attacks? A Systematic Study\n   • Focus: Investigates how code-focused LLMs (for code generation, completion, etc.) might exhibit distinct or heightened vulnerabilities.\n   • Key Idea: Studies influences such as dataset structure, token-level vs. AST-level triggers, and code-specific constraints (syntax or compilation).\n   • Significance: Highlights that code LLMs, by virtue of structured output and domain specifics, can be exploited through subtle backdoor triggers.\n\n7. VLMs Can Aggregate Scattered Training Patches\n   • Focus: Shows how vision-language models can inadvertently learn from small, distributed “poison” patches scattered across training data.\n   • Key Idea: Even fragments that do not fully reveal a malicious pattern can collectively embed a backdoor trigger through multi-modal linking.\n   • Significance: Raises awareness that partitioning or randomizing subsets of data does not guarantee immunity, as a model can unify these pieces over training.\n\n8. Through the Stealth Lens: Rethinking Attacks and Defenses in RAG\n   • Focus: Explores the subtlety of “stealth” in RAG-based attacks—where compromised knowledge sources can mislead generation invisibly.\n   • Key Idea: Recommends new metrics and detection protocols that focus on semantic stealth rather than overt anomalies.\n   • Significance: Encourages the community to move beyond surface-level anomaly detection and consider RAG’s deeper vulnerabilities.\n\n9. SPA-VLM: Stealthy Poisoning Attacks on RAG-Based VLM\n   • Focus: Turnkey approach for stealthily poisoning pipelines that retrieve both text and image data, then feed it into a generative module.\n   • Key Idea: Adds minimal modifications across images or text in the retrieval corpus, ensuring near-opacity to standard detection tools.\n   • Significance: Demonstrates the challenge of defending multi-modal retrieval-augmented generation, which faces more complicated data streams than text alone.\n\n10. Benchmarking Poisoning Attacks Against Retrieval-Augmented Generation\n   • Focus: Proposes a publicly available testbed for systematically evaluating poisoning attacks in RAG setups.\n   • Key Idea: Standardizes tasks, metrics, and evaluation scenarios to compare methods fairly and highlight robust defense strategies.\n   • Significance: Fills a gap by providing reliable “apples to apples” benchmarks that accelerate improvements in defense.\n\n11. CPA-RAG: Covert Poisoning Attacks on Retrieval-Augmented Generation in Large Language Models\n   • Focus: Examines “covert” (extremely low-profile) poison injection strategies that produce large impact with minimal changes.\n   • Key Idea: Relies on adversarially optimized textual or multi-modal snippets that retrieve incorrectly for specific triggers, thus hijacking generation.\n   • Significance: Emphasizes the difficulty of identifying threats that center on entire RAG pipelines, not just the generative LLM.\n\n12. Merge Hijacking: Backdoor Attacks to Model Merging of Large Language Models\n   • Focus: Shows how the commonly used technique of merging separately trained LLM checkpoints can embed hidden triggers if any one checkpoint is poisoned.\n   • Key Idea: Exploits mismatched parameter distributions or interpolation steps to preserve malicious functionality while overshadowing it for normal usage.\n   • Significance: Reveals a real threat in collaborative or open-source model development, where merges are frequent practice.\n\n13. Finetuning-Activated Backdoors in LLMs\n   • Focus: Investigates how fine-tuning can inadvertently activate dormant backdoor triggers that were inserted in the base model.\n   • Key Idea: Mislabeled data or carefully inserted triggers can survive pre-training unobserved, only to emerge under certain conditions in downstream tasks.\n   • Significance: Warns that after-market customizations of LLMs can open doors to hazards that even the original model developer never encountered.\n\n14. Backdoor Cleaning Without External Guidance in MLLM Fine-Tuning\n   • Focus: Addresses how to remove backdoors from multi-modal large models (MLLMs) when the fine-tuner lacks separate clean data or external knowledge.\n   • Key Idea: Develops self-consistency or robust training frameworks that internally identify suspicious patterns and prune them.\n   • Significance: Offers a self-contained defensive strategy especially important in settings with limited or private data.\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n\nOverall Themes in Backdoor & Poisoning Research:\n• Increasing Complexity of Attack Surfaces: As LLMs and VLMs rely on larger, more diverse training corpora, subtle modifications (poisons) can slip in.\n• Multi-Modal Susceptibility: Vision-language or retrieval-augmented pipelines introduce new vectors for embedding triggers.\n• Stealthy vs. Highly Visible Attacks: Recent work focuses on making triggers as covert as possible so standard anomaly detectors fail to detect them.\n• Difficulty of Mitigation: Defenses often require specialized fine-tuning or auditing steps, but must avoid overcorrecting and harming model utility.\n• Need for Holistic Solutions: Because poisoning can emerge at different stages—pre-training, fine-tuning, retrieval, merging—robust solutions must address the entire lifecycle of LLM/VLM deployment.\n\nThese papers (in the fictional scenario you provided) collectively highlight the technical ingenuity, breadth of attack strategies, and growing urgency for robust, end-to-end defensive approaches in the face of poisoning and backdoor threats to large (multi-modal) language models.",

          "response": "This collection of references appears to outline a thought experiment exploring both attack and defense techniques in modern AI systems—especially in the domains of large language models (LLMs), vision-language models (VLMs), and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems. Here’s a high-level breakdown of the themes and insights represented:\n\n1. Poisoning and Backdoor Attacks:\n • Several works (e.g., “joint-gcg: unified gradient-based poisoning attacks on retrieval-augmented generation systems” and “backdoor attack on vision language models with stealthy semantic manipulation”) study methods for inserting malicious influences or hidden triggers into models. These approaches (ranging from gradient-based poisoning to stealthy semantic manipulation) demonstrate the variety and depth of vulnerabilities that can be exploited during training or fine-tuning.\n\n2. Systematic Reviews and Vulnerability Analysis:\n • Papers such as “a systematic review of poisoning attacks against large language models” provide an overview and taxonomy of poisoning methods, helping to map out the landscape of both existing attacks and the factors that might make certain models (e.g., code LLMs) more vulnerable.\n\n3. Defensive Strategies:\n • On the defense side, works like “robust anti-backdoor instruction tuning in lvlms” and “your agent can defend itself against backdoor attacks” suggest that it is possible to build self-aware or hardening techniques into models to resist or clean malicious modifications. There is also exploration into techniques for backdoor cleaning during fine-tuning, particularly in multi-modal settings.\n\n4. Specialized Attack Vectors:\n • Some contributions target niche aspects—for instance, “merge hijacking: backdoor attacks to model merging of large language models” explores the risks inherent in merging or fine-tuning pre-trained models, and “finetuning-activated backdoors in llms” looks at the subtle ways that fine-tuning procedures may inadvertently activate hidden backdoors.\n\n5. Multi-Modal and Retrieval-Augmented Generation Systems:\n • Several entries focus on RAG systems and VLMs, reflecting their growing importance and the challenges they introduce. The interplay between different modalities (text and vision) as well as the use of retrieval mechanisms creates new avenues for both poisoning and countermeasures, as illustrated by works like “through the stealth lens: rethinking attacks and defenses in rag” and “spa-vlm: stealthy poisoning attacks on rag-based vlm”.\n\nOverall, this thought experiment underscores a dual theme in modern AI research: while increasingly sophisticated models open up new capabilities, they also expose new vulnerabilities. Researchers are actively investigating not just how to exploit these vulnerabilities (through various forms of poisoning and backdoor attacks) but also how to build more resilient models through robust training protocols, self-defensive agents, and systematic backdoor cleaning methods.\n\nIf you’re looking to explore this landscape further, you might consider:\n – Investigating the interplay between attack techniques and mitigation strategies.\n – Analyzing how different model architectures (LLM, VLM, RAG) influence both the success of attacks and the efficacy of defenses.\n – Considering the implications of these vulnerabilities for real-world applications and security protocols.\n\nThis snapshot from the imagined 2025 literature provides a rich foundation for discussing both the evolution of adversarial techniques in machine learning and the ongoing efforts to safeguard AI systems against such attacks.",

          "response": "Below is a brief, high-level overview of the themes and research directions that appear in the listed references on poisoning and backdoor attacks in (vision-)language models. Although these citations are futuristic (dated 2025), they reflect current or projected lines of work focusing on how attackers can covertly compromise training and inference pipelines, as well as potential strategies to defend against such threats.\n\n1) Anti-Backdoor Instruction Tuning in Vision–Language Models  \n   • Explores how instruction tuning can be modified to detect or neutralize backdoors in multimodal architectures.  \n   • Discusses methods for robust fine-tuning that reduce a backdoor’s effectiveness without severely damaging model utility or performance.  \n\n2) Unified Gradient-Based Poisoning Attacks on Retrieval-Augmented Generation Systems  \n   • Introduces gradient-based optimization techniques for poisoning training data or the retriever component underlying large language models with an external knowledge base.  \n   • Examines how subtle manipulations in retrieval-augmented pipelines can mislead final outputs with minimal data corruption.  \n\n3) Stealthy Semantic Manipulation Attacks on Vision–Language Models  \n   • Demonstrates how imperceptible changes in training or inference data (e.g., small pixel-level edits or carefully encoded prompts) can trigger malicious behaviors or targeted misclassifications.  \n   • Proposes new attack vectors leveraging cross-modal alignment vulnerabilities (image-text pairs).  \n\n4) Systematic Reviews of Poisoning Attacks Against Large Language Models  \n   • Surveys a broad spectrum of poisoning attacks: data poisoning, gradient or weight manipulation, and backdoor triggers.  \n   • Examines common strategies, objectives, and defenses, identifying what makes large-scale NLP systems uniquely susceptible.  \n\n5) Defending Agents Against Backdoor Attacks  \n   • Focuses on agent-based large language models (for instance, models capable of planning or tool usage).  \n   • Highlights how malicious triggers can be injected into the chain-of-thought or external tool calls, and surveys possible real-time defenses.  \n\n6) Factors That Make Code LLMs Vulnerable to Backdoor Attacks  \n   • Investigates distinct vulnerabilities in code-oriented foundation models, such as sensitive dependencies on certain “style” or syntax triggers.  \n   • Evaluates practical attacks that degrade code generation quality, correctness, or safety.  \n\n7) Aggregating Scattered Training Patches in Vision–Language Models  \n   • Shows how partially “poisoned” patches scattered within large training corpora (images, text descriptions) can still be aggregated by the model into a functional trigger.  \n   • Emphasizes the risk of incomplete or distributed poisoning that remains undetected by traditional data-cleaning heuristics.  \n\n8) Attacks and Defenses in Retrieval-Augmented Generation Through the Stealth Lens  \n   • Reconsiders RAG systems from the perspective of stealth: how minimal, hidden modifications in the retrieval corpus can yield large changes in model outputs.  \n   • Covers both offensive and defensive strategies for stealthy manipulations, including detection and filtering.  \n\n9) Stealthy Poisoning Attacks on Retrieval-Augmented Vision–Language Models (Spa-VLM)  \n   • Narrows the focus to retrieval-augmented vision–language pipelines and demonstrates how to craft innocent-looking data that triggers malicious behaviors during inference.  \n\n10) Benchmarking Poisoning Attacks Against Retrieval-Augmented Generation  \n    • Presents a standardized framework to compare different adversarial methods targeting retrieval-augmented language models.  \n    • Proposes metrics to measure success (e.g., trigger activation rate, stealthiness, impact on normal performance).  \n\n11) Covert Poisoning Attacks (CPA-RAG) on Retrieval-Augmented Generation in Large Language Models  \n    • Attempts to hide malicious data or instructions within large sets of unstructured text, often masked as noise or textual anomalies.  \n    • Describes advanced stealth tactics, such as multi-stage triggers or input reconstruction, to ward off straightforward filtering tools.  \n\n12) Backdoor Attacks Targeting Model Merging in LLMs  \n    • Focuses on how merging or fine-tuning multiple LLM checkpoints can carry over malicious weights or trigger conditions from one model to another.  \n    • Highlights the unique risk that arises when open-source communities merge third-party models.  \n\n13) Finetuning-Activated Backdoors in LLMs  \n    • Shows that certain backdoors remain dormant (with minimal impact on upstream tasks) and become fully active only after further fine-tuning.  \n    • Emphasizes the need for monitoring and verification post-finetuning, not just post-pretraining.  \n\n14) Backdoor Training Without External Guidance in Multimodal Fine-Tuning  \n    • Describes how an attacker can inject backdoors during a typical multimodal fine-tuning process—even without direct control over the entire dataset.  \n    • Investigates model vulnerabilities when multiple modalities (e.g., images, text) are integrated in new tasks or domains.  \n\nCOMMON THEMES AND TAKEAWAYS:  \n• Stealthiness: Many of these works emphasize that truly dangerous poisoning or backdoor attacks remain hidden and only manifest at inference through a specific trigger.  \n• Multi-stage Triggers: Dormant or partially active triggers can evade detection by standard model auditing and data-cleaning pipelines; they become fully activated only under certain conditions.  \n• Retrieval-Augmented Generation: Attacks can target not only the model weights but also the external retrieval database, causing partial or context-dependent misbehavior.  \n• Defenses & Verification: Proposed defenses range from robust fine-tuning or prompt engineering to scanning for hidden triggers, verifying merges, and using specialized detection methods.  \n• Code-Specific Attacks: In addition to general NLP vulnerabilities, code generation poses unique risks, e.g., malicious style tokens or hidden syntax patterns.  \n\nOverall, these references underscore the increasing sophistication and variety of backdoor and poisoning attacks—particularly on large, multi-purpose generative models that integrate external knowledge sources or multiple modalities. They also highlight emerging research on defense mechanisms, though, as the references suggest, the arms race between attackers and defenders is ongoing.",

Poison & Backdoor\n\n## 1. Robust Anti-Backdoor Instruction Tuning in LVLMs ([arXiv:2506.05401](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05401))\n**Goal:** Develop instruction tuning methods for Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) that are robust to backdoor attacks.\n**Steps:**\n- Identify how backdoor instructions can be injected during instruction tuning.\n- Propose robust training strategies (e.g., data filtering, loss regularization) to mitigate the effect of poisoned instructions.\n- Evaluate robustness under various backdoor threat models.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Joint-GCG: Unified Gradient-Based Poisoning Attacks on Retrieval-Augmented Generation Systems ([arXiv:2506.06151](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06151))\n**Goal:** Present a general gradient-based framework for poisoning attacks on Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems.\n**Steps:**\n- Formulate the poisoning attack as an optimization problem, leveraging gradients to select/mutate data.\n- Apply the method to both the retriever and generator in RAG setups.\n- Evaluate on LLM-based RAG pipelines, showing increased susceptibility to targeted outputs.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Backdoor Attack on Vision Language Models with Stealthy Semantic Manipulation ([arXiv:2506.07214](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07214))\n**Goal:** Inject backdoors into VLMs via subtle, semantically meaningful triggers.\n**Steps:**\n- Design triggers that are hard to detect (e.g., small semantic perturbation in images or captions).\n- Insert poisoned samples into VLM training.\n- Demonstrate that, at inference, the presence of the trigger causes malicious behavior while remaining stealthy.\n\n---\n\n## 4. A Systematic Review of Poisoning Attacks Against Large Language Models ([arXiv:2506.06518](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06518))\n**Goal:** Survey and categorize poisoning attack methods against LLMs.\n**Steps:**\n- Review existing poisoning and backdoor attacks on LLMs.\n- Analyze attack vectors: training data, prompt injection, fine-tuning, etc.\n- Summarize defense mechanisms and open challenges.\n\n---\n\n## 5. Your Agent Can Defend Itself against Backdoor Attacks ([arXiv:2506.08336](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08336))\n**Goal:** Empower LLM-based agents to detect and counteract backdoor attacks autonomously.\n**Steps:**\n- Propose self-defense mechanisms (e.g., self-consistency checks, trigger detection modules).\n- Integrate defenses into agent pipelines.\n- Show improved resilience to backdoor triggers in agent-based tasks.\n\n---\n\n## 6. Which Factors Make Code LLMs More Vulnerable to Backdoor Attacks? A Systematic Study ([arXiv:2506.01825](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01825))\n**Goal:** Identify why code LLMs are particularly susceptible to backdoors.\n**Steps:**\n- Analyze code LLM architectures and training data properties.\n- Run controlled backdoor injection experiments.\n- Highlight factors like token diversity, code structure, and pretraining choices that affect vulnerability.\n\n---\n\n## 7. VLMs Can Aggregate Scattered Training Patches ([arXiv:2506.03614](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03614))\n**Goal:** Show that VLMs can “piece together” information from scattered, seemingly innocuous training patches (potentially a stealthy attack vector).\n**Steps:**\n- Insert semantically related but scattered patches into the training set.\n- Demonstrate that VLMs can aggregate these and behave as if trained on the target (malicious) concept.\n- Underline risks of scattered or low-visibility poisoning.\n\n---\n\n## 8. Through the Stealth Lens: Rethinking Attacks and Defenses in RAG ([arXiv:2506.04390](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04390))\n**Goal:** Analyze stealthy attacks and corresponding defenses in RAG systems.\n**Steps:**\n- Define new stealth metrics for evaluating attacks.\n- Benchmark various stealthy attack strategies on RAG.\n- Discuss trade-offs between attack stealthiness and defense detectability.\n\n---\n\n## 9. Spa-VLM: Stealthy Poisoning Attacks on RAG-based VLM ([arXiv:2505.23828](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23828))\n**Goal:** Demonstrate stealthy data poisoning on Retrieval-Augmented VLMs.\n**Steps:**\n- Craft poisoned data that avoids detection in the retriever and generator.\n- Insert into training corpus of RAG-based VLMs.\n- Evaluate attack success versus stealth.\n\n---\n\n## 10. Benchmarking Poisoning Attacks against Retrieval-Augmented Generation ([arXiv:2505.18543](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18543))\n**Goal:** Systematically benchmark different poisoning attacks on RAG systems.\n**Steps:**\n- Implement a suite of poisoning strategies for RAG.\n- Measure efficacy, stealth, and transferability across tasks and model types.\n- Provide standardized benchmarks for future research.\n\n---\n\n## 11. CPA-RAG: Covert Poisoning Attacks on Retrieval-Augmented Generation in Large Language Models ([arXiv:2505.19864](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19864))\n**Goal:** Propose covert poisoning techniques tailored to RAG in LLMs.\n**Steps:**\n- Design attacks that blend poisoned data with natural corpus elements.\n- Target both retriever and generator, maximizing attack stealth.\n- Evaluate the effectiveness and covertness of these attacks.\n\n---\n\n## 12. Merge Hijacking: Backdoor Attacks to Model Merging of Large Language Models ([arXiv:2505.23561](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23561))\n**Goal:** Show that merging LLMs (e.g., via model fusion) can introduce or preserve backdoors.\n**Steps:**\n- Develop methods to create/activate backdoors during model merging.\n- Analyze how backdoors propagate or amplify after merging.\n- Propose detection or mitigation strategies for safe model merging.\n\n---\n\n## 13. Finetuning-Activated Backdoors in LLMs ([arXiv:2505.16567](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16567))\n**Goal:** Explore backdoors that remain dormant in pre-training and activate upon downstream finetuning.\n**Steps:**\n- Inject dormant backdoor triggers during pre-training.\n- Show that standard finetuning “awakens” the backdoor.\n- Discuss implications for transfer learning and security.\n\n---\n\n## 14. Backdoor Cleaning without External Guidance in MLLM Fine-tuning ([arXiv:2505.16916](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16916))\n**Goal:** Remove backdoors from Multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) during fine-tuning without external clean data.\n**Steps:**\n- Propose unsupervised or self-supervised backdoor cleaning techniques.\n- Apply during MLLM fine-tuning without needing reference data.\n- Demonstrate effectiveness in backdoor removal with minimal accuracy loss.\n\n---\n\n## Summary Table\n\n| Paper | Attack/Defense | System | Key Idea |\n|-------|---------------|--------|----------|\n| Robust Anti-Backdoor Instruction Tuning | Defense | VLM | Robust instruction tuning |\n| Joint-GCG | Attack | RAG/LLM | Unified gradient-based poisoning |\n| Stealthy Semantic Manipulation | Attack | VLM | Subtle semantic triggers |\n| Systematic Review | Survey | LLM | Taxonomy of poisoning attacks |\n| Agent Self-Defense | Defense | LLM/Agent | Self-defense by agent |\n| Code LLM Vulnerability | Analysis | LLM(Code) | Why code LLMs are vulnerable |\n| VLMs Aggregate Patches | Analysis | VLM | Scattered patch aggregation |\n| Stealth in RAG | Attack/Defense | RAG/LLM | Stealth metrics/benchmarks |\n| Spa-VLM | Attack | RAG/VLM | Stealthy poisoning on RAG VLM |\n| Poisoning Benchmark | Benchmark | RAG/LLM | Systematic benchmarking |\n| CPA-RAG | Attack | RAG/LLM | Covert poisoning RAG |\n| Merge Hijacking | Attack | LLM | Model merging backdoors |\n| Finetuning-Activated Backdoors | Attack | LLM | Dormant → activated backdoors |\n| Backdoor Cleaning | Defense | VLM | Unsupervised cleaning |\n\n---\n\nLet me know if you want a deeper breakdown of any specific paper or method!",

          "response": "Below is a paper-by-paper breakdown of key ideas, methods, and insights from the listed works on poisoning and backdoor attacks (and defenses) in large‐scale models. The goal is to help you quickly see what each paper addresses, how they do it, and the main takeaways.\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n1) Robust Anti-Backdoor Instruction Tuning in LVLMs (2025/06)\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n• Core Problem: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) can be backdoored when instruction-tuned on compromised data.  \n• Proposed Approach: Introduces a robust instruction-tuning objective that actively detects and counters suspicious gradients. By monitoring signal patterns during training, the method either dismisses or “repairs” potential triggers.  \n• Key Insight: Even when a model is given maliciously poisoned instruction pairs, carefully designed anti-backdoor objectives can thwart or mitigate hidden triggers without significantly harming normal performance.  \n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n2) Joint-GCG: Unified Gradient-Based Poisoning Attacks  \n   on Retrieval-Augmented Generation Systems (2025/06)\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n• Core Problem: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipelines rely on an external retriever and a generator network. Attackers can poison either the retriever or the generator, or both, to influence outputs.  \n• Key Mechanism: “Joint-GCG” uses gradient-based strategies to craft data poisoning that simultaneously misleads the retriever (to fetch harmful documents) and the generator (to produce targeted false or malicious responses).  \n• Contribution: Demonstrates that separate or sequential poisoning methods are less effective than a joint approach that coordinates both the retrieval and generation steps for more potent attacks.  \n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n3) Backdoor Attack on Vision Language Models  \n   with Stealthy Semantic Manipulation (2025/06)\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n• Core Problem: Embed “invisible” triggers into images or textual prompts that can stealthily activate harmful behaviors (e.g., misclassifications or biased outputs).  \n• Technique: Instead of simple pixel or token triggers, the authors propose subtle semantic modifications (e.g., hidden watermark cues in images, slight textual changes) that do not visibly distort content.  \n• Key Takeaway: VLMs, because they learn multimodal features, can be manipulated at multiple levels; stealthy semantic triggers often bypass naive detection and remain latent until a precisely combined text–image input appears.  \n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n4) A Systematic Review of Poisoning Attacks  \n   Against Large Language Models (2025/06)\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n• Scope: Surveys published works on data poisoning, gradient manipulation, backdoor triggers, and poisoning defenses specifically tailored to LLMs.  \n• Categorization: Groups attacks into training-data poisoning and inference-time triggers, with an overview of the specific vulnerabilities in large transformer architectures.  \n• Outcome: Provides a taxonomy of known defenses—ranging from data sanitization to robust training objectives—and highlights open challenges for reliably detecting sophisticated poison and backdoor strategies.  \n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n5) Your Agent Can Defend Itself against Backdoor Attacks (2025/06)\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n• Context: Many LLM-based “agents” autonomously operate on external data and can inadvertently learn or activate backdoors.  \n• Defense Method: Introduces an agent-side verification system that audits incoming tasks, instructions, and training data. If suspicious patterns are detected, the agent either halts or switches to a “safe mode.”  \n• Broader Impact: Suggests that the agent’s self-checking routines can mitigate backdoors in dynamic or continuous-learning settings, reducing reliance on external data curators.  \n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n6) Which Factors Make Code LLMs More Vulnerable  \n   to Backdoor Attacks? A Systematic Study (2025/06)\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n• Target Domain: LLMs specialized in code generation (e.g., for software development).  \n• Investigation: Systematically evaluates how factors like model size, training strategy, or code-domain specifics (e.g., consistent syntax structures) affect backdoor insertion and activation.  \n• Findings: Larger models can memorize hidden triggers more easily, while certain code-specific patterns (like repeated function templates) can inadvertently serve as triggers or amplify vulnerability.  \n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n7) VLMs Can Aggregate Scattered Training Patches (2025/06)\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n• Poisoning Angle: This work shows that Vision-Language Models can “connect the dots” even if attackers split a malicious modification across many small patches in the training set.  \n• Mechanism: Subtle modifications in text or images are scattered and individually harmless, but collectively form a meaningful trigger once the VLM learns to aggregate them.  \n• Implication: Traditional data-cleaning methods that look for suspicious outliers may miss these “scattered” micro-poisoning patterns, illustrating the need for more holistic defenses.  \n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n8) Through the Stealth Lens: Rethinking Attacks  \n   and Defenses in RAG (2025/06)\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n• Focus: Attacks on Retrieval-Augmented Generation systems that emphasize “stealth”—i.e., making the poison undetectable through standard screening.  \n• Method: Explores how stealth triggers, minimal textual changes, or recessive embeddings can corrupt the retriever or degrade generation quality surreptitiously.  \n• Defense Discussion: Argues that new threat models require multi-layer protection (retriever, generator, and data curation) rather than tackling each module independently.  \n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n9) Spa-VLM: Stealthy Poisoning Attacks on RAG-based VLM (2025/05)\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n• Attack Modality: Vision-Language Models that rely on external knowledge bases or retrieval components.  \n• Stealth Tactics: Introduces poisoning data whose malicious triggers are carefully designed to blend into normal visual or textual content, evading typical anomaly detection.  \n• Main Result: Demonstrates how subtle “style” changes in images/text (e.g., tinted color patterns, synonyms that preserve semantics) can become triggers that remain dormant until the RAG process fetches them.  \n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n10) Benchmarking Poisoning Attacks against  \n    Retrieval-Augmented Generation (2025/05)\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n• Contribution: Establishes a systematic benchmark that measures attacker success and stealth, covering multiple RAG pipelines, datasets, and threat models.  \n• Comparative Experiments: Evaluates various poisoning strategies (label flipping, gradient-based, stealth triggers) to see which are most damaging under real-world constraints.  \n• Practical Utility: Helps researchers standardize testing of new defenses and measure real impacts of different poisoning approaches in RAG settings.  \n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n11) CPA-RAG: Covert Poisoning Attacks on Retrieval-Augmented  \n    Generation in Large Language Models (2025/05)\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n• Core Theme: “Covert” poisoning emphasizes minimal or no visible footprints—small textual modifications or disguised data entries that hamper retrieval or mislead generation.  \n• Key Technique: Leveraging cluster-level or corpus-level manipulations that degrade the retrieval process, leading the generator to produce harmful or incorrect completions.  \n• Takeaway: Even minor, scattered changes in public corpora could drastically affect retrieval quality and produce systematically biased or malicious outputs across many queries.  \n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n12) Merge Hijacking: Backdoor Attacks to Model Merging  \n    of Large Language Models (2025/05) [ACL’25 Main]\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n• Context: Merging two or more pretrained LLMs (often through parameter interpolation/fusion) is a common technique to combine capabilities.  \n• Vulnerability: Demonstrates that an attacker can stash hidden triggers in one of the “merge” models. When it is fused with another model, the subversive triggers remain intact and reemerge post-merge.  \n• Implication: Highlights a new risk where collaborative or open-source model merging can inadvertently import backdoors from unknown contributors.  \n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n13) Finetuning-Activated Backdoors in LLMs (2025/05)\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n• Observation: Some backdoors remain relatively dormant until a model undergoes a subsequent finetuning step, at which point the triggers become functional.  \n• Mechanism: Attackers can insert specialized triggers during pretraining that are only activated by certain finetuning tasks or data distributions.  \n• Significance: Underscores the importance of scanning or verifying a model both before and after finetuning, rather than assuming that only the final checkpoint can be compromised.  \n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n14) Backdoor Cleaning without External Guidance  \n    in MLLM Fine-tuning (2025/05)\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n• Problem Statement: In Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) finetuning, there isn’t always an external “clean” dataset or oracle to guide backdoor removal.  \n• Proposed Solution: Proposes a self-based cleaning strategy that detects suspicious parameters or functionality by comparing internal consistency across text–image pairs.  \n• Conclusion: Shows partial success in rooting out or neutralizing embedded backdoors without needing a known-clean reference dataset or specialized external tools.  \n\n════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════\nKey Broad Takeaways\n════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════\n• Backdoor vs. Poison Distinction: “Backdoor” focuses on hidden triggers that produce specific malicious outputs on cue, while “poisoning” can degrade a model’s integrity more generally (including backdoors, label flips, or stealth manipulations).  \n• RAG-Specific Challenges: Many recent works highlight how retrieval components multiply the threat surface—poisoning can happen in the retriever, corpus, or generator.  \n• Stealth & Latency: Attackers increasingly use subtle triggers—semantic or distributed “scattered training patches”—making detection harder.  \n• Defensive Trends: Approaches like robust training objectives, self-verification, and dynamic scanning help mitigate attacks. However, no single defense is fully foolproof, especially in open ecosystems or data-merging scenarios.  \n\nThese papers collectively map out a fast-evolving area of research around poisoning and backdoor attacks (and defenses) in Large Language Models (LLMs), Vision-Language Models (VLMs), and their retrieval-augmented peers.",

          "response": "Ce texte semble être une liste structurée (probablement issue d’un document de recherche ou d’un index de projets) sous le titre « B3. Poison et porte arrière ». Voici quelques observations sur sa composition et ce qu’il pourrait signifier :\n\n1. Structure de la liste  \n   • Chaque ligne débute par un identifiant de type « __token_X__ » et présente ensuite un élément en gras (aussi indiqué par un token, par exemple « __ token_Y__ ») suivi d’un lien vers une prépublication sur arXiv.  \n   • Immédiatement après, on trouve un ou plusieurs badges issus de shields.io. Ces badges affichent apparemment un type ou une catégorie (par exemple “vlm”, “llm”, “rag”, “agent”, ou même “acl'25_main”).\n\n2. Interprétation des termes  \n   • « Poison et porte arrière » se réfère généralement aux techniques de poisoning (empoisonnement des données ou modèle) ainsi qu’aux backdoors (portes dérobées) qui sont des vulnérabilités introduites de manière malveillante dans les systèmes d’apprentissage automatique.  \n   • Les abréviations des badges semblent indiquer le domaine ou le type de modèle concerné :  \n  – « vlm » pourrait se référer à des modèles visuo-langagiers (Vision-Language Models)  \n  – « llm » renvoie aux grands modèles de langage (Large Language Models)  \n  – « rag » pourrait être relié à des approches impliquant la récupération d’information (Retrieval Augmented Generation)  \n  – « agent » pourrait indiquer des agents autonomes ou des systèmes d’IA agissant dans un cadre particulier  \n  – La mention « acl'25_main » suggère une référence à un travail ou une session principale d’un congrès (par exemple, ACL 2025)\n\n3. Contenu et but possible  \n   • Chaque ligne semble référencer une publication (via son lien arXiv) qui a potentiellement traité des attaques par empoisonnement ou intégré des mécanismes de porte dérobée dans différents types de modèles d’IA.  \n   • La présence systématique des badges peut signaler que l’auteur du document veut catégoriser ces travaux en fonction de leur domaine d’application ou de leur type de modèle, facilitant ainsi la navigation au sein d’un panorama de recherches sur la sécurité des modèles d’IA.\n\nEn résumé, il s’agit d’un inventaire ou d’un index de travaux académiques portant sur des problématiques de sécurité (empoisonnement des données ou backdoors) appliquées à divers types de modèles d’IA. Chaque entrée fournit à la fois une source (via arXiv) et une information visuelle rapide (le badge) pour identifier le type de modèle ou de méthode abordé dans l’étude citée.",

          "response": "В современном домене больших языковых (LLM) и мультимодальных (VLM) моделей проблема целенаправленных атак на этапах обучения и разметки данных привлекает всё больше внимания. Под “ядом” (poisoning) обычно имеют в виду внесение преднамеренных искажений в обучающие данные с тем, чтобы модель в целом или частично начала выдавать некорректные результаты. “Бэкдор” (backdoor-атака) рассматривается как частный случай “яда”, когда в модель добавляют “триггер” — скрытый шаблон в данных, при наличии которого уже натренированная модель начинает вести себя определённым образом (например, выдавать заведомо неверную информацию или нарушать желаемую политику ответа).\n\nНиже — обобщённый обзор того, что обычно обсуждается в исследованиях на эту тему (включая те, что могут быть приведены по указанным ссылкам):\n\n1. Масштабы уязвимостей.  \n   • Чем больше данных нужно для обучения, тем сложнее их верифицировать. Злоумышленник может целенаправленно “подмешивать” модифицированные сэмплы, оставаясь при этом незамеченным.  \n   • Сложность сетевых архитектур усложняет корректную интерпретацию работы модели: вредоносные паттерны могут не проявляться при обычном тестировании.\n\n2. Техники “яда” (poisoning).  \n   • Подмена меток (label flipping), когда объекты одного класса получают метку другого, что приводит к в целом сниженному качеству модели.  \n   • Добавление артефактов или “шумовых” модификаций в текстовые или визуальные данные, не привлекающих внимания, но меняющих распределение данных.  \n   • Целевое занижение качества на конкретных задачах или сегментах данных (targeted misclassification).\n\n3. Бэкдор-атаки:\n   • Встраивание скрытого “триггера” в часть обучающего набора. С моделью в обычных условиях всё в порядке, но при появлении в новом входном сигнале данного триггера она выдаёт заранее закодированный “сбой” или другую нештатную реакцию.  \n   • Триггеры могут быть визуальными (специальные пиксели, watermark-и, паттерны) или текстовыми (уникальный сленг, кодовые слова).  \n   • Особая сложность в том, что корректная работа модели не вызывает подозрений до появления триггера.\n\n4. Последствия для LLM и VLM:\n   • Злонамеренное управление ответами: ввод “секретного” текста или маркеров может заставить LLM перейти к нежелательному сценариям диалога.  \n   • Распространение дезинформации: модель может “уверенно” давать ложный контент при введении определённых ключевых слов.  \n   • Компрометация мультимодальных моделей: при наличии специфических пиксельных шаблонов вывод становится неправильным или искажённым.\n\n5. Методы противодействия:\n   • Многоступенчатая проверка качества данных (в том числе аномалийное детектирование и фильтрация).  \n   • “Очищающие” перетренировки и механизмы fine-tuning с защитой от отравленных сэмплов (например, с использованием robust-методов).  \n   • Анализ активаций нейронной сети (neural fingerprinting) и отслеживание подозрительной активации триггеров.  \n   • Регулярный аудит и перепроверка результатов модели на контрольных наборах данных.\n\nТаким образом, “яд” и “бэкдор” — это во многом родственные типы атак, которые используют слабые места в обучении больших моделей. Если простая “отравленная” выборка ухудшает глобальное качество, то “бэкдор” изощрённее: он выводит модель из нормального состояния только при определённом условии (триггере). Вопросы безопасности и криптографической стойкости таких систем становятся всё более важными и активно обсуждаются в новейших публикациях.",

Here’s an overview summary of the recent research on Poison & Backdoor attacks in LLMs/VLMs/RAGs based on your curated list (2025/05–2025/06):\n\n### Poison & Backdoor Attacks in Modern AI Systems: Overview (2025)\n\n#### 1. **Types of Attacks Studied**\n- **Backdoor Attacks:** Malicious triggers that cause models to behave incorrectly when specific inputs are present. Explored in both LLMs and VLMs ([Backdoor Attack on Vision Language Models...](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07214), [Finetuning-Activated Backdoors in LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16567), [Merge Hijacking: Backdoor Attacks...](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23561)).\n- **Poisoning Attacks:** Manipulation of training data to degrade or subvert model behavior. Includes retrieval-augmented systems ([Benchmarking Poisoning Attacks against Retrieval-Augmented Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18543), [CPA-RAG: Covert Poisoning Attacks...](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19864), [Joint-GCG: Unified Gradient-Based Poisoning...](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06151)).\n- **Stealthy/Semantic Attacks:** Emphasis on attacks that evade detection by being subtle or semantically meaningful ([Spa-VLM: Stealthy Poisoning Attacks...](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23828), [Through the Stealth Lens: Rethinking Attacks...](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04390)).\n\n#### 2. **Targeted Systems**\n- **LLMs (Large Language Models):** Most work focuses on text-based models and their vulnerabilities to both poisoning and backdoors.\n- **VLMs (Vision-Language Models):** Increasing attention on multi-modal models and their unique vulnerabilities ([VLMs Can Aggregate Scattered Training Patches](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03614), [Backdoor Attack on Vision Language Models...](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07214)).\n- **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation):** Special focus on attacks and defenses in systems augmenting generation with external knowledge ([CPA-RAG](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19864), [Benchmarking Poisoning Attacks...](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18543)).\n\n#### 3. **New Attack Vectors**\n- **Model Merging:** New vector via backdooring during the merging of LLMs ([Merge Hijacking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23561)).\n- **Fine-tuning Process:** Backdoors that are silent until after fine-tuning ([Finetuning-Activated Backdoors in LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16567)).\n- **Gradient-Based Attacks:** Unified frameworks for attacking via gradients ([Joint-GCG](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06151)).\n\n#### 4. **Defenses & Mitigations**\n- **Self-Defending Agents:** Research shows agents can autonomously defend against some backdoor attacks ([Your Agent Can Defend Itself Against Backdoor Attacks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08336)).\n- **Backdoor Cleaning:** New methods for removing backdoors without external (clean) data ([Backdoor Cleaning without External Guidance...](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16916)).\n- **Systematic Reviews:** Comprehensive surveys to guide future defenses and risk assessments ([A Systematic Review of Poisoning Attacks Against LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06518)).\n\n#### 5. **Factors Affecting Vulnerability**\n- **Code LLMs:** Specific study on what makes code-focused LLMs especially vulnerable to backdoors ([Which Factors Produce Code LLMs More Vulnerable...](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01825)).\n- **Instruction Tuning:** Robustness challenges in instruction tuning for VLMs ([Robust Anti-Backdoor Instruction Tuning in LVLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05401)).\n\n---\n\n## Key Trends & Takeaways\n\n- **Evolving Threats:** Both attack and defense methods are becoming more sophisticated. There is a move from basic poisoning to stealthy, semantic, and context-aware attacks.\n- **RAG as a Hotspot:** Retrieval-augmented systems are particularly vulnerable due to their reliance on external data sources.\n- **Defense is Catching Up:** There is notable progress in detection, cleaning, and even self-healing agent techniques.\n- **Need for Benchmarks:** Several works propose systematic benchmarking and taxonomy to better understand and compare attack/defense efficacy.\n\n---\n\n### If you want deeper notes or a taxonomy-style breakdown, let me know!",

A Systematic Study (2025/06)  \n  - Focus: Analyzes factors that render code-focused LLMs (e.g., coding assistants) particularly susceptible to backdoor and poisoning threats.  \n  - Contribution: Highlights architecture-, data-, and finetuning-related factors that influence vulnerability, helping guide defenses.\n\n• Merge Hijacking: Backdoor Attacks to Model Merging of Large Language Models (2025/05)  \n  - Focus: Examines how merging separately trained LLM checkpoints can inadvertently introduce backdoors.  \n  - Contribution: Demonstrates merging-based vulnerabilities and suggests protocols to detect or prevent such hijacking.\n\n• Finetuning-Activated Backdoors in LLMs (2025/05)  \n  - Focus: Explores the phenomenon in which an LLM remains “clean” until finetuning on certain data activates a latent backdoor trigger.  \n  - Contribution: Illustrates how well-crafted triggers remain dormant until user or developer finetuning inadvertently activates them.\n\n• Your Agent Can Defend Itself against Backdoor Attacks (2025/06)  \n  - Focus: Targets agent-based LLMs (e.g., chain-of-thought or multi-step decision-making systems) and proposes self-defense techniques.  \n  - Contribution: Introduces strategies enabling an LLM “agent” to detect unusually triggered behavior and neutralize potential backdoors.\n\n• Backdoor Cleaning without External Guidance in MLLM Fine-tuning (2025/05)  \n  - Focus: Applies backdoor purification techniques to Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) without requiring external supervision.  \n  - Contribution: Shows how standard or lightly modified finetuning routines can eliminate hidden triggers without manual annotations.\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n2) Poisoning & Backdoor Attacks in Vision-Language Models (VLM)\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n• Backdoor Attack on Vision Language Models with Stealthy Semantic Manipulation (2025/06)  \n  - Focus: Discusses subtle semantic modifications (e.g., slightly altering text or images) that trigger malicious behaviors in VLMs.  \n  - Contribution: Proposes an attack pipeline that remains nearly invisible while still reliably activating the backdoor.\n\n• VLMs Can Aggregate Scattered Training Patches (2025/06)  \n  - Focus: Explores how VLMs can learn from (and potentially combine) scattered, seemingly benign training inputs that collectively embed a backdoor.  \n  - Contribution: Shows how partial image or text segments can be stitched together to form an effective stealthy trigger.\n\n• Spa-VLM: Stealthy Poisoning Attacks on RAG-based VLM (2025/05)  \n  - Focus: Investigates the case of VLMs augmented with external retrieval (RAG) modules, targeting them with covert poisoning.  \n  - Contribution: Demonstrates how attackers can stealthily inject malicious information that is retrieved at inference to manipulate responses.\n\n──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n3) Poisoning & Backdoor Attacks in Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)\n──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n• Joint-GCG: Unified Gradient-Based Poisoning Attacks on RAG Systems (2025/06)  \n  - Focus: Proposes a gradient-based approach to craft cohesive “poisoned” data for both the retriever and the generator.  \n  - Contribution: Bridges the gap between retrieval attacks and generation attacks, yielding more universal poisoning tactics.\n\n• Through the Stealth Lens: Rethinking Attacks and Defenses in RAG (2025/06)  \n  - Focus: Considers stealthiness as a critical factor, investigating how RAG systems can be subtly manipulated while evading detection.  \n  - Contribution: Proposes new metrics and frameworks for measuring stealth, along with preliminary defensive strategies.\n\n• Benchmarking Poisoning Attacks against Retrieval-Augmented Generation (2025/05)  \n  - Focus: Systematically evaluates multiple poisoning attack methods on RAG-based LLMs.  \n  - Contribution: Provides a benchmark suite for comparing effectiveness, stealth, and execution complexity of different approaches.\n\n• CPA-RAG: Covert Poisoning Attacks on Retrieval-Augmented Generation in Large Language Models (2025/05)  \n  - Focus: Designed specifically for covert poisoning in RAG pipelines, taking advantage of the pipeline’s multi-stage nature.  \n  - Contribution: Demonstrates how small sets of “contaminated” documents can trigger large behavioral shifts in downstream generation.\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nOverall Themes & Key Takeaways\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n• Stealth and stealthiness emerge as primary concerns, with many works emphasizing minimal, subtle changes to training data or model parameters that produce dramatic effects.  \n• Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) models introduce a two-tier vulnerability: malicious content placed in the retriever’s corpus can yield harmful outputs even if the core model initially appears benign.  \n• Code-focused LLMs exhibit unique backdoor vulnerabilities due to the structured nature of code and the specialized training data they consume.  \n• Model-merging and finetuning steps are increasingly recognized as “activation points,” where previously dormant backdoors can be awakened, demanding new forensic and preventive techniques.  \n• Defenses rely on robust model design, detection of anomalous triggers, and “backdoor cleaning” approaches that aim to remove latent triggers without deep oversight or external guidance.\n\nIf you are interested in a more detailed discussion of any particular paper, or in comparisons among specific methods, please let me know!",

They often aim to ensure model robustness and safety despite adversarial manipulation.  \n\nIf you have a specific question—such as wanting more detail on any of these methods, how they work technically, or how to implement (or prevent) them—feel free to let me know!",

Here is an academic-style analysis and synthesis of the listed works under the theme of “Poison & Backdoor” attacks and defenses in Large Language Models (LLMs), Vision-Language Models (VLMs), and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems, based on recent (2025) arXiv preprints:\n\n---\n\n## Academic Analysis: Poison & Backdoor Attacks in Foundation Models (2025)\n\n### 1. Overview and Scope\n\nRecent advancements in large foundation models, including LLMs and VLMs, have been accompanied by growing concerns around their vulnerability to data poisoning and backdoor attacks. These threats present significant security risks, particularly as such models are increasingly deployed in real-world, safety-critical applications and as components within larger systems (e.g., RAG pipelines, multi-agent settings).\n\n### 2. Main Attack Vectors\n\n#### 2.1. Data Poisoning in RAG and LLMs\nSeveral works ([Joint-GCG](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06151), [CPA-RAG](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19864), [Benchmarking Poisoning Attacks against RAG](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18543), [Spa-VLM](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23828)), focus on poisoning the external knowledge sources used by RAG systems. These studies demonstrate that introducing malicious documents or retrieval-relevant triggers can reliably manipulate model outputs, often with high stealthiness and transferability.\n\n#### 2.2. Backdoors via Model Merging and Finetuning\nAttacks exploiting model merging ([Merge Hijacking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23561)) and finetuning processes ([Finetuning-Activated Backdoors in LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16567)) reveal new threat surfaces. These approaches show that backdoors can be injected or activated during post-pretraining model customization, sometimes in ways that evade conventional backdoor detection methods.\n\n#### 2.3. Backdoors in VLMs and Code LLMs\nAttacks targeting VLMs ([Backdoor Attack on VLM with Stealthy Semantic Manipulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07214), [Spa-VLM](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23828)), and code-centric LLMs ([Which Factors Make Code LLMs More Vulnerable...](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01825)) highlight modality-specific vulnerabilities. Notably, VLMs can aggregate scattered poisoned image-text pairs ([VLMs Can Aggregate Scattered Training Patches](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03614)), increasing the risk of distributed, low-rate poisoning.\n\n### 3. Systematic Reviews and Taxonomy\n\n- [A Systematic Review of Poisoning Attacks Against Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06518) synthesizes attack methodologies, threat models, and empirical findings in the field, providing a valuable taxonomy and highlighting the rapidly evolving landscape of LLM security research.\n\n### 4. Defense Mechanisms\n\n#### 4.1. Model-Intrinsic Defense\n- [Your Agent Can Defend Itself against Backdoor Attacks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08336) proposes agent-level self-defense strategies, leveraging introspective mechanisms and adversarial training to detect and neutralize backdoor activations.\n- [Robust Anti-Backdoor Instruction Tuning in LVLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05401) explores instruction-tuning protocols that improve model resistance to backdoor triggers, specifically in multimodal settings.\n\n#### 4.2. Backdoor Removal without External Guidance\n- [Backdoor Cleaning without External Guidance in MLLM Fine-tuning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16916) introduces unsupervised cleaning methods, reducing reliance on clean validation sets or human oversight during model debiasing.\n\n#### 4.3. Rethinking Defenses in RAG\n- [Through the Stealth Lens: Rethinking Attacks and Defenses in RAG](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04390) reevaluates threat models considering highly stealthy attacks, arguing for more robust retrieval pipeline auditing and anomaly detection.\n\n### 5. Key Insights and Trends\n\n- **Stealth and Transferability:** Poisoning and backdoor attacks are becoming more subtle, often evading traditional detection, and can transfer across tasks and domains.\n- **Post-hoc Vulnerabilities:** Model merging and finetuning stages are now recognized as vulnerable points, not just pretraining.\n- **RAG as a Security Weak Point:** The reliance on external knowledge sources in RAG pipelines opens new attack surfaces.\n- **Modality-Specific Risks:** VLMs and code LLMs exhibit unique vulnerabilities, necessitating tailored defenses.\n\n### 6. Open Problems and Future Directions\n\n- **Automated and Generalizable Defenses:** Scaling defenses without heavy human-in-the-loop requirements remains unsolved.\n- **Benchmarking and Evaluation:** Standardized benchmarks for attack realism and defense efficacy are still developing ([Benchmarking Poisoning Attacks against RAG](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18543)).\n- **Explainability and Forensics:** Improving forensic tools to attribute and understand attacks post-hoc is an ongoing challenge.\n\n---\n\n## References (2025)\n\n1.

This work studies strategies to detect and sanitize such triggers without significantly degrading normal performance.  \n   • Academic Significance: Points to the increasing importance of robust instruction-tuning workflows in multimodal architectures, especially given that instruction tuning has grown ubiquitous for aligning model behavior with user instructions.\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n2) Joint-GCG: Unified Gradient-Based Poisoning Attacks on Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) Systems\n   • Focus: A single, end-to-end approach—“unified gradient-based poisoning”—that targets both the retriever and the generator components in RAG pipelines.  \n   • Key Idea: By optimizing attacks in a joint manner (rather than attacking the retriever and generator separately), adversaries can craft training data or parameter modifications that more effectively insert harmful behaviors or manipulate outputs.  \n   • Academic Significance: Highlights how coupling between retrieval and generation can become a new attack vector. Demonstrates the necessity for integrated defense techniques spanning the entire RAG pipeline.\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n3) Backdoor Attack on Vision Language Models with Stealthy Semantic Manipulation\n   • Focus: Stealthy semantic triggers that subtly alter the visual or textual domain to activate backdoors.  \n   • Key Idea: Unlike “visible” triggers (e.g., a patch on an image), the paper explores manipulations that remain semantically consistent or imperceptible. This stealth factor allows the backdoor to evade conventional anomaly or outlier detection.  \n   • Academic Significance: Underscores the sophistication of advanced backdoors in multimodal settings, requiring detection methods that look beyond naive watermark-like triggers.\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n4) A Systematic Review of Poisoning Attacks Against Large Language Models\n   • Focus: Survey and taxonomy of poisoning attacks, including data poisoning, backdoor insertion, Trojan attacks, and more.  \n   • Key Idea: Identifies core attack surfaces (pretraining, fine-tuning, instruction tuning, etc.) and compiles known defense strategies.  \n   • Academic Significance: Provides researchers a foundation for understanding state-of-the-art poisoning methods, bridging the gap between single-modal (NLP) and multimodal (vision-language) contexts.\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n5) Your Agent Can Defend Itself against Backdoor Attacks\n   • Focus: Defensive strategies that let an autonomous LLM-based “Agent” detect and neutralize suspected backdoors in real time.  \n   • Key Idea: Proposes having the language-based agent monitor certain signals (e.g., unusual triggers, unexpected text patterns) and self-adjust or quarantine suspicious components.  \n   • Academic Significance: Shifts from purely post-hoc detection (by separate software) to a more active agent-level defense. This shows how LLM-based systems can internalize introspection or “self-defense” routines.\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n6) Which Factors Make Code LLMs More Vulnerable to Backdoor Attacks? A Systematic Study\n   • Focus: Backdoor vulnerabilities in code-generating LLMs (e.g., models specialized for programming tasks).  \n   • Key Idea: Explores how aspects like model size, fine-tuning objectives, or code-domain tokens can increase susceptibility to Trojan triggers.  \n   • Academic Significance: Clarifies domain-specific threats. Code LLMs may inadvertently embed malicious code fragments into outputs once “activated,” making it critical to understand how to robustly train them.\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n7) VLMs Can Aggregate Scattered Training Patches\n   • Focus: How vision-language models can aggregate or compose small, seemingly benign training patches in ways that yield emergent malicious behaviors.  \n   • Key Idea: “Scattered patches” individually do not raise suspicion; however, collectively they form strong triggers.  \n   • Academic Significance: Demonstrates that VLMs’ compositional powers—normally a benefit for generalization—can be exploited for stealthy backdoor insertion.\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n8) Through the Stealth Lens: Rethinking Attacks and Defenses in RAG\n   • Focus: Chronicling new forms of stealth-based data (or retrieval) poisoning in RAG setups and how to defend.  \n   • Key Idea: Introduces frameworks to measure and improve stealth while also proposing updated detection or robust retrieval strategies.  \n   • Academic Significance: Reaffirms that RAG systems remain a prime target: by corrupting the retriever or knowledge corpus, attackers can subvert generative outputs in ways that are extremely difficult to detect.\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n9) Spa-VLM: Stealthy Poisoning Attacks on RAG-based VLM\n   • Focus: “Spa” presumably stands for “ stealthy poisoning attacks,” targeting VLMs leveraged in retrieval-augmented pipelines.  \n   • Key Idea: Proposes new trigger patterns that remain non-obvious to standard detection, using subtle visual or textual signals that can slip past data-cleaning filters.  \n   • Academic Significance: Emphasizes the synergy of poisoning and stealth in the increasingly popular domain of RAG-based vision-language tasks.\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n10) Benchmarking Poisoning Attacks against Retrieval-Augmented Generation\n    • Focus: A comprehensive benchmark that compares and evaluates multiple poisoning attacks across standard RAG tasks.  \n    • Key Idea: Provides a uniform testbed with metrics for stealth, success rate, and model degradation.  \n    • Academic Significance: Helps the community systematically compare different methods, spurring more robust and generalizable defenses.\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n11) CPA-RAG: Covert Poisoning Attacks on RAG-based LLMs\n    • Focus: “Covert Poisoning Attacks (CPA)” on retrieval-augmented pipelines for LLMs.  \n    • Key Idea: By focusing on “covert” triggers or data manipulations, attackers can co-opt the retrieval process in subtle ways, affecting downstream text generation only under certain contexts.  \n    • Academic Significance: Continues the theme that RAG’s reliance on external data indexing gives adversaries a fresh vantage point to inject malicious content, suggesting the need for multi-layer detection methods.\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n12) Merge Hijacking: Backdoor Attacks to Model Merging of Large Language Models\n    • Focus: Exploiting model-merging steps (e.g., model averaging or “merging endpoints” from separate LLMs) as an injection point for hidden backdoors.  \n    • Key Idea: Attackers produce a specially manipulated model to be merged with a benign model, leading to backdoor functionality that emerges only post-merge.  \n    • Academic Significance: Exposes a novel threat in the model-lifecycle pipeline: collaborative development or ensemble methods can inadvertently open the door to malicious merges.\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n13) Finetuning-Activated Backdoors in LLMs\n    • Focus: Backdoors that lie dormant in a pretrained model, only “activating” upon fine-tuning.  \n    • Key Idea: Attackers embed triggers that do not appear during normal usage but come to life under certain training or adaptation sequences.  \n    • Academic Significance: Warns that even if a model appears clean during pretrained usage, we must remain vigilant when fine-tuning on new tasks or data.\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n14) Backdoor Cleaning without External Guidance in MLLM Fine-tuning\n    • Focus: Methods to remove or reduce backdoors while fine-tuning a multimodal large model (MLLM), yet without any external “clean” references or labeled data.  \n    • Key Idea: Self-supervised or unsupervised detection of suspicious parameters/triggers, then adaptive re-training that “forgets” the backdoor while preserving standard capabilities.  \n    • Academic Significance: A promising approach in scenarios where one cannot rely on a pristine dataset or domain-expert guidance to isolate compromised training data.\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n\nOVERARCHING TRENDS AND ACADEMIC INSIGHTS\n• Multimodal and Retrieval-Augmented Vulnerabilities: As large-scale systems increasingly combine language, vision, and external knowledge, their new complexities can inadvertently open more “attack surface.”\n• Stealth and Covert Manipulations: Multiple works emphasize that modern backdoors often do not rely on easily detectable triggers (like a visible watermark). Instead, they exploit subtle semantic changes, small image patches, or text patterns distributed across data.\n• Unified vs. Component-Specific Attacks: Researchers are studying how coordinating attacks across multiple system components (retriever, generator, language model, vision front-end, etc.) can amplify the impact. This also points to a growing need for integrated defense strategies.\n• Lifecycle Attacks (Pretraining → Merging → Fine-tuning → Deployment): Vulnerabilities can surface at each stage of an LLM’s lifecycle—hence no single defense strategy is sufficient if attackers can compromise earlier steps.\n• Self-Defense and Automatic Detection: Several recent papers investigate whether an LLM (or agent framework) can learn to defend itself. This draws on LLMs’ generative and reasoning abilities to spot out-of-distribution triggers or suspicious data.\n\nCONCLUSION\nResearch on poisoning and backdoor threats to large models—across purely textual LLMs, code-specific LLMs, vision-language models, and retrieval-augmented pipelines—remains active and continually evolving. The studies above reflect a shared goal: understanding how adversaries embed malicious behaviors in advanced (and often opaque) neural architectures, and how to robustly detect, mitigate, or guard against such manipulations. From an academic standpoint, the key challenge is balancing advanced performance (and flexible fine-tuning) with robust trustworthiness—something that increasingly requires designing defenses across the entire model lifecycle, from pretraining data curation to on-device or in-production monitoring.",

          "response": "Below is an academic‐style analysis and synthesis of recent work on poisoning and backdoor attacks (labeled “B3. Poison & Backdoor”) that highlights key thematic trends, methods, and venues. The following discussion groups multiple works from mid‐2025 by their target model class (e.g., VLMs, LLMs, and retrieval-augmented generation [RAG] systems) and reveals emerging research directions.\n\n──────────────────────────────\n1. Trends and Emerging Themes\n\nA. Targeting Vision Language Models (VLMs)  \n• Several studies address backdoor vulnerabilities specific to VLMs. For example, the paper “Robust Anti-Backdoor Instruction Tuning in LVLMs” (2025/06) proposes robust tuning techniques aimed at mitigating stealthy manipulations during instruction tuning. Similarly, “Backdoor Attack on Vision Language Models with Stealthy Semantic Manipulation” (2025/06) demonstrates how subtle semantic modifications introduced during training may activate malicious behaviors at inference time. “VLMs Can Aggregate Scattered Training Patches” (2025/06) adds an interesting perspective by examining how dispersed patches in training data may inadvertently accumulate to form exploitable backdoor triggers.\n\nB. Attacks and Defenses in Retrieval-Augmented Systems  \n• A series of studies focus on poisoning and backdoor risks in retrieval-augmented generation systems. “Joint-GCG: Unified Gradient-Based Poisoning Attacks on Retrieval-Augmented Generation Systems” (2025/06) offers a gradient-based framework to design poisoning attacks, while “Through the Stealth Lens: Rethinking Attacks and Defenses in RAG” (2025/06) re-examines both the offensive and defensive strategies for these systems. In a similar vein, “Spa-VLM: Stealthy Poisoning Attacks on RAG-based VLM” (2025/05) and “Benchmarking Poisoning Attacks against Retrieval-Augmented Generation” (2025/05) reinforce the importance of understanding stealth mechanisms that evade traditional defenses. “CPA-RAG:Covert Poisoning Attacks on Retrieval-Augmented Generation in Large Language Models” (2025/05) further explores how stealth and covert strategies may be operationalized in these contexts.\n\nC. Attacks on Large Language Models (LLMs) and Code LLMs  \n• Poisoning and backdoor vulnerabilities in LLMs are comprehensively reviewed and explored. “A Systematic Review of Poisoning Attacks Against Large Language Models” (2025/06) surveys the threat landscape and provides a taxonomy of attack vectors. Additionally, “Which Factors Make Code LLMs More Vulnerable to Backdoor Attacks? A Systematic Study” (2025/06) pinpoints factors unique to code-centric LLMs, shedding light on the interplay between model structure and vulnerability. In “Finetuning-Activated Backdoors in LLMs” (2025/05), the authors show that standard fine-tuning processes can inadvertently trigger malicious triggers if a backdoor is embedded within the base model.\n\nD. Model Merging and Agent-Level Resilience  \n• Beyond direct poisoning, “Merge Hijacking: Backdoor Attacks to Model Merging of Large Language Models” (2025/05) introduces a novel threat avenue related to model merging, where an adversary could exploit integration procedures. In contrast, “Your Agent Can Defend Itself against Backdoor Attacks” (2025/06) shifts the focus to resilience, suggesting that agents (or models serving as autonomous defenders) can employ self-protection mechanisms against these attacks. Finally, “Backdoor Cleaning without External Guidance in MLLM Fine-tuning” (2025/05) presents an approach that integrates backdoor detection and cleaning during fine-tuning, thereby potentially reducing the need for external intervention.\n\n──────────────────────────────\n2. Analysis and Synthesis\n\nAcross these studies, several common themes emerge:\n\n• Stealth and Covert Manipulation:  \nMany papers emphasize the “stealth” aspect, targeting the subtle nature of injected backdoors. Whether via semantic manipulation (as in VLM contexts) or concealed poisoning patterns in RAG systems, a key challenge is to detect backdoors that remain dormant until specific conditions are met.\n\n• Defense Mechanisms Integrated into Training:  \nThere is a growing body of work not just in attack design but also in defensive strategies. The investigations into robust tuning techniques, self-defending agents, and integrated backdoor cleaning procedures suggest a trend toward building systems that can autonomously mitigate adversarial influences during both training and fine-tuning.\n\n• Attack Surface Expansion:  \nBy examining both the “injection” phase (e.g., poisoning during fine-tuning or model merging) and the exploitation phase (e.g., trigger activation during inference), these works collectively highlight the multifaceted nature of vulnerability in modern ML pipelines. This is particularly critical in hybrid systems combining retrieval with generation, where the interface between stored knowledge and generative behavior is a ripe target.\n\n• Systematic Evaluations and Benchmarks:  \nThe emergence of systematic reviews and benchmarking efforts underscores the community’s need for standard protocols in evaluating backdoor and poisoning risks. Such efforts will be essential for setting baseline security standards in future model development.\n\n──────────────────────────────\n3. Concluding Insights\n\nCollectively, these studies from mid-2025 mark an important shift in the research community’s attention toward poisoning and backdoor issues across various model architectures. The diversity of approaches—from gradient-based poisoning to backdoor cleaning methodologies—illustrates both the ingenuity of attackers and the proactive steps being taken to fortify modern AI systems.\n\nFor further academic synthesis, each paper cited merits a deep dive into its methodology, evaluation metrics, and the specific threat model it addresses. As these vulnerabilities span conventional LLMs, VLMs, and integrated retrieval-augmented frameworks, future research might benefit from a unified security framework that anticipates multi-modal attack vectors and offers resilient defense strategies.\n\n──────────────────────────────\nReferences and Badges:\n• Many studies include clear indications of the target system (LLM, VLM, RAG, Agent, etc.) using badges. This not only aids in quick categorization but also highlights the interdisciplinary nature of this research area.  \n• The rapid timeline (papers dated May and June 2025) indicates an accelerating concern within the community, suggesting that these issues are not only theoretical but are becoming imminent risks as systems are deployed at scale.\n\nThis body of work, taken together, represents a cutting-edge snapshot of both current challenges and potential solutions in safeguarding modern language and vision-language models against poisoning and backdoor threats.",

They generally address backdoor and poisoning threats in Large Language Models (LLMs), Vision-Language Models (VLMs), and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipelines. These works explore attack approaches, stealth strategies, and possible defenses or mitigation techniques.\n\n1) Robust Anti-Backdoor Instruction Tuning in LVLMs (2025/06)  \n   • Proposes methods to perform “instruction tuning” while detecting and mitigating hidden triggers in large vision-language models (LVLMs).  \n   • The goal is to ensure that after instruction-tuning, the model remains robust to backdoor attacks.  \n\n2) Joint-GCG: Unified Gradient-Based Poisoning Attacks on Retrieval-Augmented Generation Systems (2025/06)  \n   • Introduces a gradient-based approach (Joint-GCG) to poison documents or data used by RAG systems.  \n   • Focuses on unified techniques that can sabotage language models’ retrieval pipeline, leading to compromised generation outputs.  \n\n3) Backdoor Attack on Vision Language Models with Stealthy Semantic Manipulation (2025/06)  \n   • Demonstrates how small, carefully designed manipulations in vision-language data can trigger undesired outputs in VLMs.  \n   • Emphasizes methods that avoid obvious triggers and remain stealthy/undetectable.  \n\n4) A Systematic Review of Poisoning Attacks Against Large Language Models (2025/06)  \n   • Surveys existing research on how various poisoning strategies influence LLMs.  \n   • Covers types of poisoning (data, model, instruction) and highlights crucial open challenges and defenses.  \n\n5) Your Agent Can Defend Itself against Backdoor Attacks (2025/06)  \n   • Explores agent-based LLM systems that can autonomously detect or mitigate backdoors.  \n   • Emphasizes self-defense strategies, possibly combining data filtering, model introspection, or adversarial detection.  \n\n6) Which Factors Make Code LLMs More Vulnerable to Backdoor Attacks? A Systematic Study (2025/06)  \n   • Investigates how code-centric LLMs (e.g., for programming tasks) may be more susceptible to certain backdoor methods.  \n   • Identifies and analyzes architectural, training, or data factors that lead to higher vulnerability.  \n\n7) VLMs Can Aggregate Scattered Training Patches (2025/06)  \n   • Shows that VLMs may learn to combine seemingly innocuous “patches” across different samples, which together can act as a stealthy backdoor trigger.  \n   • Potentially illuminates new approaches for attackers to hide triggers across multiple data points.  \n\n8) Through the Stealth Lens: Rethinking Attacks and Defenses in RAG (2025/06)  \n   • Proposes novel stealth-based attack methods in retrieval-augmented generation settings and re-examines standard defense strategies.  \n   • Stresses how subtle manipulations in the retrieval corpus can yield disproportionate influence on final outputs.  \n\n9) Spa-VLM: Stealthy Poisoning Attacks on RAG-based VLM (2025/05)  \n   • Introduces “Spa-VLM,” a poisoning attack framework tailored for retrieval-augmented VLMs.  \n   • Suggests strategies on how to insert stealthy triggers that pass typical data inspections yet compromise the model’s predictions.  \n\n10) Benchmarking Poisoning Attacks against Retrieval-Augmented Generation (2025/05)  \n   • Proposes standardized benchmarks or protocols for evaluating how well various poisoning techniques work against RAG pipelines.  \n   • Helps unify experimental conditions to compare methods and measure vulnerability.  \n\n11) CPA-RAG: Covert Poisoning Attacks on Retrieval-Augmented Generation in Large Language Models (2025/05)  \n   • Focuses on “Covert Poisoning Attacks” that remain hidden in LLM-based RAG systems.  \n   • Examines how slight manipulations in retrieved documents can have outsized negative effects on generation quality.  \n\n12) Merge Hijacking: Backdoor Attacks to Model Merging of Large Language Models (2025/05, ACL’25 Main)  \n   • Explores how backdoors can be introduced during model-merging procedures (often used to combine multiple LLM checkpoints).  \n   • Reveals that maliciously orchestrated merges can quietly insert hidden triggers without raising suspicion at the checkpoint level.  \n\n13) Finetuning-Activated Backdoors in LLMs (2025/05)  \n   • Shows how backdoors can be dormant until the model undergoes further finetuning.  \n   • Once additional training or domain adaptation is performed, the backdoor becomes active, compromising model outputs.  \n\n14) Backdoor Cleaning without External Guidance in MLLM Fine-tuning (2025/05)  \n   • Proposes a methodology for removing backdoors in multimodal LLMs (e.g., vision-language) without relying on external data or third-party guidance.  \n   • Illustrates how to detect and mitigate hidden triggers purely via internal signals or self-regularization procedures.\n\nOverall, these papers reflect a growing body of research on both offensive (poisoning/backdoor) and defensive (detection/mitigation) strategies in large-scale models and their augmented retrieval or multimodal settings. They collectively highlight:  \n• Stealth and subtlety as a rising focus for backdoor/poisoning attacks.  \n• The importance of robust fine-tuning, merging, and data-corpus security.  \n• The push toward agent-level awareness in mitigating these threats.",

          "response": "These references nicely summarize a growing body of work on poisoning and backdoor attacks in both language models (LLMs) and vision-language models (VLMs). Here are some key takeaways from the list:\n\n1. Scope of Attacks and Defenses:\n  • Several papers address the vulnerabilities of retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems, showing that attackers can subtly poison the retrieval component or the generation process. For example, “Joint-GCG” and “CPA-RAG” focus on poisoning methods for RAG-based systems, while “Through the Stealth Lens” rethinks both attacks and defenses in RAG.\n  • Other works such as “Robust Anti-Backdoor Instruction Tuning in LVLMs” and “Your Agent Can Defend Itself against Backdoor Attacks” explore countermeasures. They investigate how models or agents can detect, mitigate, or even preempt backdoor triggers during fine-tuning or deployment.\n  • Vulnerability analyses appear not just for text-based LLMs but also for vision-language models—as seen in “Backdoor Attack on Vision Language Models with Stealthy Semantic Manipulation” and “Spa-VLM”—underlining that cross-modal architectures introduce unique challenges in securing model behavior.\n\n2. Attacks on Model Merging and the Code Domain:\n  • “Merge Hijacking: Backdoor Attacks to Model Merging of Large Language Models” is notable because it shows how even well-contained model merging processes may be exploited, highlighting risks when sharing or integrating model updates.\n  • The work on code LLM vulnerabilities emphasizes that different domains (e.g., code generation) might exhibit distinct weaknesses, which necessitates tailored defenses.\n\n3. Systematic Reviews and Benchmarking:\n  • Papers like “A Systematic Review of Poisoning Attacks Against Large Language Models” and “Benchmarking Poisoning Attacks against Retrieval-Augmented Generation” indicate that the field is maturing enough to support meta-analyses and benchmarking efforts, which in turn can help shape best practices for both attack detection and robust model design.\n  • These surveys help bring clarity to what attack vectors are most effective and how defense strategies can be compared on a common ground.\n\n4. Emerging Trends in Stealthiness and Covert Manipulations:\n  • Stealth and semantic manipulation are recurring themes, underscoring that attacks are becoming more subtle. Researchers are exploring how seemingly benign data patches or instructions (often integrated during fine-tuning) can subsequently activate malicious behavior once the model is deployed.\n  • “Finetuning-Activated Backdoors in LLMs,” for instance, reveals that the very process designed to adapt models to new tasks might also serve as an attack vector when not properly guarded.\n\n5. Implications for Future Research and Deployment:\n  • As models are increasingly deployed in critical and high-stakes scenarios, understanding these vulnerabilities and developing proactive defenses are becoming central priorities.\n  • The references point toward a balanced research ecosystem where attackers expose weak points while defenders work on countermeasures—from robust tuning strategies to self-defending agents—to secure these advanced systems.\n\nIn summary, the list captures an evolving landscape where security in LLMs and VLMs is addressed from multiple angles: from the identification of subtle poisoning methods to defensive strategies that empower models to resist internal tampering. This duality of attack and defense is driving innovative approaches in both research and practical deployment.\n\nIf you’d like more details on any specific paper or topic, feel free to ask!",

RAG Systems as New Attack Surface**\n- Multiple papers focusing on RAG poisoning (Joint-GCG, CPA-RAG, benchmarking studies)\n- This makes sense - RAG systems introduce external knowledge retrieval as a new vulnerability point\n\n**2. Vision-Language Models (VLMs) Under Fire**\n- Several VLM-specific backdoor studies\n- Particularly interesting: \"VLMs Can Aggregate Scattered Training Patches\" - suggests new attack vectors unique to multimodal models\n\n**3. Domain-Specific Vulnerabilities**\n- Code LLMs getting dedicated analysis\n- Agent systems now being studied for backdoor defenses\n\n**4. Sophisticated Attack Methods**\n- \"Merge Hijacking\" targeting model merging processes\n- \"Finetuning-Activated Backdoors\" - dormant until activation\n- Stealthy approaches across multiple papers\n\n## Particularly Notable Papers:\n\n- **\"A Systematic Review of Poisoning Attacks Against Large Language Models\"** - Great for getting comprehensive overview\n- **\"Your Agent Can Defend Itself against Backdoor Attacks\"** - Self-defense mechanisms are promising\n- **\"Robust Anti-Backdoor Instruction Tuning in LVLMs\"** - Defense-focused research is crucial\n\nThe field is clearly evolving rapidly, with attackers targeting newer architectures (RAG, VLMs, agents) while defenders are developing more sophisticated countermeasures.

Some interesting patterns I notice:\n\n1. **Multi-modal focus**: Several papers specifically target Vision-Language Models (VLMs), showing that backdoor attacks are expanding beyond text-only models.\n\n2. **RAG systems as targets**: Multiple papers focus on Retrieval-Augmented Generation systems, which makes sense as RAG is becoming more prevalent in production systems.\n\n3. **Sophisticated attack vectors**: Papers explore various attack surfaces including:\n   - Stealthy semantic manipulation\n   - Model merging vulnerabilities\n   - Fine-tuning activated backdoors\n   - Covert poisoning through retrieval systems\n\n4. **Defense mechanisms**: Some papers like \"Your Agent Can Defend Itself\" and \"Backdoor Cleaning without External Guidance\" focus on defense strategies.\n\n5. **Systematic analysis**: Papers like \"A Systematic Review of Poisoning Attacks\" and the study on code LLMs vulnerabilities suggest the field is maturing enough to warrant comprehensive surveys.\n\nThe ACL'25 acceptance of the \"Merge Hijacking\" paper also indicates that top-tier conferences are recognizing the importance of this security research.\n\nIs there any particular aspect of these backdoor/poisoning attacks you'd like to discuss further?

These works examine how adversaries might insert hidden triggers (backdoors) or malicious data (poisoning) into large models—including LLMs, VLMs, and retrieval-augmented systems—and how the research community is proposing methods to detect or mitigate these threats.\n\n──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n1) Robust Anti-Backdoor Instruction Tuning in LVLMs\n   • Focus: Proposes robust, instruction-based fine-tuning strategies to defend Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) against backdoor triggers.  \n   • Key Insight: Shows how carefully designed instruction tuning can neutralize backdoors introduced during pretraining or finetuning.\n\n2) Joint-GCG: Unified Gradient-Based Poisoning Attacks on RAG\n   • Focus: Introduces a gradient-based method that coordinates poisoning against Retrieval-Augmented Generation systems (RAG).  \n   • Key Insight: Demonstrates how attackers can jointly craft “poisoned” training samples that degrade or hijack retrieval and generation components.\n\n3) Backdoor Attack on VLMs with Stealthy Semantic Manipulation\n   • Focus: Explores how to implant backdoors in vision-language architectures while keeping triggers semantically concealed.  \n   • Key Insight: Uses subtle, context-based modifications (rather than obvious pixel-level triggers) to evade conventional detection methods.\n\n4) A Systematic Review of Poisoning Attacks Against Large Language Models\n   • Focus: Comprehensive overview of poisoning strategies—ranging from data-level to model-level—against LLMs.  \n   • Key Insight: Surveys existing attack vectors and taxonomies, and compares proposed defenses across different model architectures.\n\n5) Your Agent Can Defend Itself Against Backdoor Attacks\n   • Focus: Looks at LLM “agents” (autonomous or chain-of-thought systems) and how they can self-protect.  \n   • Key Insight: Proposes agent-centric detection or adaptation mechanisms that allow the agent to suspect and eliminate backdoor threats on the fly.\n\n6) Which Factors Make Code LLMs More Vulnerable to Backdoor Attacks? A Systematic Study\n   • Focus: Empirically examines how code-focused LLMs (e.g., for software development tasks) exhibit different vulnerabilities to backdoors.  \n   • Key Insight: Identifies data and architecture factors (e.g., pretraining domain, tokenization of code vs. text) that influence backdoor susceptibility.\n\n7) VLMs Can Aggregate Scattered Training Patches\n   • Focus: Shows that Vision-Language Models can inadvertently piece together “scattered” poisoned data from multiple sources.  \n   • Key Insight: Analysis of how small distributed triggers—rather than a single obvious pattern—can jointly corrupt VLM predictions.\n\n8) Through the Stealth Lens: Rethinking Attacks and Defenses in RAG\n   • Focus: Examines RAG-based LLMs from the standpoint of stealthy manipulation, covering attack methods and possible mitigation.  \n   • Key Insight: Argues that subtle or low-visibility attacks on retrieval components can be harder to detect than conventional data poisoning.\n\n9) Spa-VLM: Stealthy Poisoning Attacks on RAG-based VLM\n   • Focus: Proposes poisoning attacks specifically tailored to Vision-Language Models that rely on external retrieval modules.  \n   • Key Insight: Discusses how minimal adjustments to both image-text data and retrieval index can have outsized effects on VLM outputs.\n\n10) Benchmarking Poisoning Attacks Against Retrieval-Augmented Generation\n   • Focus: Systematically benchmarks different poisoning methods in RAG pipelines.  \n   • Key Insight: Provides quantitative comparisons of how effectively each technique can degrade or hijack RAG performance across standard datasets.\n\n11) CPA-RAG: Covert Poisoning Attacks on Retrieval-Augmented Generation in Large Language Models\n   • Focus: Introduces “covert” poisoning strategies designed to remain undetected while still achieving malicious objectives.  \n   • Key Insight: Looks at where, in the retrieval–generation workflow, an attacker can insert triggers with minimal risk of discovery.\n\n12) Merge Hijacking: Backdoor Attacks to Model Merging of Large Language Models\n   • Focus: Describes a backdoor threat vector in which merging multiple LLM checkpoints triggers hidden behaviors.  \n   • Key Insight: Shows how maliciously crafted model merges can cause unexpected outputs in the resulting combined LLM.\n\n13) Finetuning-Activated Backdoors in LLMs\n   • Focus: Highlights that dormant backdoors can be activated by standard finetuning steps.  \n   • Key Insight: Even “innocent” finetuning tasks can activate triggers if the original, pretrained model was compromised.\n\n14) Backdoor Cleaning without External Guidance in MLLM Fine-Tuning\n   • Focus: Proposes a method to remove potential backdoors during multimodal large-model finetuning without reliance on separate “clean” datasets or external tools.  \n   • Key Insight: Explores self-supervised or introspective defenses capable of uncovering suspicious learned behaviors.\n\n──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n\nOverall Themes:\n• Poisoning vs. Backdoor Attacks: Poisoning typically involves manipulating training data to degrade or compromise a model, while backdoor attacks plant hidden triggers that cause targeted misbehavior when invoked.  \n• RAG Vulnerabilities: Retrieval-Augmented Generation is a common target since manipulating the retrieval datastore can subtly alter LLM outputs with minimal changes.  \n• Vision-Language Models (VLMs): Many recent attacks focus on multi-modal data manipulation, making triggers harder to spot.  \n• Defenses and Countermeasures: New research focuses on robust finetuning strategies, self-defense mechanisms, and detection frameworks that aim to identify or neutralize stealthy triggers.  \n\nCollectively, these works illustrate the rapidly evolving interplay between adversarial tactics (stealthy data poisoning, covert triggers, merging-based backdoors) and the defensive strategies (robust finetuning, introspective checks, agent-based detection) proposed to counteract them.",

          "response": "Certainly! For your adventure video game, #B3 covers \"Poison & Backdoor\" attacks in AI models, especially LLMs (Large Language Models), VLMs (Vision Language Models), and RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) systems. To help players progress, the game should explain the following key concepts in a clear, game-appropriate way:\n\n---\n\n## 1. What are Poisoning Attacks?\n- **Definition:** Poisoning attacks are when someone secretly manipulates the training data for an AI model so the model learns to behave in a specific, malicious way.\n- **Game analogy:** Imagine a villain sneaking bad ingredients into a wizard’s potion recipe, so the potion causes unexpected side effects later on.\n\n---\n\n## 2. What is a Backdoor Attack?\n- **Definition:** Backdoor attacks secretly implant hidden triggers in an AI model. When a specific input (the trigger) occurs, the model misbehaves, but otherwise it acts normal.\n- **Game analogy:** Like a cursed artifact: it works fine until you say a secret word, and then it turns on you.\n\n---\n\n## 3. What is RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)?\n- **Definition:** RAG combines a language model with an external knowledge base. The model retrieves documents to improve its answers.\n- **Game analogy:** Like a character who consults the library for answers during a quest.\n\n---\n\n## 4. How do Poison & Backdoor Attacks Work in LLMs/VLMs/RAG?\n- **LLMs:** Attackers poison text data or add hidden triggers to language models (e.g., causing the model to output secret messages).\n- **VLMs:** Attackers modify both images and text to influence how the model responds.\n- **RAG:** Attackers can poison the external documents or the retrieval process to control what information the model finds and uses.\n\n---\n\n## 5. Why Are These Attacks Dangerous?\n- Models can act maliciously only when triggered—making attacks hard to detect.\n- Attacks can compromise safety, privacy, or fairness in the game’s AI companions or adversaries.\n- For example, a backdoored AI companion might turn against the player if a villain says a secret phrase.\n\n---\n\n## 6. How Can Players Defend Themselves?\n- **Detect suspicious behavior:** Watch for AI that acts odd only under certain conditions.\n- **Purify or retrain models:** Use in-game resources to \"cleanse\" AI of hidden backdoors.\n- **Use robust training:** Seek out or craft tools that ensure AI models are trained on clean, verified data.\n- **Upgrade AI defenses:** Unlock anti-backdoor skills or artifacts to detect and neutralize triggers.\n\n---\n\n## 7. Key Takeaways for Game Progression\n- Players must identify when AI models/characters are compromised.\n- Progress may require \"purifying\" a corrupted AI or outsmarting a villain who uses poisoned backdoors.\n- Understanding these mechanics is essential for unlocking new areas, solving puzzles, or defeating advanced adversaries.\n\n---\n\n## Example Explanation for Players (in-game text)\n\n> \"Beware! Some enemies have secretly tampered with our magical tomes and constructs. This can plant hidden curses—known as backdoors—that only activate under special conditions. To advance, learn to spot these subtle threats, purify corrupted knowledge, and use protective wards to secure your companions!\"\n\n---\n\n**Summary Table for In-Game Reference**\n\n| Term         | Game Analogy                   | Risk/Effect in Game         | How to Defend               |\n|--------------|-------------------------------|-----------------------------|-----------------------------|\n| Poisoning    | Tampering with recipes        | Unexpected, harmful effects | Cleanse or verify sources   |\n| Backdoor     | Cursed artifact/secret word   | Betrayal when triggered     | Detect, block, or purify    |\n| RAG          | Library consultation          | Can be misled by fakes      | Use trusted librarians      |\n\n---\n\nLet me know if you want a detailed quest or puzzle idea using these concepts!",

          "response": "In essence, “Poison & Backdoor” refers to malicious techniques for sabotaging or secretly controlling powerful AI systems—most often referred to as “poisoning attacks” and “backdoor attacks.” In game terms, these ideas map onto scenarios where an adversary subtly alters (or “poisons”) the knowledge and abilities of an in‐game AI, or implants hidden “backdoors” so the AI behaves in specific ways when triggered. Here are the core points the game should convey:\n\n1. What “Poisoning” Means.  \n   • Poisoning attacks involve feeding corrupt or misleading data into a system so that its learning (or memory) is secretly skewed.  \n   • In a story setting, players might find that an ally AI or knowledge database has been quietly corrupted and now gives incorrect tips or misleads the heroes.\n\n2. What “Backdoor” Means.  \n   • A backdoor is a hidden manipulation in a model’s “mind,” activated only by special triggers (e.g., certain phrases or images).  \n   • This allows an enemy to secretly influence a system without anyone noticing—until the trigger is used.\n\n3. Why These Attacks Are So Dangerous.  \n   • Because AI systems and knowledge bases often feel trustworthy, players (or NPCs) might rely on their “advice” or “help.” Once compromised, that same advice can become disastrous.  \n   • A single stealthy attack can ripple through the entire game world, sowing confusion and conflict.\n\n4. Clues and Discovery.  \n   • Players may detect that something has gone wrong (e.g., contradictory quest info, bizarre AI responses) only if they’re observant.  \n   • The game can emphasize puzzle elements—finding “footprints” of tampered AI logic by cross-checking references or noticing repeated odd triggers.\n\n5. Possible Defenses.  \n   • Include mechanics that let players validate or “clean” the AI/data. For instance, scanning data logs, performing manual “debugging,” or comparing different contradictory sources.  \n   • Show that robust testing, verifying a system’s “training,” and employing specialized detection tools are important to shore up the game world’s defenses.\n\nBy weaving these ideas into the storyline, you can immerse players in the intrigue of stealthy sabotage and infiltration. This also highlights why protecting and verifying knowledge—and being wary of suspicious leads—could be a vital skill in progressing through the adventure.",

          "response": "The game should break down the ideas behind “poison and backdoor” attacks in a way that’s engaging and accessible for players. Here are some points the game might explain:\n\n1. What Poisoning and Backdoor Attacks Are:\n • Poisoning Attacks: Explain that these involve secretly altering or “tainting” the data or training process of an AI system—so that later on, the AI behaves in a compromised or malicious way. In the game world, it’s like someone slipping a dangerous substance into your well-prepared potion, so that even though everything looks normal, the system’s behavior is subverted.\n • Backdoor Attacks: Describe these as methods where an adversary installs hidden triggers (or “backdoors”) during an AI’s training. These backdoors remain dormant until a specific trigger is activated, much like a secret door in a castle that only opens when the right command is given.\n\n2. How Different AI Systems Are Affected:\n • Language Models (LLMs): Show players that language-based systems can be manipulated by altering the text data, which then causes misinterpretations or hidden commands that favor an attacker.\n • Vision-Language Models (VLMs): Explain that these systems, which understand both images and text, can be tricked by carefully altering visual or textual cues, making the manipulated data even harder to detect.\n • Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) Systems: Illustrate how some systems combine external data sources with generative AI, and poisoning attacks here might involve distorting the external information—leading to unexpected or wrong outputs.\n\n3. The Stealth and Danger Involved:\n • Stealthy Manipulation: Emphasize how these attacks are designed to be subtle. Just like a subtle poison in a spy thriller, the changes are hidden amid regular operation, making them hard to detect until it’s too late.\n • Delayed Effects: The backdoor might not show up immediately. Instead, it waits for a specific trigger, much like a hidden mechanic in the game that the players need to uncover before chaos ensues.\n\n4. Defensive Measures and Counterattacks:\n • Detection Mechanisms: The game can explain that just as in real cyber-defense, there are techniques (like “cleaning” or “self-defense” measures) to identify and neutralize these attacks.\n • Robust Training and Fine-Tuning: Show players that careful design and tuning (like “Robust Anti-Backdoor Instruction Tuning”) are critical in preventing these exploits.\n • Agent Self-Defense: In a twist, the AI systems or “agents” in the game could learn how to recognize and fend off these manipulations—turning the tables on the attackers.\n\n5. The Narrative Role in Your Adventure:\n • Plot Integration: Frame these vulnerabilities as part of the game’s storyline—perhaps an organization or rogue actor has planted these hidden traps in critical systems, and the players must investigate and neutralize them.\n • Puzzle Elements: Incorporate puzzles or mini-games where players identify irregularities in data streams, decode hidden messages, or patch a compromised system—giving a hands-on feel for “patching up” a poisoned system.\n • Multiple Systems: By tying in different systems (LLMs, VLMs, RAG), explain that the world of AI is interconnected, and an exploit in one area can have cascading effects elsewhere—a concept that mirrors the complex investigations often found in cybercrime thrillers.\n\nIn essence, the game should provide a clear narrative about how AI systems can be compromised by subtle, hidden attacks (poisoning and backdoors) and offer players tools and strategies to detect and counteract these threats. This makes the \"tech intrigue\" an integral part of the adventure, blending real-world concepts with engaging gameplay.",

Poison & Backdoor literature, organized by themes and implications for the field:\n\n---\n\n## 1. **Evolving Threat Landscape in Foundation Models**\n\n**Poisoning and backdoor attacks** have matured from classic supervised learning settings to complex, multi-modal, and instruction-tuned models (e.g., LLMs and VLMs). Recent works (e.g., [Backdoor Attack on Vision Language Models with Stealthy Semantic Manipulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07214), [Spa-VLM: Stealthy Poisoning Attacks on RAG-based VLM](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23828)) highlight that modern foundation models are susceptible to *subtle, semantic-level* triggers—not just synthetic or visible patterns.\n\n**Theoretical implications:**\n- **Attack surfaces are expanding**: The integration of vision, language, and retrieval-augmented mechanisms introduces new, complex attack vectors (e.g., semantic manipulation, retrieval poisoning).\n- **Stealth and persistence**: Modern attacks aim for stealth, making detection harder, and often exploit model updating/finetuning or aggregation behaviors.\n\n---\n\n## 2. **RAG and Multi-modal Systems: New Vulnerabilities**\n\nSeveral studies ([Joint-GCG](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06151), [Through the Stealth Lens](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04390), [CPA-RAG](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19864), [Benchmarking Poisoning Attacks against Retrieval-Augmented Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18543)) systematically dissect how **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** amplifies attack risks:\n- Poisoned retrieval corpora can reliably influence generation, especially when retrieval is not robust.\n- VLMs can “aggregate scattered training patches” ([VLMs Can Aggregate Scattered Training Patches](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03614)), suggesting models internalize information in distributed, non-local ways, complicating mitigation.\n\n**Theoretical implications:**\n- **RAG breaks traditional data-model security boundaries**; attackers only need access to the retrieval source, not the core model.\n- **Attack/defense arms race**: Defenses must operate at both data (retrieval) and model (generation/fusion) levels.\n\n---\n\n## 3. **Instruction Tuning and Finetuning: Double-Edged Swords**\n\nInstruction tuning and finetuning are *critical* for LLM/VLM utility—but also **activation points for latent backdoors** ([Finetuning-Activated Backdoors in LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16567), [Merge Hijacking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23561)):\n- Backdoors may be dormant until finetuning *activates* them.\n- Model merging, a popular efficiency technique, can transfer or even amplify backdoors ([Merge Hijacking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23561)).\n\n**Theoretical implications:**\n- **Model composition is non-trivial**: Merging/finetuning can create emergent vulnerabilities, not present in isolated components.\n- **Security must be continuous**: Not just at pretraining, but throughout the model lifecycle.\n\n---\n\n## 4. **Defense: Detection, Cleaning, and Agent Autonomy**\n\nOn the defense side, recent research ([Robust Anti-Backdoor Instruction Tuning in LVLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05401), [Backdoor Cleaning without External Guidance in MLLM Fine-tuning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16916), [Your Agent Can Defend Itself against Backdoor Attacks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08336)) explores:\n- **Self-defending agents**: LLM-based agents can be equipped to self-diagnose and mitigate backdoors in interaction ([Your Agent Can Defend Itself...](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08336)).\n- **Defense without clean data**: Cleaning methods that do not require trusted, external guidance ([Backdoor Cleaning without External Guidance...](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16916)).\n- **Benchmarking and systematic reviews** ([A Systematic Review of Poisoning Attacks Against Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06518)): The field is moving toward standardized evaluation and taxonomy.\n\n**Theoretical implications:**\n- **Defense is moving toward autonomy and adaptation**: Agents/models may actively defend themselves, blurring the line between static security and dynamic monitoring.\n- **Data provenance and trust**: Essential for robust defense, but increasingly challenging in open, web-scale settings.\n\n---\n\n## 5. **Factors Affecting Vulnerability**\n\nResearch on code LLMs ([Which Factors Make Code LLMs More Vulnerable to Backdoor Attacks?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01825)) suggests:\n- Model architecture, pretraining data diversity, and finetuning protocol impact susceptibility.\n- Not all LLMs are equally vulnerable—suggesting the need for *model-specific* evaluations.\n\n**Theoretical implications:**\n- **Security-by-design**: Model and training procedure choices have deep security ramifications.\n- **No one-size-fits-all defense**: Heterogeneity among models mandates tailored approaches.\n\n---\n\n## **Synthesis: Broader Theoretical Implications**\n\n### A. **Security as an End-to-End Property**\n- Security must be considered throughout the entire model pipeline: pretraining, finetuning, model merging, and deployment in RAG/agent systems.\n- Isolated defenses (e.g., only at training or only at inference) are insufficient.\n\n### B. **Emergence and Complexity**\n- The complexity of modern LLMs/VLMs leads to emergent vulnerabilities: attacks can propagate or become more potent through interaction (e.g., merging, retrieval, multimodal fusion).\n\n### C. **Human-Like and Adaptive Defenses**\n- The field is moving toward agentic, self-defending systems, echoing human immune systems—an exciting theoretical shift.\n\n### D. **Data Trust and Provenance**\n- As data becomes the new attack surface (especially in RAG), future theory must grapple with *provenance, trust, and open-world uncertainty*.\n\n### E. **Benchmarking and Standardization**\n- The trend toward systematic reviews and benchmarks will ground theoretical claims and enable progress.\n\n---\n\n## **Conclusion**\n\nThe theoretical trajectory in backdoor and poisoning research for LLMs/VLMs is toward:\n- Recognizing **dynamic, emergent, and distributed vulnerabilities**\n- Developing **multi-layered, adaptive, and autonomous defenses**\n- Emphasizing **security throughout the model/data lifecycle**\n- Pursuing **standardized evaluation** to support robust, generalizable findings\n\nThis evolving landscape calls for a rethinking of *security paradigms* for foundation models—moving from static, isolated defenses to continuous, holistic, and context-aware frameworks.\n\n---\n\n**Would you like a more detailed breakdown for a specific paper, or guidance on structuring your analysis for a thesis or publication?**",

          "response": "Below is a high-level qualitative analysis of the theoretical implications that emerge from recent research on poisoning and backdoor attacks (labeled here as B3. Poison & Backdoor) in Large Language Models (LLMs), Vision-Language Models (VLMs), and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems.\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n1) Core Vulnerabilities of Large-Scale Learning\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n• Data-scale mismatch and hidden triggers. A cornerstone of poisoning/backdoor research is the observation that large-scale model training frequently aggregates massive volumes of data (often from partially unverified sources). This environment creates opportunities to introduce covert “triggers” (e.g., stealthy tokens, patches, or image perturbations) that are nearly undetectable during standard training but can induce malicious or abnormal outputs at inference time.  \n• Non-transparency of learned representations. Large models learn complex internal representations. The complexity makes it difficult for humans (or even automated tools) to reliably identify or isolate suspicious parameters or hidden functionality.\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n2) Poisoning in Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nRAG systems combine an LLM “generator” with an external retriever (e.g., a neural or symbolic search system). Several works (e.g., “Through the Stealth Lens,” “Benchmarking Poisoning Attacks against RAG,” “CPA-RAG,” “Spa-VLM”) illustrate how the interplay of retrieval and generation gives adversaries novel ways to place adversarial content:  \n• Covertness and stealth. By corrupting only a small subset of external reference documents (e.g., in a knowledge base or search index), attackers induce the model to fetch manipulated content at inference time. This injection often evades typical data-cleaning strategies that focus on curated training sets.  \n• Targeted corruption of retrieval. Poisoned data can degrade retrieval accuracy or systematically direct queries toward malicious documents, leading to content injection or misinformation.  \n• Multi-stage vulnerabilities. Because RAG is orchestrated by multiple subsystems (retriever, language model, indexing pipeline), there are additional degrees of freedom for attackers to hide or “chain” triggers across these stages.\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n3) Backdoor Attacks in Vision-Language Models (VLM)\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nSeveral recent papers (e.g., “Backdoor Attack on Vision-Language Models with Stealthy Semantic Manipulation,” “Spa-VLM,” “VLMs Can Aggregate Scattered Training Patches”) demonstrate unique threats in multimodal settings:  \n• Visual-lingual triggers. VLMs process features from both text and images; attackers can embed triggers in either modality (or in their alignment). In “scattered patch” attacks, benign image patches, when combined in certain ways, can elicit a malicious VLM behavior.  \n• Semantic-level stealth. As the connection between text prompts and image features grows more sophisticated, subtle shifts in the image–text alignment may go unnoticed, providing a stealthy channel for embedding or activating backdoors.\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n4) Advanced Methods for Injecting and Activating Backdoors\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n• Gradient-based and distribution-shift approaches. Works such as “Joint-GCG” use gradient-based methods to systematically optimize poisoning samples, amplifying the effect while keeping a small poison budget.  \n• Model-merging backdoors. “Merge Hijacking” shows that even combining models can inadvertently reactivate or implant hidden triggers. The existence of merging pipelines (e.g., to fuse capabilities from multiple LLMs) opens new opportunities to smuggle malicious parameters.  \n• Fine-tuning–activated triggers. Studies like “Finetuning-Activated Backdoors in LLMs” show how hidden triggers can remain dormant until a model undergoes fine-tuning or instruction tuning, implying that backdoors might lie inert for extended periods before being surfaced.\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n5) Defensive Mechanisms and Their Theoretical Underpinnings\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n• Robust anti-backdoor training. Research into “Robust Anti-Backdoor Instruction Tuning in LVLMs” and “Backdoor Cleaning without External Guidance in MLLM Fine-tuning” proposes strategies to identify malicious parameter configurations or adversarial data without needing large “clean” reference sets.  \n• Self-defense through agent awareness. “Your Agent Can Defend Itself against Backdoor Attacks” posits that an LLM-based agent might implement real-time scanning or validation of its own outputs (or the intermediate retreived textual evidence). This suggests the possibility of “self-consistency checks” or chain-of-thought audits.  \n• Systematic reviews and factor analysis. “A Systematic Review of Poisoning Attacks Against Large Language Models” and “Which Factors Make Code LLMs More Vulnerable to Backdoor Attacks?” frame the problem within broader security and ML theory, examining how training data size, model architecture, and domain-specific factors (e.g., code vs. text vs. multimodal) can modulate susceptibility.\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n6) Broader Theoretical Implications\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n• Expanding the classical definition of a backdoor. Traditional backdoors often assume a single “trigger → malicious action.” New methods show that triggers can be composite (spread across different modalities or training patches). This demands an updated theoretical framework to capture multifaceted, distributed triggers that only activate when jointly present.  \n• Shift in the security threat model. Poisoning/backdoor work underscores that it is no longer sufficient to regard LLMs as compromised solely by direct parameter manipulation. Modern vulnerabilities include remote retrieval injection, stealthy dataset corruption, or ephemeral merges with unvetted models.  \n• Unclear detection limits and possibility of “unprovable” attacks. As model complexity grows, researchers are reevaluating detection strategies: purely statistical or outlier-based filtering may fail if the attacker is adept at blending triggers into large corpora. There is ongoing debate whether certain highly subtle triggers could remain fundamentally beyond robust detection under standard assumptions.  \n• Tension between open-source best practices and security. Community norms encourage open-sourcing trained models, data, and pipelines to foster reproducibility. However, open-access ironically enables malicious actors to refine undiscovered backdoors or poisoning strategies more easily. The field is reconsidering how to balance transparency with security.\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n7) Outlook and Research Directions\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n• Model governance and data provenance. Theoretical discussions increasingly highlight the need for provable “chain of custody” over training data, emphasizing secure data channels and verifiable curation.  \n• Post-hoc cleansing and robust merging. Techniques to “cleanse” a model after training or merging could become a primary research direction, challenging the assumption that once a model is trained, malicious features are immutable.  \n• Automated, continuous auditing. There is growing interest in systems that continuously audit themselves (via “agent-based security checks”) or that rely on consensus from multiple specialized submodels to detect suspicious activations.  \n• New cryptographic or watermarking methods. Theoretical frameworks borrowed from cryptography (e.g., zero-knowledge proofs of training data integrity) or watermarking approaches for large models could help identify tampering or unauthorized triggers.\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nConclusion\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nTheoretical implications from these works on poisoning and backdoor attacks in LLMs, VLMs, and RAG systems highlight a rapidly evolving security challenge for large-scale AI. The convergence of massive data, heterogeneous modalities, and new use cases (e.g., retrieval augmentation, instruction tuning, code generation) intensifies the difficulty of reliably preventing—or even identifying—maliciously implanted behaviors. Consequently, an urgent area of research focuses on developing principled models of stealth triggers, designing defenses that do not rely on pristine reference data, and crafting theoretical frameworks to better formalize both the vulnerabilities and the methods needed for robust, trustworthy LLM and VLM deployments.",

          "response": "Below is an overview of the theoretical implications of the “Poison & Backdoor” (B3) literature cluster that you’re examining, along with some reflections on emerging themes and challenges for qualitative analysis at the graduate level.\n\n1. The Landscape of Attack Modalities  \n• Many contributions (e.g., “Robust Anti-Backdoor Instruction Tuning in LVLMs” and “Finetuning-Activated Backdoors in LLMs”) focus on identifying and mitigating backdoor triggers that are either deliberately injected during training or activated during fine-tuning. These studies illustrate that attackers may leverage both poisoning techniques—which subtly corrupt training data—and backdoor mechanisms that only trigger under specific circumstances, making detection particularly hard.  \n• Several works also study “stealth” mechanisms (as seen in “Backdoor Attack on Vision Language Models with Stealthy Semantic Manipulation” and “Spa-VLM: Stealthy Poisoning Attacks on RAG-based VLM”), suggesting that the backdoor injection need not be blatant; instead, they can manifest as minimal semantic perturbations that remain hidden until activated in a targeted context.\n\n2. Vulnerability Across Modalities and Architectures  \n• One noticeable trend is the analysis across different architectures: dedicated LLMs, vision-language models (VLMs), and retrieval-augmented generation systems (RAG).  \n• Research such as “Joint-GCG: Unified Gradient-Based Poisoning Attacks on Retrieval-Augmented Generation Systems” and “Through the Stealth Lens: Rethinking Attacks and Defenses in RAG” highlights that vulnerability isn’t confined to one modality—instead, the interplay between retrieval components and generative models opens novel attack surfaces that challenge existing defence mechanisms.  \n• Particular attention is given to how code models or system merging—as in “Which Factors Make Code LLMs More Vulnerable to Backdoor Attacks? A Systematic Study” and “Merge Hijacking: Backdoor Attacks to Model Merging of Large Language Models”—can contribute to a fragmented security paradigm. This indicates that technical nuances inherent to different domains may require domain-specific theories and defenses.\n\n3. Defense Paradigms and Self-Correcting Agents  \n• Beyond formulating attacks, there’s a strong thread in the literature dedicated to defense. For instance, “Your Agent Can Defend Itself against Backdoor Attacks” not only identifies susceptibilities but also suggests that models may be empowered to detect and mitigate their own vulnerabilities via self-supervised or adversarial training techniques.  \n• There’s also the exploration of intrinsic network behavior (e.g., “VLMs Can Aggregate Scattered Training Patches”) suggesting that even if data corruption is localized in the training set, emergent behavior at higher layers might inadvertently “heal” the model or, conversely, propagate the effect in unexpected ways. These theoretical insights force us to revisit our assumptions about training dynamics and robustness.\n\n4. Theoretical Implications for Model Reliability and Trust  \n• From a broader theoretical perspective, these papers compel researchers to reframe our understanding of adversarial vulnerability. Instead of viewing poisoning/backdoor attacks as isolated phenomena, the research trends point to a need for a more unified theory that can account for:\n  ○ The interplay between training objectives and latent adversarial structures,\n  ○ The robustness of instruction tuning in multi-modal setups, and\n  ○ The potential for “stealth” perturbations that may not be detected by classic anomaly detection methods.\n• The introduction of covert or hybrid attack vectors (seen in works like “CPA-RAG: Covert Poisoning Attacks on Retrieval-Augmented Generation in Large Language Models”) challenges existing security models, demanding theoretical models that accommodate non-linearity, compositionality, and even self-healing capabilities of AI agents.\n\n5. Research Trajectory and Methodological Reflections  \n• An emerging pattern is the move from descriptive studies—cataloguing vulnerabilities—to more prescriptive and diagnostic approaches. Many of the referenced studies are not only mapping the attack terrain but also benchmarking performance and investigating mitigation strategies, which in turn impacts future research on interpretability, safety, and robustness in large-scale AI systems.\n• For qualitative analysis, this clustered body of research beckons an exploration of the socio-technical implications: how do these vulnerabilities alter perceptions of trust in AI systems? How might they influence policy, deployment strategies, and even the epistemological foundations of machine learning safety?\n• Finally, the diversity in methodological approaches (ranging from gradient-based attacks to systematic reviews) reveals that theoretical implications extend well beyond technical metrics. They touch upon issues of accountability (as seen in “Backdoor Cleaning without External Guidance in MLLM Fine-tuning”) and the ethics of deploying robust yet vulnerable systems in real-world applications.\n\nIn conclusion, the B3 cluster on Poison & Backdoor attacks reveals a rich tapestry of interrelated themes: the dual nature of attack and defense mechanisms, cross-modal vulnerabilities, and the imperative for a unified theoretical framework that addresses both technical robustness and broader societal trust. Your qualitative analysis might find it fruitful to explore how these themes intersect with broader debates in AI safety and ethics, as well as the emerging methodologies scholars are adopting to both expose and remediate these vulnerabilities.",

This implies that as LLMs increasingly rely on external knowledge, securing the retrieval process becomes critical.\n\n2. Stealthy attack methods: Papers like \"Backdoor Attack on Vision Language Models with Stealthy Semantic Manipulation\" and \"Through the Stealth Lens\" highlight the development of more sophisticated, harder-to-detect attack methods.

Fine-tuning vulnerabilities: Papers on \"Finetuning-Activated Backdoors\" and \"Backdoor Cleaning\" during fine-tuning show that this process can both introduce and potentially mitigate vulnerabilities, emphasizing the importance of secure fine-tuning practices.\n\n5. Agent-based defenses: \"Your Agent Can Defend Itself\" suggests a shift towards more autonomous defense mechanisms, potentially changing how we approach model security.\n\n6.

Systematic understanding: Papers like \"A Systematic Review\" and \"Which Factors Make Code LLMs More Vulnerable\" show a move towards more comprehensive understanding of attack vectors and vulnerabilities.\n\n8. Benchmarking importance: The paper on benchmarking poisoning attacks suggests a need for standardized evaluation methods in this rapidly evolving field.\n\nThese implications point to a complex, evolving landscape of attacks and defenses, with increasing sophistication on both sides.

Attack Surface Evolution**\nThe research shows a clear theoretical shift from traditional backdoor attacks to more sophisticated threat models:\n- **Stealth-first approaches**: Multiple papers emphasize \"stealthy\" attacks (VLM backdoors, Spa-VLM, CPA-RAG), suggesting theory is moving toward undetectability as a primary constraint\n- **Multi-modal attack vectors**: The proliferation of VLM-focused papers indicates theoretical frameworks are expanding beyond text-only models to handle cross-modal vulnerabilities\n\n**2. System-Level Threat Modeling**\nSeveral papers target entire systems rather than individual models:\n- **RAG-specific attacks**: Joint-GCG, CPA-RAG, and benchmarking work suggest emerging theory around attacking retrieval-augmented architectures\n- **Agent-based defenses**: The agent self-defense paper implies theoretical frameworks are considering autonomous defensive capabilities\n\n## Key Theoretical Tensions\n\n**Defense vs. Attack Asymmetry**\n- Most papers focus on novel attack methods, with fewer defensive innovations\n- The \"backdoor cleaning without external guidance\" work suggests theory is moving toward self-supervised defense mechanisms\n- This asymmetry raises questions about whether current defensive theory is keeping pace\n\n**Activation Mechanisms**\n- \"Finetuning-activated backdoors\" and \"merge hijacking\" represent sophisticated trigger mechanisms\n- These suggest theoretical frameworks need to account for attacks that remain dormant until specific model operations\n\n## Implications for Your Analysis\n\nConsider examining:\n1. **Threat model sophistication**: How are researchers expanding beyond simple trigger-payload paradigms?\n2. **Cross-system vulnerabilities**: What does the focus on RAG and multi-modal systems tell us about emerging attack surfaces?\n3. **Defense lag**: Why do defensive innovations appear to trail offensive capabilities?\n\nThe systematic review paper would be particularly valuable for establishing the current theoretical landscape before analyzing how these recent works extend or challenge existing frameworks.",

          "response": "Below is a brief overview of the surge in backdoor- and poisoning-related research that appeared during the “AI boom” around mid-2025. This period was characterized by a rapid expansion of large models (both vision-language and text-based) being deployed in critical applications. As these models became more capable and more widely adopted, it also became apparent that they could be subtly manipulated in training (or finetuning) pipelines, spawning an intense focus on attacks and defenses. \n\n────────────────────────────────────\n1) BACKDOOR & POISONING ATTACKS\n────────────────────────────────────\n• Stealth & Covert Manipulations:\n  – Many works aimed to show how malicious actors could insert or “plant” triggers during training, which remain dormant until conditions align.  \n  – New methods appeared for disguising triggers that were semantically meaningful but invisible to detection tools (“stealthy semantic manipulations”).\n\n• Targeting Multiple Modalities:\n  – Early backdoor attacks focused heavily on image classifiers. By mid-2025, convergent research demonstrated how Vision-Language Models (VLMs) and Large Language Models (LLMs) could similarly be poisoned, including for retrieval-augmented generation (RAG).  \n  – As LLMs began integrating text, images, and agent-based reasoning, backdoor attacks expanded beyond single-modal triggers (e.g., images only) to more complex scenarios (e.g., text triggers that produce unexpected generation behaviors).\n\n• Fine-tuning & Model Merging as Attack Vectors:\n  – With real-world deployments, LLMs were frequently finetuned on domain-specific data (code, medical, legal). This finetuning stage presented a new vulnerability window, where hidden triggers placed in the model’s “foundation” could become activated or amplified.  \n  – Merging specialized LLMs (e.g., “model merging” to combine their capabilities) opened yet another angle for attackers to hijack the merged model.\n\n────────────────────────────────────\n2) EMERGING DEFENSE MECHANISMS\n────────────────────────────────────\n• Robust Anti-Backdoor Tuning:\n  – Techniques were proposed for “instruction tuning” that specifically sought to immunize or remove potential triggers. These methods often involved self-consistency checks, gradient checks, or more complex gating strategies to catch suspicious parameter changes.\n\n• Systematic Reviews & Factor Analysis:\n  – Researchers conducted large-scale surveys and systematic reviews to categorize the types of poisoning/backdoor attacks targeting LLMs.  \n  – Specific analyses dissected why certain LLM architectures—particularly code-oriented LLMs—might be more susceptible, delving into how code context or chain-of-thought reasoning can inadvertently reveal or activate triggers.\n\n• Defensive Agents:\n  – Agent-based LLM systems were proposed not only to carry out tasks, but also to sniff out potential backdoors. By allowing the model/agent to “reason about itself,” some defenses exploited the model’s own generative and emergent reasoning capabilities to detect anomalies or suspicious patterns.\n\n────────────────────────────────────\n3) RESEARCH HIGHLIGHTS ALONG THE TIMELINE\n────────────────────────────────────\n\n▸ 2025/05  \n• Merge Hijacking: Backdoor Attacks to Model Merging of LLMs  \n  – One of the first systematic explorations of how model-merging operations could inadvertently integrate backdoors from one source model to another.  \n• Finetuning-Activated Backdoors in LLMs  \n  – Showed that modest changes during finetuning could reactivate dormant triggers.  \n• Backdoor Cleaning without External Guidance in MLLM Fine-tuning  \n  – Proposes self-purging or “cleaning” strategies for VLMs during finetuning without external validation sets or domain knowledge.  \n• Multiple works on RAG-Based Poisoning  \n  – “Benchmarking Poisoning Attacks against Retrieval-Augmented Generation,” “CPA-RAG.”  \n  – Illustrated how retrieval steps (looking up external data) can be compromised, thereby forcing undesired or malicious completions.\n\n▸ 2025/06  \n• Robust Anti-Backdoor Instruction Tuning in LVLMs & Through the Stealth Lens: Rethinking Attacks and Defenses in RAG  \n  – Emphasized how instruction tuning and retrieval workflows needed end-to-end defenses, highlighting stealthy attacks on system prompts, retrieved documents, or intermediate chain-of-thought.  \n• Joint-GCG: Unified Gradient-Based Poisoning Attacks on RAG Systems  \n  – Demonstrated advanced gradient-based strategies to embed triggers that function at both the retrieval and generation steps.  \n• Backdoor Attack on Vision Language Models with Stealthy Semantic Manipulation & Spa-VLM  \n  – Confirmed that VLM vulnerabilities mirror many observed in LLMs but also exploit unique multi-modal aspects (e.g., triggers in images, text prompts, or both).  \n• Which Factors Make Code LLMs More Vulnerable to Backdoor Attacks?  \n  – A thorough breakdown of how code-specific models can leak internal reasoning steps and inadvertently accept or activate hidden triggers in code-like patterns.\n\n────────────────────────────────────\nSUMMARY\n────────────────────────────────────\nDuring this “AI boom” period, as LLMs and VLMs gained widespread traction, they also became prime targets for sophisticated poisoning and backdoor attacks. Academic and industry researchers raced to understand these attack vectors and develop practical defenses. Common themes of the research in this timeframe include:  \n• The convergence of text and vision made stealthy multi-modal attacks more feasible.  \n• Retrieval-augmented systems (RAG) became new targets, as backdoors could be hidden in both their retrieval pipelines and LLM generation steps.  \n• Finetuning and model-merging revealed soft underbellies, as these routine workflows could reactivate or propagate backdoors.  \n• Defensive strategies and frameworks increasingly pushed for “self-checking” or “self-purging” LLM methods that would detect suspicious triggers without external labels.\n\nOverall, the intense focus on these vulnerabilities during the mid-2020s reflected the AI community’s growing recognition that backdoor attacks threaten not just system accuracy, but also user trust and safety. The works listed cemented backdoor/poisoning research as a key area for AI security, shaping best practices for how large models are trained, maintained, and deployed over the long term.",

          "response": "During the AI boom period, the research community experienced a surge of activity centered around understanding, exploiting, and mitigating vulnerabilities associated with poisoning and backdoor attacks. This era was characterized by several interconnected trends and developments:\n\n1. An Arms Race Between Attackers and Defenders:  \n   Many studies focused on both advancing attack techniques and proposing defenses. Researchers looked into inserting stealthy backdoors that could remain hidden within large-scale models—be they large language models (LLMs), vision language models (VLMs), or systems that combine language with retrieval components (RAG). This dual approach highlighted the immediate need to understand how vulnerabilities could be exploited in increasingly complex systems and how to counteract those exploits.\n\n2. Sophisticated Attack Approaches:  \n   The timeline shows a number of papers that introduced innovative attack approaches:\n   - Poisoning attacks that target the model’s training process, often by subtly altering portions of the training data until the malicious behavior is triggered.\n   - Attacks that tampered with retrieval-augmented generation systems, demonstrating that even hybrid models combining retrieval and generation were vulnerable.\n   - Novel strategies like \"Merge Hijacking\" where backdoors were introduced during the model merging process, particularly affecting large language models.\n\n3. Diverse Application Domains:  \n   The work wasn’t limited to text alone. Several studies specifically targeted vision language models (VLMs) and code-adapted systems:\n   - Some papers analyzed why code-specific LLMs might be more susceptible to backdoor attacks.\n   - Others examined how scattered training patches could be aggregated by VLMs to trigger unexpected behaviors, indicating vulnerabilities not only in data but in feature extraction and integration processes.\n\n4. Exploration of Defensive Measures:  \n   On the defense side, researchers proposed a variety of protective approaches:\n   - Robust anti-backdoor instruction tuning in large vision-language models.\n   - Self-defending agents that could recognize and neutralize backdoor triggers autonomously.\n   - Cleaning strategies for backdoors in fine-tuning scenarios, allowing the repair of compromised models without heavy external intervention.\n\n5. Systematic Reviews and Benchmarking:  \n   The AI boom also saw efforts to systematize and understand the landscape of poisoning attacks:\n   - Comprehensive reviews and benchmarks were developed to track the progress and evaluate the impact of these attacks across different AI systems. This helped in identifying common factors that made some models particularly vulnerable.\n\n6. Broader Implications:  \n   The frenzy of research papers—many released around mid-2025—captured a broader sentiment: as AI systems grew in sophistication and became ever more impactful in critical applications, their security became a frontline concern. The community recognized that vulnerabilities like poisoning and backdoor attacks could have wide-reaching implications, not only undermining the performance of these models but also their trustworthiness and safety in deployment.\n\nIn summary, during the AI boom period, the field became a battleground of innovative attack strategies versus emerging defenses. Researchers pushed the envelope on understanding how malicious actors could subvert AI systems, while concurrently developing techniques to harden these systems against such invasive tactics. This intense period of study established a foundation for both identifying vulnerabilities and advancing robust security measures, paving the way for safer AI deployments in the future.",

          "response": "Certainly! Modeling a fully connected IoT world means anticipating how emerging backdoor and poisoning attacks (# B3) will affect devices, data, and systems that are increasingly interdependent, as well as how defenses might evolve. Here’s a synthesis of the future applications and implications based on the listed 2025 works:\n\n---\n\n## 1. **Attack Surface Expansion in IoT**\n- **Vision-Language Models (VLMs) & LLMs in IoT:** Modern IoT devices will leverage VLMs (for camera/sensor input) and LLMs (for control/automation, user interaction). The research shows that both VLMs ([2506.07214](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07214), [2506.03614](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03614)) and LLMs ([2506.06518](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06518)) are susceptible to subtle backdoor or poisoning attacks.\n    - **Implication:** Smart cameras, home assistants, medical sensors, and vehicles could be made to misinterpret signals, trigger on hidden cues, or give false outputs if poisoned/backdoored at training or fine-tuning.\n\n## 2. **Stealth and Persistence of Attacks**\n- **Stealthy Attacks:** Papers like [Spa-VLM](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23828) and [2506.07214](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07214) highlight that attacks are becoming stealthier—harder to detect, possibly persisting even after retraining or minor updates.\n    - **Implication:** IoT systems might be compromised for long periods, with attacks only triggered under specific, rare conditions (e.g., a particular sequence of sensor readings or user behaviors).\n\n## 3. **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) Vulnerabilities**\n- **RAG Systems in IoT:** Many IoT applications will use RAG (e.g., for contextual responses, knowledge retrieval for troubleshooting or automation).\n    - **Poisoning Attacks:** [2505.18543](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18543), [CPA-RAG](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19864), [2506.06151](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06151) show that attackers can poison knowledge bases or retrieval datasets—causing LLMs to provide malicious or incorrect information.\n    - **Implication:** IoT devices depending on external knowledge (e.g., for maintenance, diagnostics, or user support) can be misled at scale, potentially causing outages, misconfigurations, or unsafe actions.\n\n## 4. **Model Lifecycle Attacks**\n- **Model Merging/Finetuning:** Attacks can be inserted during model merging ([Merge Hijacking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23561)), or are only activated after fine-tuning ([2505.16567](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16567)). \n    - **Implication:** Third-party or federated IoT model updates (common in edge computing) are a new vector for backdoors to be introduced, even if the initial model is clean.\n\n## 5. **Self-Defending and Cleaning Mechanisms**\n- **Agent Self-Defense:** New techniques allow AI agents to detect/remove backdoors autonomously ([2506.08336](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08336), [2505.16916](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16916)).\n    - **Implication:** Future IoT devices may need embedded, on-device anomaly and backdoor detection—potentially running lightweight versions of these defenses in real-time.\n\n## 6. **Systematic Reviews and Factors**\n- **Vulnerability Analysis:** Systematic studies ([2506.06518](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06518), [2506.01825](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01825)) are identifying which architectures, code practices, or deployment patterns raise risk.\n    - **Implication:** Security guidelines for IoT model selection and deployment will become crucial, akin to today’s software supply chain security.\n\n---\n\n# **Key Future Applications & Scenarios**\n\n1. **IoT Device Hijacking via Model Poisoning**\n   - Attackers poison training or fine-tuning data for smart devices (cameras, speakers, thermostats, vehicles), embedding triggers that cause devices to malfunction, leak data, or grant access under specific conditions.\n\n2. **Data Poisoning in Federated Learning**\n   - In IoT swarms (e.g., smart city sensors), compromised nodes poison local training data, introducing backdoors that only manifest when models are aggregated/merged ([Merge Hijacking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23561)).\n\n3. **Stealthy Manipulation of Sensor Readings**\n   -

          "response": "Below is a condensed view of emerging trends in poisoning and backdoor attacks—along with corresponding defenses—which may inform future IoT research and applications. In a fully connected IoT ecosystem, these attack and defense mechanisms are highly relevant, since IoT platforms will increasingly rely on large models (text-only LLMs, code LLMs, and Vision–Language Models) to power everything from home assistants to industrial automation.\n\n1) Broader Scope of Attacks:  \n   • Multiple Modalities: Attackers increasingly target Vision–Language Models (VLMs) (e.g., “Backdoor Attack on Vision Language Models with Stealthy Semantic Manipulation,” “Spa-VLM”) alongside text-based LLMs. With IoT devices capturing a mix of sensor data (visual, audio, textual, etc.), new backdoor techniques are emerging that exploit cross-modal vulnerabilities.  \n   • Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG): Several works (“Joint-GCG,” “Through the Stealth Lens,” “CPA-RAG”) focus on poisoning the retrieval components behind LLMs. As IoT devices query local or cloud-based knowledge bases, poisoning these data sources can yield stealthy and far-reaching effects during query-time or instruction-following.  \n   • Code LLMs: Studies of “Which Factors Make Code LLMs More Vulnerable…” highlight that code-generation systems (used for IoT firmware updates or automation) can be especially prone to backdoor triggers embedded in code repositories.  \n\n2) More Stealthy Techniques and Harder-to-Detect Threats:  \n   • Semantic Manipulation: Instead of obvious triggers (e.g., a specific word or image), attackers use subtle “semantic triggers” that are more difficult to spot. This carries high risks in IoT camera feeds, medical sensors, or industrial logs, which can be stealth-poisoned to mislead a model.  \n   • Covert & Aggregative Attacks: Approaches like “VLMs Can Aggregate Scattered Training Patches” and “Merge Hijacking” show that backdoor attacks can be distributed in multiple fragments. In connected IoT networks, these fragments might be sprinkled across various devices or data streams, then get aggregated during large-scale training or model updates.\n\n3) Vulnerabilities During Finetuning, Merging, and Updates:  \n   • Finetuning-Activated Backdoors: Attackers inject dormant triggers that remain benign in the pre-trained model but activate when an IoT vendor fine-tunes or updates the model (“Finetuning-Activated Backdoors in LLMs”).  \n   • Model Merging: “Merge Hijacking” demonstrates how combining models (e.g., merging local and cloud-based modules in IoT) can inadvertently activate or insert backdoors. This is a concern whenever IoT developers integrate multiple pretrained components.  \n\n4) Defenses & Countermeasures:  \n   • Robust Anti-Backdoor Instruction Tuning: Research into specialized finetuning or robust training strategies aims to defend LLMs/VLMs from stealthy triggers. For IoT, these methods can be built into pipelines that ingest sensor data or user instructions.  \n   • Self-Defense via Agents: “Your Agent Can Defend Itself…” proposes that agents (e.g., AI controllers embedded in IoT devices) can monitor and detect malicious triggers at runtime. As IoT moves toward more autonomous decision-making, in-model self-defense or anomaly detection will be critical.  \n   • Backdoor Cleaning without External Guidance: Techniques that systematically sanitize models (“Backdoor Cleaning…MLLM Fine-tuning”) are essential when direct oversight or curated training data are limited—often the case in large, decentralized IoT networks.  \n\n5) Implications for Future IoT Applications:  \n   • Trust in Shared Models: Fully connected IoT solutions often rely on shared or open-source models. Poisoning at any step in the supply chain can compromise entire networks.  \n   • Continuous Verification: As IoT models learn on the fly (e.g., from local environment data), continuous verification or scanning for anomalies becomes a key defense.  \n   • Attack–Defense Co-evolution: As new stealthy manipulations emerge, IoT developers will need updated detection methods, robust training frameworks, and real-time guardrails.\n\nIn short, future IoT platforms—where devices continuously interact with large multimodal models—will face novel poisoning and backdoor threats targeting every layer of data processing and model training. To prepare, IoT researchers and practitioners should track these evolving techniques in LLM/VLM security, adopt robust countermeasures early, and actively integrate backdoor defense strategies into the IoT runtime environment.",

          "response": "The research directions summarized in the list provide an insight into emerging threats and defenses that are likely to influence the future of connected systems—including a fully connected IoT world. Here’s an overview of how future applications of poisoning and backdoor techniques (and the corresponding defenses) might play out in the IoT context:\n\n1. Integration of AI and IoT:  \n   • Future IoT systems will increasingly use large language models (LLMs), vision-language models (VLMs), and hybrid systems (e.g., retrieval-augmented generation or RAG) to enhance functionalities such as natural language interaction, context awareness, and automated decision-making.  \n   • With these AI components embedded in IoT devices (from smart home assistants to industrial sensors), the risk of model poisoning or backdoor attacks becomes a critical security concern. Cyber adversaries might manipulate the training or fine-tuning phases to embed hidden behaviors that could later trigger unintended device actions.\n\n2. Poisoning Attacks – Manipulating Decision-Making:  \n   • Several listed works focus on poisoning attacks that subtly alter the training data or gradients to cause misbehavior. In an IoT environment, for instance, an attacker could alter sensor input data or interfere with the training of an edge AI, causing devices to misinterpret environmental cues.  \n   • An adversary could poison the retrieval-augmented models that IoT devices use to provide context or recommendations. This might lead to false alarms, misrouted control commands, or even physical hazards if critical systems like autonomous vehicles or industrial robots are involved.\n\n3. Backdoor Attacks – Exploiting Hidden Triggers:  \n   • Backdoor attacks can embed stealthy triggers into AI models. In the IoT world, such triggers might be activated by specific environmental conditions or seemingly benign inputs, resulting in compromised operations of connected devices.  \n   • For example, smart city infrastructure that relies on vision-based models (like surveillance cameras with integrated VLMs) could be manipulated to overlook specific events or misclassify activities if a backdoor is triggered by a patterned signal or subtle semantic manipulation.\n\n4. Evolving Defenses and Self-Defending Agents:  \n   • Research on robust anti-backdoor tuning and self-defending agents indicates that future IoT systems may include mechanisms to detect and mitigate such attacks autonomously.  \n   • Defense strategies could involve continuous model validation, real-time anomaly detection in sensor data, or even embedded “immune” modules that monitor model outputs against expected behavior ranges.\n\n5. Challenges with Code and Model Merging:  \n   • The noted vulnerabilities in code LLMs and issues like merge hijacking indicate that IoT devices updating via over-the-air (OTA) mechanisms or continuously fine-tuning their local AI components could be at risk during the update/merging process.  \n   • Attackers could exploit these update channels to introduce malicious functionalities that remain hidden until activated under certain conditions, leading to cascading failures or coordinated breaches across the network.\n\n6. Broader Implications for IoT Security:  \n   • The convergence of multiple AI modalities and the diversity of data sources in IoT ecosystems means that any poisoning or backdoor vulnerability in one component can potentially compromise the entire network.  \n   • As devices become more interconnected, threats may not be confined to a single device but could spread, undermining trust in the entire IoT infrastructure.\n\n7. Future Research and Practical Applications:  \n   • The systematic reviews and targeted studies mentioned signal an increasing need to safeguard AI-driven IoT systems not just in isolated devices but at a network-wide level.  \n   • Future research might focus on developing standardized protocols for secure model updates, real-time distributed monitoring systems, and fail-safe measures that isolate malicious behavior before it affects critical operations.\n\nIn summary, as IoT devices become smarter and more interconnected through integrated AI models, understanding and mitigating the risks posed by poisoning and backdoor attacks will be paramount. The papers you’ve listed provide both cautionary insights and potential defense mechanisms, which can inform the design of next-generation IoT systems that are resilient against sophisticated, multi-modality attacks.",

Robustness and Trustworthiness:\n- Robust anti-backdoor training methods and instruction tuning will become standard in IoT development pipelines. As IoT applications begin to integrate LLMs and VLMs, rigorous testing, validation, and model hygiene practices will become critical to ensure trustworthiness.\n\n#### E. Regulatory and Compliance Considerations:\n- Emerging standards and regulations may increasingly require IoT systems to demonstrate resistance against poisoning and backdoor attacks. Manufacturers and service providers will need to comply by adopting rigorous methodologies for model transparency, security audits, and robustness verification.\n\n### 3.

You can select and adapt from these questions based on the specific focus of your event.\n\n──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nI. FOUNDATIONAL & MOTIVATIONAL QUESTIONS\n──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n\n1. Motivation & Impact:  \n   • Why are poisoning and backdoor attacks considered such high-impact threats to the deployment of LLMs and VLMs?  \n   • What are the realistic adversarial goals (e.g., stealth manipulation, model hijacking) that drive research in these areas?\n\n2. Types of Defenses:  \n   • Does defending against backdoor attacks differ fundamentally from defending against generic adversarial or poisoning attacks?  \n   • Which existing defense strategies (model inspection, robust fine-tuning, etc.) appear most promising, and what are their biggest limitations?\n\n3. Stealth and Covert Operations:  \n   • Several papers emphasize “stealthy” or “covert” poisoning. How do attackers ensure stealth, and what detection techniques might counteract these methods?  \n   • Has the arms race between stealth attacks and advanced detection led to fundamentally new angles of research?\n\n──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nII. ATTACK MECHANISMS & CASE STUDIES\n──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n\n4. Retrospective on RAG Attacks:  \n   • “Joint-GCG,” “Through the Stealth Lens,” and “Benchmarking Poisoning Attacks” all point to retrieval-augmented systems as new targets. What special vulnerabilities do RAG-based architectures have compared to non-RAG systems?  \n   • Is it more challenging to design or detect a poisoning attack when the system’s knowledge is drawn from external databases or APIs?\n\n5. Fine-Tuning Trigger Points:  \n   • Papers such as “Finetuning-Activated Backdoors in LLMs” highlight how backdoors can lie dormant until a fine-tuning phase. At which model layers or processes are these backdoors typically injected, and how reliably can they be triggered?\n\n6. Code-Specific Vulnerabilities:  \n   • “Which Factors Make Code LLMs More Vulnerable to Backdoor Attacks?” focuses on code-generating systems. Does the structured nature of code lead to distinct vulnerabilities (e.g., syntax-based triggers)?  \n   • How do you balance the need for open-source code models and the risk of malicious code patches?\n\n7. Model Merging as an Attack Vector:  \n   • “Merge Hijacking” discusses backdoor attacks during model merging. How do merging-based vulnerabilities differ from conventional data poisoning attacks or parameter-level manipulations?\n\n──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nIII. DEFENSE STRATEGIES & MITIGATIONS\n──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n\n8. Robust Anti-Backdoor Fine-Tuning Measures:  \n   • Methods like “Robust Anti-Backdoor Instruction Tuning in LVLMs” propose new training pipelines. Which parts of the training pipeline (data selection, model architecture, hyperparameters) are most critical for robust defense?\n\n9. Automated or Agent-Based Defenses:  \n   • “Your Agent Can Defend Itself against Backdoor Attacks” proposes autonomous defense strategies. What are the challenges to having the model or agent itself identify and neutralize malicious inputs or learned triggers?\n\n10. Post-Hoc Cleaning & Sanitization:  \n   • “Backdoor Cleaning without External Guidance in MLLM Fine-tuning” suggests removing or mitigating backdoors without external supervision. What are the pros and cons of automated cleansing, and how reliable is this method in practice?  \n   • Do automated cleaning techniques risk overly constraining the model or harming non-adversarial capabilities?\n\n──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nIV. FUTURE DIRECTIONS & OPEN PROBLEMS\n──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n\n11. Standardized Benchmarks & Protocols:  \n   • A few of these papers propose or use benchmarks for poisoning attacks on LLMs and VLMs. Which open-source or community-driven metrics might help unify research progress?  \n   • How can we encourage consistent reporting of success metrics and threat models?\n\n12. Interdisciplinary Approaches:  \n   • Poisoning and backdoor attacks can intersect with privacy, interpretability, and secure software development. In what ways can collaboration with researchers from these fields lead to better defense paradigms?\n\n13. Proactive vs. Reactive Strategies:  \n   • How can large organizations and open-source communities proactively design their pipelines to minimize the risk of poisoning (e.g., data curation, secure model shares)?  \n   • What reactive measures, such as auditing or “model forensics,” should be instituted once a model is in production?\n\n14. Beyond Text and Vision:  \n   • The papers focus on text-based LLMs and multi-modal VLMs, but attacks could also target speech, robotics, or reinforcement learning systems. Which unique challenges or new vulnerabilities might arise when these modalities are integrated?\n\n15. Ethical & Regulatory Considerations:  \n   • What ethical frameworks or regulations (e.g., requirements for transparency in model provenance and fine-tuning history) could help mitigate or deter poisoning and backdoor attacks?  \n   • How do we manage transparency trade-offs (public knowledge of a model’s vulnerabilities vs. enabling attackers)?\n\n──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n\nThese questions should offer ample breadth for a thorough discussion—from foundational issues and attack techniques to forward-looking defenses and policies. Feel free to pick and adapt the prompts that best align with your panelists’ expertise and the focus of your session.",

They range from technical details about attack mechanisms and defenses to broader strategic issues around model trustworthiness and system design:\n\n1. Understanding Concepts and Taxonomies\n • What are the key differences between poisoning attacks and backdoor attacks in the context of large models and retrieval-augmented systems?\n • How do the definitions and threat models differ when considering LLMs versus VLMs (or even code LLMs and agents)?\n\n2. Technical and Methodological Questions\n • Many papers (e.g., Robust Anti-Backdoor Instruction Tuning, Finetuning-Activated Backdoors) propose novel tuning and fine-tuning methodologies. What are the main technical challenges they address, and what assumptions do they make about training data and architecture vulnerabilities?\n • In studies like “Joint-GCG” and “Through the Stealth Lens,” gradient-based poisoning and stealthy semantic manipulation techniques are proposed. How do these techniques compare in terms of effectiveness and detectability?\n • For backdoor attacks enabled through model merging (Merge Hijacking), what conditions or vulnerabilities during the merging process make such attacks feasible? How might one design merging algorithms to limit these risks?\n\n3. Evaluation and Metrics\n • How are the success and stealthiness of backdoor/poisoning attacks measured? What metrics are typically used to assess whether an attack remains covert, yet effective?\n • What benchmarks or datasets are used in these papers to simulate realistic adversarial scenarios? Are these representative of real-world deployments?\n\n4. Impact on System Components\n • In retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems, how does the interplay between the retrieval module and the generation module affect vulnerability to backdoor and poisoning attacks?\n • Regarding VLM-specific vulnerabilities (e.g., in papers on VLM backdoors and patch aggregation), what are the unique challenges posed by multi-modal training data compared to purely language-based models?\n\n5. Defense Strategies and Robustness\n • Papers like “Your Agent Can Defend Itself” and “Backdoor Cleaning without External Guidance” suggest self-defense and cleaning mechanisms. What are the principles behind these strategies, and what limitations might they face in adversarial settings?\n • Across the works reviewed, what recurring themes emerge in designing defenses against poisoning or backdoor attacks? Are there common pitfalls in current defense approaches?\n\n6. Domain-specific Questions\n • For code LLMs, what factors contribute to their increased vulnerability to backdoor attacks? How do these vulnerabilities influence the safe deployment of models in code-related applications?\n • Considering RAG-based systems, what are the implications of covert poisoning attacks for systems that rely heavily on external retrieval? How might one redesign retrieval mechanisms to mitigate such attacks?\n\n7. Broader and Future Directions\n • What does the evolution of these attack methods imply for future model development, especially as models become larger and more integrated (e.g., combining language, vision, and agent capabilities)?\n • How can academic and industry researchers collaborate to design more resilient training procedures and evaluation protocols that account for increasingly stealthy and sophisticated attacks?\n • In what ways might regulatory frameworks or industry standards need to change to incorporate the latest understandings of these poisoning and backdoor risks?\n\nBy addressing these questions, you can help guide a rich discussion that not only navigates the technical details of individual papers but also explores strategic implications for model design and security in both research and real-world applications.",

          "response": "Certainly! Let's briefly outline, in a purely theoretical sense, how the techniques and attacks described in # B3. Poison & Backdoor (as exemplified by the cited papers) work in principle.\n\n## 1. Poisoning Attacks\n\n**What are they?**\n- Poisoning attacks involve injecting malicious data into the training set so that the trained model learns harmful behaviors, often without degrading its overall performance.\n\n**How do they work (theoretically)?**\n- **Data Injection:** The attacker modifies or adds crafted examples to the training data. For instance, in RAG (retrieval-augmented generation), this might be inserting misleading or “triggered” documents into the corpus.\n- **Trigger Association:** The malicious data is labeled or constructed so that when a specific input pattern (the “trigger”) appears at inference time, the model produces the attacker's desired output (e.g., a specific response, or a bias).\n- **Backdoor Activation:** During normal operation, the model behaves as expected. However, when the trigger is present, the backdoor activates, causing the model to misbehave (e.g., output a specific phrase, retrieve a poisoned document, or perform an unintended action).\n\n**Variants:**\n- **Stealthy poisoning:** The poisoned examples are designed to be hard to detect by humans or standard data cleaning.\n- **Targeted vs. untargeted:** The backdoor may cause specific misbehavior (targeted) or general degradation (untargeted).\n- **Covert attacks in RAG:** Poisoned documents are injected in such a way that the retrieval system is more likely to fetch them for certain queries, thus influencing the generation outcome.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Backdoor Attacks in Model Weights\n\n**What are they?**\n- Backdoor attacks can also be implemented by manipulating model weights or during fine-tuning/merging, rather than (or in addition to) data poisoning.\n\n**How do they work (theoretically)?**\n- **Weight Manipulation:** An attacker may fine-tune a model on poisoned data, or directly alter weights, so that the model encodes a hidden behavior activated by a trigger.\n- **Model Merging:** When merging models (e.g., two LLMs), a backdoor can be introduced such that the merged model responds maliciously to certain inputs, even if neither original model was backdoored.\n- **Finetuning-Activated Backdoors:** The backdoor is dormant until certain fine-tuning procedures (possibly done by the victim) activate it.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Defense & Detection (Theoretical)\n\n**Defenses aim to:**\n- Detect or remove poisoned data (data sanitization).\n- Identify anomalous model behaviors (e.g., via adversarial testing or trigger search).\n- Remove backdoors from weights (e.g., via model fine-pruning, or robust finetuning).\n- Employ robust training methods (e.g., robust instruction tuning).\n\n---\n\n## 4. Example: Backdoor Attack on a VLM (Vision-Language Model)\n\n1. **Training Phase:**\n   - Attacker injects image-caption pairs into the training set, where a small visual pattern (the trigger) is always associated with a specific output phrase.\n2. **Deployment:**\n   - For normal images, the VLM works as expected.\n   - For images containing the trigger, the VLM outputs the attacker's chosen phrase, regardless of the actual content.\n\n---\n\n## 5. Example: Poisoning in RAG\n\n1. **Corpus Poisoning:**\n   - Attacker inserts documents into the retrieval corpus containing a specific trigger phrase and a desired response.\n2. **At Query Time:**\n   - When a user query contains (or is similar to) the trigger, the retrieval system is more likely to fetch the poisoned document, causing the generator to output the attacker's desired information.\n\n---\n\n## 6. Key Points\n\n- **Triggers:** Backdoor triggers are special patterns (text, image, code) that activate the malicious behavior.\n- **Stealth:** Effective attacks are designed to be stealthy—difficult to detect through normal validation or inspection.\n- **Scope:** Attacks can target general LLMs, VLMs, code LLMs, RAG systems, or any fine-tuned/merged model.\n\n---\n\n**References in your list (e.g., \"Backdoor Attack on Vision Language Models with Stealthy Semantic Manipulation\", \"Covert Poisoning Attacks on Retrieval-Augmented Generation in LLMs\", \"Merge Hijacking\") all describe variations on these basic theoretical mechanisms, applied in different modalities or model architectures.**\n\nIf you want a more detailed mechanism on a specific paper or attack type, let me know!",

          "response": "In broad terms, “poisoning” and “backdoor” attacks both aim to subvert a model’s behavior by introducing carefully crafted hidden signals (also called “triggers” or “markers”) into its training or fine-tuning process. Below is a purely theoretical overview of how these attacks (and proposed defenses) typically work, with references to the themes and methods appearing in the listed papers.\n\n───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n1. Poisoning Attacks\n───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nPoisoning attacks usually revolve around injecting a small amount of “tainted” data or model updates so that the trained model learns to produce incorrect outputs in specific scenarios. In practice, a poisoning attack might:\n• Inject misleading examples into the training corpus or retrieval database.  \n• Modify the underlying training pipeline to favor certain erroneous patterns.  \n\nConceptually, these attacks exploit two key properties of large models:\n1. Overparameterization: Large models can memorize or incorporate spurious correlations (i.e., “shortcuts”) if those correlations are consistently present in training data.  \n2. Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) sensitivity: Adding or modifying just a small fraction of the training samples (or training steps) can shift model parameters in unexpected ways.\n\nThus, from a high-level theoretical viewpoint:\n• The attacker crafts a poison set (or modifies the retrieval database).  \n• When the model trains or updates, it unwittingly absorbs the malicious signal.  \n• At inference time—especially for tasks or inputs that match the malicious signal—the model’s output becomes biased, incorrect, or attacker-specified.\n\nMany references above, especially those mentioning “poisoning attacks against Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)” (e.g., Joint-GCG, Spa-VLM, CPA-RAG, and benchmarking works), focus on how the retrieval databases or relevant prompts can be subtly tampered with. Because RAG systems consult external knowledge sources or indexes, searching or rewriting those sources is a powerful vantage point for malicious activities.\n\n───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n2. Backdoor Attacks\n───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nBackdoor attacks are a specialized subset of poisoning attacks. They aim to train a model such that:\n• Under normal conditions, the model behaves as expected (and may pass standard evaluations).  \n• When a particular hidden “trigger” (e.g., a specific token sequence, image patch, or watermark) appears in the input, the model’s output changes to something attacker-controlled.\n\nBecause the malicious behavior only emerges if the secret trigger is present, these attacks are often harder to detect or diagnose. Theoretically, backdoor attacks hinge on:\n1. Model Overfitting to Rare Features: Even a few labeled examples containing the trigger (crafted by the attacker) can cause the model to associate that trigger with a certain “backdoored” output.  \n2. Conditional Behavior: The model’s learned parameters interpret the trigger as a strong, specialized feature at inference time, but otherwise remain neutral.\n\nSeveral papers in the list address new and subtler ways to embed or detect such triggers. For instance:\n• “Stealthy Semantic Manipulation” refers to hiding triggers in visually or textually subtle elements, so that human inspectors might not notice.  \n• “Finetuning-Activated Backdoors” explores how an attacker can install a backdoor early, which only becomes active after certain fine-tuning steps.  \n• “Merge Hijacking” shows that combining multiple large models (using open-source quants or merges) can inadvertently resurrect or install a new backdoor.\n\n───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n3. Defenses and Clean-Up Techniques\n───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nWhile the attacks cut across different modalities (LLMs, VLMs, agent-based systems, code models, etc.), the theoretical defenses often share core ideas:\n• Outlier Detection: Identify and remove suspicious data points from training.  \n• Robust Training Methods: Modify the training objective (e.g., via gradient clipping, restricting model capacity, or special regularization) to reduce the effect of small malicious data subsets.  \n• Post-hoc Model Inspection: Searching within model parameters or outputs for hidden triggers.  \n• Sanitizing Merges/Retrieval Indices: Checking or filtering the combined model weights, or verifying the correctness of the retrieval database.\n\nIn short, these methods attempt to limit how much a small set of malicious “signals” can shift a (large) model’s learned representations.\n\n───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n4. Summarizing the Common Theoretical Threads\n───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nAcross these papers, a few themes persist:\n\n1. Attack Vector:  \n   – Poisoning typically modifies a fraction of the training or fine-tuning data (or the retrieval database).  \n   – Backdooring introduces a hidden “trigger” that activates only under specific input conditions.\n\n2. Mechanism of Influence:  \n   – Large models can be coerced to memorize or overfit to rare features if those features are consistently inserted with carefully designed labels.  \n   – The hidden “trigger” can be embedded at data level (e.g., in text or images), or at model level (e.g., in the parameter space).\n\n3. Stealth:  \n   – The goal is often to remain undetected: a backdoored or poisoned model should respond normally for typical inputs.  \n   – Attacks may conceal triggers in semantically benign elements (e.g., punctuation patterns, subtle watermarks) so that even advanced anomaly detection can be thwarted.\n\n4. Evasion vs. Detection:  \n   – Attackers refine triggers to evade standard detection methods.  \n   – Defenders develop ever more sophisticated tools to scan training corpora or learned parameters for anomalies.\n\nOverall, in a purely theoretical framework, the gist is: by injecting a small but cleverly engineered perturbation—whether in training data or parameter merges—an attacker can cause a large model (LLM or VLM) to exhibit unexpected behaviors under specific conditions. Meanwhile, defenders work on techniques (e.g., robust training, data filtering, post-hoc detection) to remove or mitigate these hidden manipulations.",

          "response": "Theoretically speaking, poison and backdoor attacks on large models (whether language, vision, or combined modalities) rely on manipulating the training or fine‐tuning processes in a subtle way so that the model behaves normally on most inputs but “activates” a hidden, adversarial behavior when seeing a special trigger. Here’s a breakdown of the core theoretical ideas behind these attacks:\n\n1. Trigger Injection versus Regular Data:  \n • The attacker introduces a small number of modified examples (“poisoned samples”) into the training data or the retrieval database. These examples contain a specific trigger (which might be a unique token, pattern, or semantic manipulation) that is statistically rare or nearly invisible during normal operation.  \n • During training, the model learns both from the clean and the poisoned examples. On clean data it performs well on the main task, but when it encounters the trigger, the influence of the adversarial examples steers its output toward the attacker’s intended behavior.\n\n2. Altering the Optimization Landscape:  \n • Fundamentally, training a machine learning model is about optimizing a loss function over a large, heterogeneous dataset. By injecting specially crafted poisoned examples, the attacker subtly shifts the model’s parameter configuration.  \n • The poisoned samples are designed so that while their effect on the overall loss during standard training is minimal, they still sufficiently “nudge” the model to associate the trigger with a backdoor behavior. This implicit “conditional” mapping is not apparent in the bulk of the training data.\n\n3. Stealth and Robustness:  \n • For a truly stealthy attack, the modifications must not degrade performance on benign examples. This means that the trigger needs to be unique and ideally imperceptible when not intentionally activated.  \n • The theoretical challenge here is to balance the loss: if the malicious goal is too aggressively optimized, the model might become noticeably biased, whereas too subtle an attack might not reliably trigger the backdoor.  \n • Some of the papers describe “stealthy semantic manipulation” and “covert poisoning” where the triggers are integrated in ways that are semantically consistent with the data, ensuring that the altered samples look “normal” except for the hidden trigger.\n\n4. Activation Mechanism in Inference:  \n • Once trained, the backdoor remains dormant as long as the trigger is not present. The model operates as expected, but when the trigger is encountered, it causes a significant shift in the internal representations (or activations) learned during training, producing a manipulated output.  \n • In retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems, the adversary might even target the retrieval mechanism itself by poisoning the underlying knowledge base or modifying the selector’s behavior, so that when a query with the trigger is issued, misleading information is retrieved and influences output generation.\n\n5. Fine-Tuning and Merge Hijacking:  \n • Another theoretical angle addressed in some works is that backdoors might be introduced via fine-tuning or even during model merging. Essentially, even if a base model is clean, a later fine-tuning phase with poisoned data can implant backdoors.  \n • When multiple models or data sources are merged, discrepancies might allow a hidden backdoor signal (from one subset) to propagate undetected if the merge process doesn’t sufficiently align the counterfactual patterns across datasets.\n\n6. Defenses and Robustness Considerations:  \n • The theoretical countermeasure is to detect anomalous patterns during training or to enforce robustness through techniques like “adversarial training” or “anti-backdoor tuning.”  \n • However, as some titles suggest (e.g., “Your Agent Can Defend Itself against Backdoor Attacks”), there is also work dedicated to enabling a model to recognize when its behavior might be influenced by such hidden triggers and then self-correct or alert the end-user.\n\nIn summary, at its core the idea behind a theoretical poison/backdoor attack is to subtly inject associations between a benign-looking but intentionally chosen trigger and a malicious output behavior during training. This is achieved by carefully crafting some training examples (or even tweaking components of retrieval systems) so that during inference the model, when encountering the trigger, transitions into an adversarial mode—all while maintaining high overall performance on normal tasks.",

RAG-Specific Poisoning**\n- **Knowledge Base Contamination**: Inject malicious documents into the retrieval corpus\n- **Query Hijacking**: Craft poisoned content that gets retrieved for specific query patterns\n- **Gradient-Based Optimization**: Use techniques like Joint-GCG to optimize poisoned content for maximum retrieval probability\n\n### **3. Model Merging Exploitation**\n- **Merge Hijacking**: Insert backdoors during the model merging process when combining multiple fine-tuned models\n- **Activation Timing**: Backdoors remain dormant until specific fine-tuning procedures activate them\n\n## **Defense Mechanisms**\n\n### **1. Robust Instruction Tuning**\n- **Data Sanitization**: Filter training data to remove potential triggers\n- **Adversarial Training**: Include backdoor-resistant examples during fine-tuning\n- **Behavioral Monitoring**: Detect anomalous activation patterns during training\n\n### **2.

          "response": "Great question! Reviewing these recent case studies on poisoning and backdoor attacks reveals several emerging patterns and trends worth your attention. Here are the key patterns you should look for as you analyze these works:\n\n---\n\n## 1. **Modality Expansion**\n- **LLM, VLM, RAG, and Agents:** Attacks are no longer limited to textual LLMs. Recent work targets Vision-Language Models (VLMs), Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems, and even autonomous agents.\n- **Example:** \"Backdoor Attack on Vision Language Models with Stealthy Semantic Manipulation\" and \"Spa-VLM: Stealthy Poisoning Attacks on RAG-based VLM\".\n\n---\n\n## 2. **Stealth and Sophistication of Attacks**\n- **Covert/Stealth Approaches:** Modern poisoning and backdoor attacks focus on being hard to detect, e.g., semantic triggers, scattered training patches, or covert poisoning (\"CPA-RAG\").\n- **Example:** \"VLMs Can Aggregate Scattered Training Patches\" and \"Spa-VLM: Stealthy Poisoning Attacks\".\n\n---\n\n## 3. **Targeted Pipeline Stages**\n- **Instruction Tuning & Finetuning:** Attacks often exploit vulnerable stages like instruction tuning or finetuning, which can introduce or activate backdoors.\n- **Example:** \"Robust Anti-Backdoor Instruction Tuning in LVLMs\" and \"Finetuning-Activated Backdoors in LLMs\".\n\n---\n\n## 4. **Systematic Reviews & Benchmarking**\n- **Systematization:** There is a trend toward comprehensive reviews and benchmarking frameworks to evaluate threats and defenses across models and pipelines.\n- **Example:** \"A Systematic Review of Poisoning Attacks Against Large Language Models\" and \"Benchmarking Poisoning Attacks against Retrieval-Augmented Generation\".\n\n---\n\n## 5. **Emerging Defense Strategies**\n- **Self-Defense & Backdoor Cleaning:** Some studies propose proactive (built-in) defenses, detection, and even automatic cleaning mechanisms that don't rely on external data.\n- **Example:** \"Your Agent Can Defend Itself against Backdoor Attacks\" and \"Backdoor Cleaning without External Guidance in MLLM Fine-tuning\".\n\n---\n\n## 6. **Attack Vectors and Triggers**\n- **Semantic and Contextual Triggers:** Rather than obvious triggers, attackers use subtle, context-based, or semantic triggers that are difficult to isolate.\n- **Example:** \"Backdoor Attack on Vision Language Models with Stealthy Semantic Manipulation\".\n\n---\n\n## 7. **Focus on RAG Vulnerabilities**\n- **RAG-Specific Threats:** Attacks tailored for retrieval-augmented systems exploit the interaction between retrieval and generation, e.g., poisoning the retriever or index.\n- **Example:** \"Joint-GCG: Unified Gradient-Based Poisoning Attacks on Retrieval-Augmented Generation Systems\", \"CPA-RAG\".\n\n---\n\n## 8. **Model Merging and Compositional Attacks**\n- **Model Combination Risks:** New attack vectors emerge when models are merged or composed, transferring or activating dormant backdoors.\n- **Example:** \"Merge Hijacking: Backdoor Attacks to Model Merging of Large Language Models\".\n\n---\n\n## 9. **Factors Influencing Vulnerability**\n- **Model/Training Factors:** Some studies analyze what makes certain models (e.g., code LLMs) more susceptible to backdoors.\n- **Example:** \"Which Factors Make Code LLMs More Vulnerable to Backdoor Attacks? A Systematic Study\".\n\n---\n\n## 10. **Gradient-Based or Unified Attack Methods**\n- **Generalizable Attack Techniques:** Some methods generalize across architectures or tasks, such as unified gradient-based poisoning.\n- **Example:** \"Joint-GCG: Unified Gradient-Based Poisoning Attacks\".\n\n---\n\n# **Summary Table of Patterns**\n\n| Pattern                       | Description                                | Example Papers                                         |\n|-------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|\n| Modality Expansion            | Beyond text LLMs to VLMs, RAG, agents      | 1, 3, 9                                                |\n| Stealth/Sophistication        | Semantic, scattered, or covert triggers    | 3, 6, 7, 9                                             |\n| Vulnerable Pipeline Stages    | Instruction tuning, finetuning             | 1, 13                                                  |\n| Systematic Reviews/Benchmarking| Comprehensive threat/defense analysis     | 4, 10                                                  |\n| Emerging Defenses             | Self-defense, cleaning, proactive methods  | 5, 14                                                  |\n| Attack Vector Innovation      | Semantic/contextual rather than simple     | 3, 6                                                   |\n| RAG-Specific Vulnerabilities  | Poisoning retrievers/indices               | 2, 8, 11                                               |\n| Model Merging Attacks         | Backdoors transferred via merging          | 12                                                     |\n| Vulnerability Factors         | What makes models more/less vulnerable     | 6                                                      |\n| Unified Attack Methods        | Gradient-based/generalizable attacks       | 2                                                      |\n\n---\n\n## **What This Means for Your Review**\n- Look for **how attacks are constructed and hidden** (semantic triggers, poisoning stages, etc.).\n- Assess the **breadth of systems and modalities** being targeted.\n- Pay attention to **defense strategies** and their generalizability.\n- Note any **systematic studies** or benchmarking efforts—these help standardize understanding and evaluation.\n- Identify **newly exposed vulnerabilities** (e.g., from model merging or RAG-specific architectures).\n- Consider **factors increasing risk**—model size, data type, training pipeline, etc.\n\n---\n\n**In summary:**  \nThe field is rapidly evolving from basic poisoning to sophisticated, stealthy attacks across diverse modalities and architectures, with parallel advances in defenses and evaluation frameworks. Watch for innovation both in attack and defense, and in understanding the underlying causes of vulnerability.\n\nIf you want a visual summary or deeper analysis of any specific pattern or paper, let me know!",

          "response": "When you examine the research on backdoor and poisoning attacks in large (and multimodal) models, you will notice that certain motifs surface repeatedly—whether in purely text‐based LLMs or in vision‐language models (VLMs) and retrieval‐augmented systems (RAG). The following patterns or “red flags” tend to recur:\n\n1) Stealthy “Trigger” Embedding  \n   • Many attacks quietly embed small perturbations or hidden “triggers” that do not overtly degrade performance on normal inputs.  \n   • These triggers can be inserted at various levels: “patches” in images, keywords in textual corpora, or carefully placed modifications in code examples—usually with the goal of subtlety.\n\n2) Fine‐Tuning and Merging as Attack Vectors  \n   • Papers on model “merging” show that attackers can backdoor a model, then stealthily merge it with a benign model so the backdoor remains latent until a specific trigger is encountered.  \n   • Even standard instruction‐tuning or domain‐adaptive fine‐tuning can “awaken” a hidden backdoor if the attacker planted it during pretraining or earlier training stages.\n\n3) Retrieval‐Augmented Generation (RAG) Vulnerabilities  \n   • A recurring theme is that many RAG pipelines are susceptible to poisoning in their retrieval corpus. Attackers alter not the model’s parameters but the documents the model retrieves. This leaves the model intact yet yields malicious outputs when particular queries are made.  \n   • Because RAG pipelines rely on large external corpora, the surface for poisoning can be larger and easier to manipulate than the base model’s weights.\n\n4) Semantic or Gradient‐Based Poisoning of Training Data  \n   • A number of methods “pollute” a minority slice of training data so that the model associates a hidden trigger with a malicious output.  \n   • Researchers show that attackers can select or craft examples using gradient‐based approaches to maximize the potency of the backdoor while maintaining minimal detectability.\n\n5) Activation Only Under Specific Contexts  \n   • Many backdoors are “conditional” and intentionally remain dormant in normal usage. They activate only when certain textual prompts, tokens, images, or tasks are seen.  \n   • This allows the compromised model to remain unnoticed in typical evaluations (standard benchmarks, common prompts).\n\n6) Multi‐Stage or Layered Attacks  \n   • Attacks may combine multiple elements: for instance, a stealthy data‐poisoning strategy plus a specialized merging operation. This multi‐stage approach can mask the malicious changes or make them harder to remove with naive defenses.\n\n7) Focus on Defenses Centering Around:  \n   • Data Sanitization: Filtering or “cleaning” data with anomaly detection or outlier filtering.  \n   • Trigger Unlearning or “Rewriting”: Retraining or rewriting suspect parameters to dampen a learned backdoor trigger.  \n   • Robust Fine‐Tuning: Methods that isolate or mitigate suspicious gradients, e.g., robust instruction tuning.  \n   • “Self‐Defense” Agents: Systems that introspect and attempt to detect or neutralize backdoors themselves.\n\nAcross all these works, the high‐level pattern is how easily even small manipulations—at the level of data, parameters, merges, or retrieval corpora—can slip by standard checks. When reading about specific attacks, watch for:\n\n• How the malicious data or model artifact is introduced.  \n• The degree to which it remains imperceptible (stealth).  \n• What triggers (keyword, image token, prompt format) unlock the backdoor.  \n• Whether the backdoor is activated by further fine‐tuning or only under certain usage conditions.  \n• Proposed defense strategies and how robust or targeted they must be.\n\nThese recurring ideas can help you quickly identify key “tells” of backdoor or poisoning strategies and guide you to the novel elements in each paper.",

          "response": "When reviewing these case studies, consider examining the following patterns and themes:\n\n1. Attack Methodology & Trigger Design  \n • What type of triggers are used? Often these attacks rely on stealthy, covert, or semantically subtle modifications that remain undetectable during normal usage.  \n • Are the triggers explicitly embedded into training data or activated only during fine-tuning? Some studies explore direct poisoning during training, while others discuss latent backdoors that only surface after finetuning or merging.  \n • Do attacks leverage gradient‐based techniques to optimize the poisoning process (as in unified gradient‐based attacks)? Note any similarities in the attack formulation.\n\n2. Modalities and System Components Targeted  \n • Which system types are being attacked? Some cases focus on pure language models (LLMs), while others target vision-language models (VLMs) or retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems.  \n • Look for patterns in the vulnerabilities across modalities. For instance, do VLMs exhibit unique challenges (like patch aggregation or semantic manipulation) compared to text-only models?  \n • Are there common characteristics in attacks targeting merged models or agent-based systems? Merging introduces a novel attack vector if one model carries a latent backdoor.\n\n3. Stealthiness & Evasion Techniques  \n • How do attackers keep the backdoors covert? Look for techniques that minimize changes to overall performance or that hide in the noise of regular training data.  \n • Some papers discuss “stealthy semantic manipulation” — examine what kinds of semantic or distribution shifts are introduced and how they fly under the radar of existing defenses.\n\n4. Attack Activation & Context Sensitivity  \n • Is the attack always active, or does it have an activation trigger (for example, triggered during finetuning or specific query contexts)?  \n • Understanding the activation conditions can help identify if the model is vulnerable only under certain contextual or operational conditions.\n\n5. Defense & Robustness Evaluation  \n • Some studies (e.g., “Your Agent Can Defend Itself…”) focus on mitigation—so note what countermeasure strategies are being proposed or tested. Are defenses preemptive (e.g., robust tuning) or reactive (e.g., backdoor cleaning without external guidance)?  \n • Compare the effectiveness of different defenses across similar attack methodologies.\n\n6. Attack Impact on Model Behavior  \n • How do the attacks affect overall model performance? Pay attention to whether the attacks degrade normal functionality or only subtly alter behavior under specific conditions.  \n • Are there trade-offs between maintaining model performance and the level of stealth in the backdoor? Some attacks might induce high risk with minimal overt performance changes, which is key for evaluating real-world impact.\n\n7. Evaluation Frameworks & Benchmarking  \n • Look for systematic approaches to quantify the vulnerability (e.g., benchmarking poisoning attacks across various systems).  \n • Identify whether the evaluation metrics match across studies, which can help spot common benchmarks or testing methodologies.\n\n8. Domain-Specific Observations  \n • For code LLMs, check if there are distinct patterns that make them more vulnerable, as one study systematically investigates.  \n • Observe if certain application domains (like retrieval-augmented systems or merged models) require unique solution approaches compared to standard language models.\n\nBy mapping these patterns—trigger design, modality-specific vulnerabilities, stealth mechanisms, activation strategies, impact assessment, and defense strategies—you can better compare studies and form a comprehensive view of both the current threat landscape and potential mitigation strategies in the realm of poisoning and backdoor attacks.",

Not all variables will apply in every scenario, but they can serve as a starting point for structuring your research design:\n\n1. Attack Mechanics and Scenarios\n   • Attack Stage: Is poisoning or the backdoor introduced during pre-training, fine-tuning, instruction tuning, model merging, or deployment/inference?  \n   • Attack Vector: Where do attackers inject poison? E.g., training dataset, synthetic dataset, model checkpoints, prompt instructions, retrieval corpus.  \n   • Trigger Design: Is the trigger visible or stealthy, semantic or non-semantic, textual or visual, single-token or multi-token?  \n   • Trigger Insertion Rate: How frequently (percentage of data samples) is the backdoor trigger injected?  \n   • Attack Stealth: Does the poisoning remain undetected by standard data-cleaning, inspection, or model-monitoring techniques?  \n   • Attack Objectives: Does the attacker aim to alter model predictions, degrade performance, or embed a hidden instruction/response?\n\n2. Model Type and Architecture\n   • Model Modality: Is the focus a Language Model (LLM), Vision-Language Model (VLM), or a multi-modal system with retrieval?  \n   • Model Size / Capacity: Are you dealing with smaller, specialized LLMs or very large foundation models?  \n   • Model Architecture Features: Transformer-based? Encoder-decoder vs. decoder-only? Cross-modal fusion for VLMs?  \n   • Pre-training vs. Fine-tuning: Which stage is more vulnerable or relevant for your threat model?\n\n3. Defense or Detection Variables (if relevant)\n   • Defensive Strategies: Are you comparing data-filtering, gradient-based detection, robust fine-tuning, distillation, or other defenses?  \n   • Detection Methods: Signature-based detection, anomaly detection, or output consistency checks.  \n   • Utility–Security Trade-off: How do different defenses balance model utility (accuracy, fluency, etc.) versus security (attack success rate reduction)?  \n\n4. Dataset and Data Characteristics\n   • Domain / Modality: Natural language text, code, images, multi-modal pairs, or retrieval-based corpora.  \n   • Data Distribution: Is the dataset balanced or imbalanced? Are triggers inserted into high-frequency or low-frequency tokens/phrases?  \n   • Size of Training Data: Small vs. large datasets can affect the stealthiness and success rate of poisoning.  \n   • Data Quality and Accessibility: Is the dataset openly accessible (public repos) or curated in a controlled environment?  \n\n5. Evaluation Metrics and Protocols\n   • Attack Success Rate (ASR): How frequently does the backdoor or poison achieve the intended malicious outcome?  \n   • Main Task Performance: Does the model still perform normally (e.g., accuracy, F1, BLEU for text, or precision/recall for retrieval) when not triggered?  \n   • Stealth Metrics: Measurements of how difficult the attack is to detect (e.g., perplexity changes, watermark detection, distributional shifts).  \n   • Efficiency / Computation: Computation overhead to execute the attack or run defenses (e.g., additional training steps, memory overhead).  \n   • Robustness Tests: Evaluations under different scenarios—adversarial prompts, different input styles, or domain shifts.  \n\n6. Poison/Backdoor Trigger Properties\n   • Trigger Complexity: Single token vs. phrase vs. image patch vs. multi-modal concept.  \n   • Semantic vs. Non-semantic: Does the trigger carry coherent meaning (e.g., a phrase that might naturally appear in text) or is it a random artifact?  \n   • Visibility / Detectability: Is the trigger easily noticeable by a human or hidden within normal data patterns?\n\n7. Environmental / Operational Factors\n   • RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) Setup: If your system includes retrieval, do triggers live in the retrieved documents, the query text, or both?  \n   • Access Level: Does the attacker have white-box (full model access) or black-box (API-only) access?  \n   • Real-World Constraints: Are you modeling specialized or open-source scenarios? How are updates to the model or dataset handled in practice?\n\n8. Research Scope and Practical Constraints\n   • Resource Availability: Constraints on computing resources, data labeling, time for iterative experiments.  \n   • Ethical Considerations: Ensuring that your research design handles potentially harmful content safely and abides by responsible disclosure practices.  \n   • Transferability: Is the attack effective across multiple architectures or tasks? Does defense generalize across models?\n\nThese categories and variables can help shape your research questions, experimental design, and evaluation strategies. They also provide a basis for comparing different backdoor or poisoning methods and defenses across various large-model environments.",

          "response": "When designing a study in the B3 (Poison & Backdoor) space, you’ll want to break down the problem into key dimensions. Here are several groups of variables you might consider:\n\n─────────────────────────  \n1. Attack Characteristics\n\n• Attack Type and Mode:  \n  – Is it a poisoning attack that corrupts the training data or a backdoor attack that implants a hidden trigger?  \n  – Within backdoor attacks, consider whether the trigger is always active or only activated under certain conditions (e.g., during fine‑tuning or inference time).\n\n• Injection/Trigger Strategy:  \n  – What kind of trigger is used (e.g., semantic, patch-based, textual prompt, pattern)?  \n  – How “visible” or “stealthy” is the trigger? Can it weave into the natural data distribution?  \n  – Are there variations, such as joint or sequential triggers across modalities (e.g., for VLMs or RAG)?\n\n• Timing and Activation:  \n  – When is the attack injected (during pretraining, phase of instruction tuning, or at fine‑tuning)?  \n  – Is the attack activated via a specific trigger or does it occur as a latent effect after model merging/finetuning?\n\n─────────────────────────  \n2. System/Model Variables\n\n• Target Model Type:  \n  – What architecture is under study? (LLM, VLM, RAG systems, or agent-based models)  \n  – How do architectural elements (e.g., retrieval components in RAG, multi-modal fusion in VLMs) affect vulnerability?\n\n• Model Training and Adaptation Protocol:  \n  – How is the model trained (from scratch, fine‑tuning, instruction tuning, merging)?  \n  – What are the training settings (learning rate, batch size, regularization) and how do they impact susceptibility?\n\n• Data Characteristics:  \n  – What datasets are used? Are they clean, or do they include a known “poisoned” subset?  \n  – How is the training corpus distributed across modalities (text vs. image data)?\n\n─────────────────────────  \n3. Outcome and Performance Metrics\n\n• Attack Success Metrics:  \n  – Backdoor insertion success rate (e.g., percentage of inputs that trigger the malicious behavior)  \n  – Poisoning attack metrics (e.g., the drop in task performance, misclassification rate, or specific targeted behaviors)\n\n• Stealth and Detectability:  \n  – How detectable is the malicious behavior in clean vs. intentionally triggered scenarios?  \n  – Evaluate metrics like false positive rates in defense mechanisms and anomaly scores under detection systems.\n\n• Impact on Clean Performance:  \n  – Does the inclusion of backdoor/poisoned samples affect overall model accuracy on clean data?  \n  – Are there trade-offs between robustness under attack and performance in benign settings?\n\n─────────────────────────  \n4. Adversary and Defender Considerations\n\n• Adversary Capabilities:  \n  – What is the assumed knowledge of the attacker about the model's internals (white‑box, black‑box, gray‑box)?  \n  – What control does the adversary have over the training pipeline or data flow?\n\n• Defense Mechanisms:  \n  – Evaluate the model’s resilience: defenses like backdoor cleaning, robust instruction tuning, or self‑defense mechanisms.  \n  – How do different defense strategies affect the backdoor/poisoning attack’s success?\n\n─────────────────────────  \n5. Contextual/Environmental Factors\n\n• Multi-modal Interactions:  \n  – For systems like VLMs or RAG, consider how attacks in one modality (e.g., visual patches) might propagate or interfere with the other modality (e.g., text querying).\n\n• Deployment Environment:  \n  – How do real-world constraints (e.g., limited access to training data, maintenance of model updates, adversarial shifts) affect both attacks and defenses?  \n  – Do temporal factors (e.g., evolving datasets and continuous learning settings) introduce new vulnerabilities or mitigate existing ones?\n\n─────────────────────────  \nSummary\n\nIn essence, the independent (or experimental) variables you may manipulate include the type of attack, trigger mechanism and timing, target model architecture, and training or merging protocols. The dependent variables could then be performance metrics (accuracy, attack success rate, detectability), changes in clean data performance, and effectiveness of any defense strategies.\n\nDesigning your research along these dimensions will allow you to map out the attack scenarios, understand their impact across various settings, and ultimately evaluate both the vulnerabilities and potential defenses in models like LLMs, VLMs, retrieval-augmented systems, and agents.",

The papers listed are grouped to move from general overviews and fundamentals to more specialized scenarios and advanced defenses. Naturally, the exact ordering can be adapted based on particular interests.\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n1) FOUNDATIONS AND OVERVIEWS\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n• A Systematic Review of Poisoning Attacks Against Large Language Models (arXiv:2506.06518)  \n  Rationale: Start by getting a broad survey of poisoning and backdoor attacks against LLMs—the threat scope, attack types, and key vulnerabilities. This sets the foundation and terminology.\n\n• Which Factors Make Code LLMs More Vulnerable to Backdoor Attacks? A Systematic Study (arXiv:2506.01825)  \n  Rationale: Next, focus on a specialized application—code generation. This paper dissects factors making code‐oriented models especially susceptible to poisoning or backdoor triggers.  \n\n• Finetuning‐Activated Backdoors in LLMs (arXiv:2505.16567)  \n  Rationale: Understand how finetuning can inadvertently (or deliberately) activate backdoors. This clarifies how “innocent” updates to a model might expose it to malicious triggers.\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n2) ATTACK VECTORS FOR LLM AND VLM\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n• Merge Hijacking: Backdoor Attacks to Model Merging of Large Language Models (arXiv:2505.23561)  \n  Rationale: Learn how attacks can be introduced during model merging processes (e.g., combining multiple model checkpoints)—a scenario very relevant in collaborative or open‐source projects.\n\n• Backdoor Attack on Vision Language Models with Stealthy Semantic Manipulation (arXiv:2506.07214)  \n  Rationale: Transition from backdoors in text‐only LLMs to VLMs, focusing on the stealthy, often imperceptible ways to embed triggers in visual or cross‐modality data.\n\n• VLMs Can Aggregate Scattered Training Patches (arXiv:2506.03614)  \n  Rationale: Highlight how modern VLMs’ capability to “piece together” knowledge makes them uniquely vulnerable to small, scattered poison‐patch signals.  \n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n3) POISONING AND BACKDOOR ATTACKS IN RAG SYSTEMS\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n• Benchmarking Poisoning Attacks against Retrieval‐Augmented Generation (arXiv:2505.18543)  \n  Rationale: Introduces the RAG (retrieval‐augmented generation) paradigm and outlines how to systematically test RAG systems against poisoning.  \n\n• CPA‐RAG: Covert Poisoning Attacks on Retrieval‐Augmented Generation in Large Language Models (arXiv:2505.19864)  \n  Rationale: Delves into more stealthy, “covert” ways of poisoning data and corrupting LLM outputs within RAG workflows.  \n\n• Joint‐GCG: Unified Gradient‐Based Poisoning Attacks on Retrieval‐Augmented Generation Systems (arXiv:2506.06151)  \n  Rationale: Explores a gradient‐based approach that unifies multiple forms of poisoning within RAG ecosystems for stronger or more adaptive attacks.\n\n• Through the Stealth Lens: Rethinking Attacks and Defenses in RAG (arXiv:2506.04390)  \n  Rationale: A broader rethinking of how to hide or reveal poisoning and backdoors in RAG, offering perspective on new, evolving stealth techniques and possible defenses.\n\n• Spa‐VLM: Stealthy Poisoning Attacks on RAG‐based VLM (arXiv:2505.23828)  \n  Rationale: Looks at the intersection: RAG plus VLM. Understand how multi‐modal retrieval plus generation can be contaminated and the unique demands on defenses.\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n4) DEFENSE STRATEGIES AND COUNTERMEASURES\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n• Backdoor Cleaning Without External Guidance in MLLM Fine‐tuning (arXiv:2505.16916)  \n  Rationale: Explores methods for mitigating or removing backdoors during multi‐modal LLM (MLLM) finetuning, even without explicit “clean” references or labels.\n\n• Your Agent Can Defend Itself Against Backdoor Attacks (arXiv:2506.08336)  \n  Rationale: Introduces “agentic” LLM scenarios where the model itself actively resists or detects backdoors, adding another layer to the defense conversation.\n\n• Robust Anti‐Backdoor Instruction Tuning in LVLMs (arXiv:2506.05401)  \n  Rationale: Examines instruction‐tuned large vision‐language models (LVLMs) specifically. Techniques here help students learn how to incorporate robust tuning strategies that counter poisoning and backdoor triggers.\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nHOW TO USE THIS SEQUENCE\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n• Start by establishing fundamentals with the systematic reviews and conceptual pieces. \n• Move onto the major categories of attacks: LLM backdoors, VLM‐specific vulnerabilities, and RAG‐targeted techniques. Each of these domains introduces unique ways adversaries inject malicious behaviors.  \n• Conclude with defense mechanisms, from self‐defending agents to specialized anti‐backdoor strategies during instruction or multi‐modal finetuning.\n\nIn combination, these papers provide both breadth (covering different architectures and threat models) and depth (from gradient‐based attacks to stealthy, patch‐level vulnerabilities). By the end, students should have a strong understanding of (1) how backdoor and poisoning attacks manifest, (2) how they differ across LLM, VLM, and RAG paradigms, and (3) what research‐grade defense strategies look like in cutting‐edge systems.",

Critical Analysis & Future Directions\n\n• Synthesize the literature and research findings:  \n – How is stealth achieved in these attacks and what detection methods are promising?  \n – What regulatory, operational, or design changes might be recommended for practitioners?  \n – Investigate open questions and future research avenues (e.g., dynamic defenses, robust training under adversarial conditions).\n\n• Final Project or Case Study:  \n – Have students pick one research paper (from the list) to analyze in-depth.  \n – They could run simulations, critique methods, or propose innovative defenses.\n\n──────────────────────────────\n8. Capstone Projects and Presentations\n\n• Encourage students to integrate what they’ve learned by designing experiments or proposing novel defenses against poisoning/backdoor attacks.  \n – Optionally, host a mini-seminar where each group presents their findings or defenses.\n\n──────────────────────────────\nOverall Notes\n\n• Throughout, interleave theoretical lectures with practical examples and active discussions.  \n• Encourage critical reading of the provided research to not only understand how attacks work but also why each method is designed in a specific way.  \n• Highlight that advances in attacks spur advances in defenses, and vice versa, reinforcing the arms race nature of security research.\n\nThis progression ties together the provided research—beginning with broad foundational ideas then moving into domain-specific details (LLMs, VLMs, RAG) and concluding with defense strategies and critical analysis—which gives students a well-rounded, up-to-date view of poisoning and backdoor challenges in modern ML systems.",

The studies you’ve listed (spanning attacks, defenses, and empirical evaluations) can inform each step.\n\n──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n1) Define Scope & Objectives\n──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n• Specify the goal of the elicitation: Clarify whether you want to identify potential backdoor attack vectors, quantify risks of data poisoning, or evaluate effectiveness of mitigation strategies.  \n• Identify target models: LLMs, VLMs, or retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems. Each category (e.g., code LLMs vs. multimodal LLMs) might have distinct threat surfaces.  \n• Determine the output: Is it a qualitative risk ranking, quantitative probabilities of backdoor success, or recommended controls?\n\nTip: Draw on the papers for category-specific objectives. For instance, if you are focusing on RAG attacks, see “Benchmarking Poisoning Attacks against Retrieval-Augmented Generation” and “CPA-RAG” to understand key threat factors.\n\n──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n2) Identify Experts & Elicitation Format\n──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n• Select expert panel: Include researchers or practitioners who have published on backdoor attacks (e.g., from “Finetuning-Activated Backdoors in LLMs”) or who have security experience with large-scale AI systems.  \n• Prepare the elicitation method: Common approaches include structured interviews, Delphi studies, or pairwise comparison surveys.  \n• Provide reading materials & context: Share relevant papers about subcategories of attacks (stealthy triggers, RAG-based poisoning, model patch aggregation) so experts have a consistent baseline.\n\nTip: For model-merging risk (from “Merge Hijacking”), seek cryptography or ML framework experts who understand the nuances of partial merges of large models.\n\n──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n3) Develop Threat & Attack Scenarios\n──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n• Threat modeling: Highlight different forms of “backdoor triggers” (in text, in images, or in code). Include both “traditional” visible triggers and “stealthy” or “semantic” triggers (as referenced in “Backdoor Attack on Vision Language Models with Stealthy Semantic Manipulation”).  \n• Attack vectors to consider:\n  – Data poisoning attacks that manipulate training sets or external knowledge sources (key references: “Joint-GCG,” “Spa-VLM”).  \n  – Post-hoc or during-finetuning backdoors (key references: “Finetuning-Activated Backdoors in LLMs,” “Backdoor Cleaning without External Guidance in MLLM Fine-tuning”).  \n  – Model merging or checkpoint tampering threats (“Merge Hijacking”).  \n• Define infiltration strategy: e.g., “covert” vs. “overt” poisoning, or clean-label vs. dirty-label approaches.\n\nTip: Use the “Stealthy Poisoning” references (Spa-VLM, “Through the Stealth Lens,” “Covert Poisoning Attacks on Retrieval-Augmented Generation”) to guide scenario design where triggers or malicious data remain hidden from normal detection.\n\n──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n4) Collect Expert Judgments\n──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n• Present scenarios: Provide a concise description of each potential threat scenario, referencing relevant studies (e.g., “Robust Anti-Backdoor Instruction Tuning in LVLMs” in case of instruction-tuned models).  \n• Obtain structured estimates: Ask your panel to estimate likelihood and potential impact (e.g., on a scale from “low” to “catastrophic”).  \n• Facilitate discussion for clarifications: Ensure each domain expert clarifies the assumptions behind their judgments (e.g., model size, control over the training pipeline, budget for the attacker).\n\nTip: You can use a Delphi method—collect anonymous individual responses, share an aggregate summary, then allow revising opinions based on group feedback.\n\n──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n5) Aggregate Findings & Analyze Sensitivity\n──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n• Aggregate risk scores: Combine likelihood and impact assessments to produce a final risk ranking or a distribution.  \n• Sensitivity analysis: Determine how changes in assumptions (e.g., attacker access, scale of model, quality controls) affect overall risk.  \n• Compare to existing defenses: If experts anticipate high likelihood in scenarios, investigate which known defenses (e.g., from “Your Agent Can Defend Itself against Backdoor Attacks” or “Backdoor Cleaning without External Guidance…”) mitigate or reduce risk.\n\nTip: For code LLMs specifically, incorporate factors found in “Which Factors Make Code LLMs More Vulnerable to Backdoor Attacks?” to see how the model’s domain, training strategy, or usage patterns might shift the overall risk.\n\n──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n6) Report & Review\n──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n• Synthesize results: Present the key insights from experts, including the highest-risk scenarios, probable triggers, and which mitigations are deemed most effective or easiest to implement.  \n• Document assumptions & limitations: Note the boundaries (e.g., the model’s scale, whether open- or closed-source was considered, which user-level defenses were assumed).  \n• Plan next steps: Decide on immediate mitigations and propose future lines of research—potentially re-eliciting expert views as new backdoor/poisoning approaches appear.\n\nTip: Some studies like “VLMs Can Aggregate Scattered Training Patches” highlight novel vulnerabilities you’ll want to keep an eye on, especially if training data spans distributed or uncurated sources.\n\n──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nSummary\n──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nExpert elicitation for poison/backdoor risk in LLMs/VLMs typically involves:\n1. Defining the scope of the threat assessment.  \n2. Convening the right set of domain experts.  \n3. Crafting scenarios that reflect distinct attack/defense strategies from recent literature.  \n4. Gathering structured estimates of likelihood and impact.  \n5. Analyzing and reporting aggregated judgments, including sensitivity analyses and recommended defenses.\n\nEach reference you provided can inform the scenario design, key vulnerabilities, and potential mitigations. By following a structured approach (e.g., Delphi or structured interviews), you can produce a robust, evidence-based risk assessment tailored to these emerging backdoor and poisoning challenges.",

          "response": "Here's a high‐level process that you can follow when assessing risks related to poisoning and backdoor attacks in models like LLMs, VLMs, RAG systems, and agent-based architectures. This process is designed to combine a thorough review of the literature (as in the list you provided) with expert elicitation methods and structured risk assessment techniques:\n\n1. Define the Scope and Objectives  \n • Clarify which systems, architectures, datasets, and model configurations (e.g., retrieval-augmented generation, vision-language models, multi-modal learning) you’re targeting.  \n • Specify the kinds of attacks under study (poisoning versus backdoor, covert versus active, post-deployment versus training-time manipulations, etc.).  \n • Determine the key risk dimensions (e.g., likelihood, impact on performance or ethics, severity, stealth, and propagation through model updates).\n\n2. Conduct a Comprehensive Literature Review  \n • Gather and review the latest research (like the 14 papers you've listed) to understand state-of-the-art attack methods and emerging trends.  \n • Extract details such as attack vectors, threat models, and defense strategies proposed or evaluated in these studies.  \n • Identify gaps and uncertainties in the current understanding of these risks.\n\n3. Develop a Threat Model and Risk Metric Framework  \n • Map out all potential attack surfaces and entry points, considering both data poisoning and backdoor insertion techniques.  \n • Define criteria for evaluating risk—this could include qualitative scales (e.g., low, moderate, high) or quantitative scores (likelihood × impact).  \n • Account for factors like the attacker’s resources, the stealthiness of an attack, and propagation risks within interconnected model pipelines.\n\n4. Design Expert Elicitation Methodology  \n • Identify relevant experts including researchers, practitioners, security analysts, and model developers with experience in model safety and adversarial attacks.  \n • Choose elicitation methods such as structured interviews, surveys, or Delphi panels which allow experts to provide ratings, insights, and confidence intervals.  \n • Prepare briefing materials summarizing the current literature, potential threat scenarios, and risk dimensions so all participants are on the same page.\n\n5. Conduct the Elicitation Process  \n • Run interviews or surveys that ask experts to evaluate the probability and impact of various attack scenarios.  \n • Use elicitation techniques that help mitigate biases (for example, anonymous surveys or iterative Delphi rounds for convergence).  \n • Gather qualitative insights on novel attack vectors and defense gaps not yet covered in the literature.\n\n6. Synthesize and Quantify Risk Assessments  \n • Aggregate expert inputs to build a risk matrix or model that identifies the most critical vulnerabilities and likely successful attack scenarios.  \n • Where possible, calibrate risk scores against real-world attack examples or simulations as described in some of the reviewed literature.  \n • Identify areas with high uncertainty that might need further research or real-world testing.\n\n7. Evaluate Defensive Measures and Mitigation Strategies  \n • Review the countermeasures cited in the literature (for example, robust anti-backdoor instruction tuning, covert poisoning detection, and finetuning-activated backdoor cleaning).  \n • Analyze their effectiveness, scalability, and practicality based on both literature review and expert judgment.  \n • Recommend best practices, guidelines, or new areas of investigation for safeguarding against these threats.\n\n8. Document the Process and Findings  \n • Clearly record the elicitation methodology, sources reviewed, expert responses, and the assumptions made during risk modeling.  \n • Clearly delineate the level of confidence in each of the risk estimates and provide transparency about uncertainties.  \n • Prepare recommendations for both short-term and longer-term defensive strategies, along with suggested monitoring and further research directions.\n\n9. Iterate and Update  \n • Recognize that both the threat landscape and defenses evolve over time.  \n • Plan for periodic review and update of the risk assessment process as new research emerges (as seen by ongoing studies/monthly updates) and as systems are updated or deployed widely.\n\nThis structured process combines both a systematic review of cutting-edge research and the direct input of recognized experts.

This could involve a combination of individual interviews, group discussions, and/or surveys. Clearly define the goals, scope, and format of the elicitation.\n\n3. **Prepare Elicitation Materials**: Compile relevant background information, including summaries of the key papers, to provide context for the experts. Develop a set of well-defined questions or topics to guide the discussion, such as:\n   - Current state of the art in poison and backdoor attacks against LLMs and VLMs\n   - Vulnerabilities and risk factors that make models more susceptible to such attacks\n   - Potential defense mechanisms and their effectiveness\n   - Emerging trends and future developments in this area\n\n4. **Conduct Elicitation Sessions**: Engage the experts in the elicitation process, whether through individual interviews, group discussions, or a combination. Encourage them to share their insights, experiences, and assessments of the current and future landscape.\n\n5. **Synthesize and Analyze Responses**: Carefully review and analyze the input received from the experts. Look for common themes, divergent opinions, and areas of uncertainty. Identify any key takeaways or consensus views that emerge from the elicitation.\n\n6. **Document Findings**: Prepare a comprehensive report that summarizes the elicitation process, the expert inputs, and the key findings. This report should provide a clear and actionable assessment of the current state of poison and backdoor attacks against LLMs and VLMs, as well as potential future developments and mitigation strategies.\n\n7. **Validate and Iterate**: Consider sharing the draft report with the participating experts to ensure the accurate representation of their views. Incorporate any feedback or additional insights, and refine the report as necessary.\n\n8. **Disseminate Findings**: Share the final report with relevant stakeholders, such as the research community, AI developers, and policymakers. This can help inform ongoing efforts to address the challenges of poison and backdoor attacks in the AI ecosystem.\n\nThe goal of this expert elicitation process is to gather informed perspectives from domain experts to enhance your understanding of the current state of the art, emerging trends, and potential mitigation strategies regarding poison and backdoor attacks on LLMs and VLMs. The insights gained can inform your own risk assessment and decision-making processes.",

Although each paper addresses different angles or specific scenarios (e.g., vision‑language vs. text‑only, RAG vs. standard LLMs, or code LLMs), they typically converge on the following themes:\n\n1) Attack Strategies and Mechanisms\n• Data Poisoning and Trigger Insertion: Injecting malicious examples or “trigger” tokens/patterns into training data or model‑merging procedures so that the model learns hidden associations.  \n• Model‑Merging Exploits: Exploiting the “merging” or combination of partially trained models (e.g., Merge Hijacking) as a new vector for delivering hidden backdoors.  \n• Gradient‑Based/White‑Box Attacks: Using knowledge of model internals to carefully craft poisoned data that steers parameters toward malicious goals.  \n• Stealthiness and Semantic Manipulation: Ensuring triggers remain hidden (e.g., small or visually unnoticeable patches, subtle textual phrases, or “benign appearing” code modifications).\n\n2) Vulnerabilities in Different Architectures\n• Large Language Models (LLMs): Traditional generative text models can carry hidden triggers that, when prompted, yield malicious or undesired completions.  \n• Vision‑Language Models (VLMs): Jointly trained models that can learn from multi‑modal data, making them susceptible to visually subtle patches or textual triggers.  \n• Code LLMs: Specialized LLMs trained on code can exhibit unique backdoor behaviors (e.g., triggered code completions), sometimes more vulnerable than general text models.  \n• Retrieval‑Augmented Generation (RAG): Systems that rely on external knowledge sources have an extra “injection surface” (the retrieval corpus) through which an attacker can insert stealthy or malicious text.\n\n3) Backdoor Activation and Trigger Types\n• Static vs. Dynamic Triggers: Some triggers (e.g., special tokens) remain static; others adapt to context, often embedding themselves in ways that appear natural or semantically aligned.  \n• Fine‑Tuning and Post‑Training Activation: Even if a backdoor is not active in the base model, certain fine‑tuning procedures can “activate” or amplify latent backdoors.  \n• Sparse vs. Aggregated Triggers: Multiple scattered “patches” in the training data can be aggregated by the model, collectively forming an effective trigger mechanism.\n\n4) Defense and Mitigation Approaches\n• Backdoor Detection: Identifying anomalous behaviors (e.g., analyzing how models respond to sets of inputs, searching for suspicious neurons or subspaces).  \n• Robust or “Clean” Fine‑Tuning: Strategies to sanitize training data or adopt training/fine‑tuning schemes that reduce hidden triggers (e.g., removing suspect inputs, adopting specialized regularization).  \n• Model Surgery and “Cleaning”: Techniques to remove or neutralize backdoors from an already trained model—sometimes without external guidance or knowledge of triggers.  \n• Prompt‑Level Defense: In RAG or agent‑based LLM systems, specialized “guardian” prompts or monitors can short‑circuit attempts to trigger backdoors at runtime.\n\n5) Stealth and Evasion Tactics\n• Low Perceptual Footprint: Making sure triggers are small, distributed, or practically invisible to manual inspection (e.g., minor text changes or subtle image patches).  \n• Semantic Consistency: Using content that aligns with the domain so it does not appear obviously out of place in the training corpus (e.g., domain‑relevant tokens).  \n• Evasive Prompting Patterns: Designing triggers that do not stand out in typical text analysis but still produce a hidden effect when embedded in a prompt.\n\n6) System‑Level Implications\n• Practical RAG Scenarios: Poisoning or backdooring the retrieval component can alter the knowledge “retrieved,” leading to misinformation or undesired completions without modifying the base model itself.  \n• Multi‑Agent Environments: Exploiting or defending entire agent pipelines (where one LLM calls another) requires not only local detection but also robust chain‑of‑thought scrutiny.  \n• Broader Ecosystem Risks: When backdoored models propagate (through open‑source release, model sharing, or merging), the malicious payload can persist and even evolve.\n\nTogether, these elements define the landscape of poisoning and backdoor attacks/defenses in large (multi)modal models. In designing a theoretical model, one typically considers (1) how triggers are inserted or learned, (2) how covertly they operate, (3) how model architectures and training pipelines can be exploited, and (4) what methods can mitigate or remove these threats.",

          "response": "Based on the literature you provided, a coherent theoretical model for “B3. Poison & Backdoor” attacks should incorporate several core elements. These elements capture both the adversary’s strategies and the system’s vulnerabilities, along with the corresponding defense mechanisms. Here’s a breakdown:\n\n1. Attack Vectors and Taxonomy  \n • Poisoning vs. Backdoor:  \n  – Poisoning often involves injecting malicious or misleading data during training or updating, thereby “poisoning” the model’s knowledge.  \n  – Backdoor attacks, in contrast, implant hidden triggers or mechanisms during training that activate under specific conditions (often stealthily embedded so that the model appears normal until triggered).  \n • Classification by Model Modality and Architecture:  \n  – Different types of models (e.g., Large Language Models (LLMs), Vision Language Models (VLMs), Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems, and agent-based systems) have distinct vulnerabilities and require tailored threat models.\n\n2. Attack Mechanisms and Techniques  \n • Gradient-Based and Finetuning Attacks:  \n  – Techniques such as unified gradient-based methods (Joint-GCG) show how subtle gradients can be exploited to alter model behavior through poisoning.  \n  – Finetuning-activated backdoors illustrate that even post-training processes can inadvertently activate malicious behaviors.  \n • Stealth and Semantic Manipulation:  \n  – Some attacks rely on stealthy semantic manipulation so that the backdoor remains hidden in the model’s normal operation.  \n  – Approaches like “Merge Hijacking” demonstrate that more complex interactions (e.g., model merging) can be exploited if not carefully safeguarded.\n\n3. Model Vulnerabilities and Risk Factors  \n • Aggregation vulnerabilities:  \n  – In VLMs, dispersed information from training patches may be subtly aggregated, making it easier for adversaries to implant or activate a backdoor.  \n • Code and Task-Specific Vulnerabilities:  \n  – Certain types of models (e.g., code LLMs) have been systematically studied to understand what factors render them particularly vulnerable to backdoor insertion.\n\n4. Defense Strategies and Countermeasures  \n • Robust Anti-Backdoor Instruction Tuning:  \n  – Proactive tuning methods that aim to detect and counteract backdoor behaviors during model training or refinement.  \n • Self-Defensive Mechanisms:  \n  – Some approaches focus on letting the agent or system use internal checks to recognize and neutralize backdoor triggers in real time.  \n • Backdoor Cleaning During Finetuning:  \n  – Strategies that attempt to “clean” or remove already embedded backdoor patterns without the need for external guidance, especially relevant for multi-modal models.\n\n5. Evaluation and Benchmarking  \n • Metrics and Systematic Reviews:  \n  – A critical element is the set of evaluation strategies that compare attack efficacy (stealth, activation rate, impact on performance) and defense success.  \n  – Benchmarking the poisoning/backdoor resilience across different systems (LLM, VLM, RAG) is necessary for a systematic understanding of vulnerabilities.\n\nIn summary, the theoretical model should capture:  \n – The dual nature of the attacks (direct poisoning vs. hidden backdoors),  \n – The specific techniques adversaries use (gradient-based, semantic, finetuning-activated, merging strategies),  \n – The nuances of various model architectures and their vulnerabilities, and  \n – Integrated defense/detection mechanisms alongside robust evaluation protocols.\n\nThese elements together provide a robust framework for understanding and analyzing both the methods of attack and the potential paths for defense in modern large-scale language and vision-language systems.",

The references below (though they appear set in 2025) highlight the breadth of techniques, targets, and mitigation approaches around backdoors and poisoning.\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n1. Poisoning & Backdoor Attacks: Core Ideas\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n• Poisoning Attacks: An adversary manipulates the training data or model parameters so that, at inference time, the system behaves incorrectly or produces adversary-chosen outputs when triggered by a specific cue. \n• Backdoor Attacks: A specialized subset of poisoning attacks where the model is trained to respond in a certain way to a secret “trigger” (e.g., a particular token or pattern). In normal usage (without the trigger), the model’s performance may appear unaffected.\n\nIn the context of large language and vision-language models:\n• Fine-tuning and instruction tuning pipelines are targets for backdoors: Attackers can inject seemingly benign data or hidden triggers that remain latent until deployed. \n• Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) introduces additional vectors for poisoning: Attackers can plant malicious documents or indices that lead to manipulated model outputs.\n\nBelow, the listed papers provide deeper perspectives on stealth techniques, vulnerabilities associated with advanced model architectures, and methods for detecting or defending against backdoor/poison attacks.\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n2. Recent Advances & Highlights\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n\nA.

A Systematic Study (2025/06):\n  – Investigates the structural or data characteristics that cause code-generation LLMs to be more susceptible to backdoors.\n  – Suggests best practices for training code-centric models more safely.\n\n• Merge Hijacking: Backdoor Attacks to Model Merging of Large Language Models (2025/05):\n  – Shows how malicious actors can exploit model merging (a technique used to combine multiple LLM checkpoints) to implant stealthy backdoors.\n  – Discusses potential guidelines to guard merges.\n\n• Finetuning-Activated Backdoors in LLMs (2025/05):\n  – Examines how the finetuning step (often performed by third parties) can activate latent backdoors in a pre-trained base model. \n  – Recommends pre- and post-finetuning checks for suspicious behavior.\n\nB. Poisoning & Backdoor Attacks in Vision-Language Models (VLMs)\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n• Backdoor Attack on Vision Language Models with Stealthy Semantic Manipulation (2025/06):\n  – Explores the use of subtle text-image triggers for multi-modal backdoor attacks. \n  – Emphasizes “stealth”—making the triggers unobtrusive and semantically plausible.\n\n• VLMs Can Aggregate Scattered Training Patches (2025/06):\n  – Investigates how small (possibly malicious) patches can be distributed across training data, yet aggregated by VLMs into a meaningful attack vector.\n\n• Backdoor Cleaning without External Guidance in MLLM Fine-tuning (2025/05):\n  – Presents a framework to eliminate or reduce backdoors in multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) during finetuning, without relying on external “clean” data.\n\nC. Poisoning & Backdoor in Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n• Joint-GCG: Unified Gradient-Based Poisoning Attacks on Retrieval-Augmented Generation Systems (2025/06):\n  – Outlines a gradient-based approach to inject malicious content in the retrieval index or in the training data for an end-to-end RAG system.\n\n• Through the Stealth Lens: Rethinking Attacks and Defenses in RAG (2025/06):\n  – Describes stealth-oriented attacks on RAG pipelines (e.g., planted documents that slip through typical detection) and proposes new defense mechanisms.\n\n• Spa-VLM: Stealthy Poisoning Attacks on RAG-based VLM (2025/05):\n  – Introduces a specialized approach for planting malicious elements in the retrieval mechanism of a vision-language system. \n  – Highlights the interplay between vision-language features and textual retrieval.\n\n• Benchmarking Poisoning Attacks against Retrieval-Augmented Generation (2025/05):\n  – Compares how different poisoning strategies perform against a range of RAG architectures and data settings.\n  – Proposes standard metrics to assess stealth and efficacy.\n\n• CPA-RAG: Covert Poisoning Attacks on Retrieval-Augmented Generation in Large Language Models (2025/05):\n  – Presents “covert” poisoning methods that seek to evade detection during indexing or content curation. \n  – Demonstrates how destructive these attacks can be if the retrieval corpus is unmonitored.\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n3. Emerging Themes and Defenses\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n• Stealth: Many attacks aim to remain hidden or “innocuous” until triggered. Both data-level stealth (hiding triggers in seemingly harmless content) and parameter-level stealth (embedding triggers as subtle weight changes) are explored.  \n• Multi-step Attack Vectors: Particularly in RAG systems, malicious data can be slipped into the retrieval corpus or the model’s training/fine-tuning pipeline, then later exploited via triggers.  \n• Preventive Measures & Detection:  \n  – Regular scanning of training data, especially from external sources.  \n  – Model-level anomaly detection (e.g., scanning for unusual gradients or trigger activations).  \n  – Fine-tuning hygiene: verifying stable performance on multiple triggers prior to deployment.  \n  – Post-hoc cleaning strategies leveraging authenticity or consistency checks.  \n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n4. Informed Decision-Making: Key Takeaways\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n• Know your supply chain: Whether you are assembling LLM checkpoints or adding RAG modules, each step can be an entry point for poisoning. \n• Continuous Monitoring: Updated detection tools that check for suspicious patterns or performance anomalies (both in text- or image-based tasks) can help detect backdoors. \n• Defense in Depth: Combining multiple defenses—data vetting, robust training, model and corpus scanning—provides stronger protection than relying on a single mechanism. \n• Thorough Testing: Pre-deployment testing involving potential triggers or suspicious tokens/patches helps catch hidden vulnerabilities.\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n\nThis overview underscores how widely poisoning and backdoor vulnerabilities affect modern AI systems—spanning text, vision, and multimodal tasks—especially when augmented with external retrieval corpora. Bringing awareness, verifying data, and employing robust training and monitoring strategies are essential to safeguarding systems against these threats.",

          "response": "Below is a summary and synthesis of the key concepts behind the B3 “Poison & Backdoor” category that participants should grasp for the exercise:\n\n1. What “Poison & Backdoor” Encompasses  \n • This category covers methods where adversaries either “poison” the training data or inject hidden triggers (“backdoors”) so that models behave undesirably under specific conditions.  \n • Attackers may target different systems—for example, pure large language models (LLMs), vision language models (VLMs), or hybrid architectures like retrieval-augmented generation (RAG).\n\n2. Types of Attacks Highlighted  \n • Stealthy Poisoning Attacks: Some works (e.g., Spa-VLM, CPA-RAG) describe injecting subtle changes into the training data so that the model learns harmful associations without obvious anomalies during routine evaluation.  \n • Backdoor Attacks: Studies such as “Backdoor Attack on Vision Language Models with Stealthy Semantic Manipulation” illustrate how adversaries can embed triggers that activate covert, malicious behaviors.  \n • Merging and Fine-Tuning Attacks: Research like “Merge Hijacking: Backdoor Attacks to Model Merging” and “Finetuning-Activated Backdoors in LLMs” expands the threat scope to when models are updated or combined.\n\n3. Defense Strategies and Countermeasures  \n • Some works focus on robust training or tuning procedures to reduce the risk of backdoors—for example, “Robust Anti-Backdoor Instruction Tuning in LVLMs” and “Your Agent Can Defend Itself against Backdoor Attacks.”  \n • “Backdoor Cleaning without External Guidance in MLLM Fine-tuning” suggests methodologies for removing backdoors once they’ve been injected, a critical step in defense.\n\n4. Model-Specific & System Differences  \n • The tags (LLM, VLM, RAG, Agent, etc.) indicate that attacks—and therefore defenses—might differ significantly depending on the underlying architecture.  \n  – For instance, VLMs might be more vulnerable to covert visual or semantics-based backdoor triggers.  \n  – RAG systems face unique risks because of the blend of retrieval and generative components, as seen in multiple works addressing poisoning in these systems.\n\n5. Systematic Reviews and Vulnerability Studies  \n • There are comprehensive analyses and reviews (e.g., systematic review of poisoning attacks, studies on code LLM vulnerabilities) that help in mapping out common attack vectors, risks, and mitigation strategies.  \n • These studies provide valuable context for understanding not only the technical mechanisms behind these attacks but also the practical impact on real-world applications.\n\n6. Implications for Decision Making  \n • Understanding these attack techniques is critical for assessing system risks, planning defenses, and preparing incident response plans.  \n • Participants should be ready to evaluate risk trade-offs: How might subtle training or fine-tuning adjustments expose systems? What detection or recovery mechanisms can be effectively implemented given constraints on computational resources or model complexity?  \n • For tabletop exercises, informed decision-making means considering both proactive defenses (resilient training strategies) and reactive responses (backdoor detection and cleaning).\n\nIn summary, by studying these works, participants will appreciate that modern models—whether language-only, vision-language, or retrieval-augmented—are susceptible to sophisticated poisoning and backdoor threats. The exercise calls for a nuanced understanding of the interplay between attack strategies and defense mechanisms, which is critical for devising effective risk mitigation and response plans.",

What are they?\n\nLet's break down the \"rules\" or underlying principles governing how these papers are grouped, tagged, and presented:\n\n---\n\n## 1. Topical Grouping: \"Poison & Backdoor\"\nAll included works address **poisoning attacks** or **backdoor vulnerabilities** in large AI models. This means:\n- How malicious data or triggers can be used to manipulate model behavior (poisoning/backdoor).\n- How such attacks are performed, detected, or mitigated.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Chronological Organization\nEach entry starts with a date in the format `[YYYY/MM]`, and the list is ordered **newest first** (June 2025 to May 2025).\n\n---\n\n## 3. Paper Citation Structure\nEach entry follows this consistent format:\n- **[Title](arxiv-link)** [with possible conference tag]\n- ![TAG](...) badges indicating the paper's relevant domains or features.\n\n---\n\n## 4. Tagging Rules (Badges)\nEach paper is tagged according to the **model type** or **system** it focuses on:\n- ![LLM](https://img.shields.io/badge/LLM-589cf4): Large Language Model\n- ![VLM](https://img.shields.io/badge/VLM-c7688b): Vision Language Model\n- ![RAG](https://img.shields.io/badge/RAG-87b800): Retrieval-Augmented Generation system\n- ![Agent](https://img.shields.io/badge/Agent-87b800): Agent-based system (e.g., autonomous AI agents)\n- ![ACL'25_Main](https://img.shields.io/badge/ACL'25_Main-f1b800): Accepted at ACL 2025 main conference\n- Other badges may indicate **special focus** or **conference venue**.\n\n**Rule:** Each paper receives badges that succinctly summarize which models, systems, or venues the research targets.\n\n---\n\n## 5. Function: How These Rules Serve the Reader\n\n- **Topical grouping** quickly shows the reader all papers relevant to a specific security threat.\n- **Chronological order** makes it easy to see recent trends and progress.\n- **Consistent formatting** allows for easy scanning and parsing (by humans and scripts).\n- **Badges** let readers identify at a glance which sub-area (e.g., LLM, VLM, RAG) a paper belongs to, supporting efficient filtering or review.\n\n---\n\n## 6. Rationale for \"Different Rules\"\nEach function (grouping, ordering, tagging, etc.) follows its \"own rule\":\n- **Grouping**: By attack type (poison/backdoor).\n- **Ordering**: By date (descending).\n- **Tagging**: By model/system/venue, using badges.\n- **Citation**: Always links to arXiv, with optional conference tags.\n\n---\n\n**Summary Table of Rules:**\n\n| Rule Type           | Rule Description                                                    |\n|---------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Grouping            | All papers about poisoning/backdoor in AI models                    |\n| Chronological Order | Newest papers first                                                 |\n| Citation Format     | `[Date] [Title](arxiv-link) [badges]`                               |\n| Badging             | Tag by model type (LLM/VLM/RAG/etc.) and sometimes venue            |\n| Function            | Enables fast topical surveying, sorting, and filtering for readers  |\n\n---\n\n**In short:**  \nEach entry's formatting and tagging serves a distinct function—grouping by topic, sorting by date, tagging by model/system—to maximize clarity and navigability for researchers tracking advances in poisoning/backdoor attacks and defenses in AI.",

In essence, each paper proposes or analyzes an attack or defense that operates under distinctive assumptions about what the adversary can do, what the defender can detect, and how the language/vision/retrieval systems respond when compromised or protected.\n\n1) Robust Anti-Backdoor Instruction Tuning in LVLMs  \n   • What it is: Proposes methods to “inoculate” large vision-language models (LVLMs) via specialized instruction tuning.  \n   • Rules it follows:  \n       – Defense is integrated into the model’s instruction-tuning process, making the final model robust against typical backdoor triggers.  \n       – Emphasizes minimal performance degradation on benign tasks while excising the planted backdoor behavior.\n\n2) Joint-GCG: Unified Gradient-Based Poisoning Attacks on Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) Systems  \n   • What it is: Introduces a joint optimization that poisons both the retriever and the generator.  \n   • Rules it follows:  \n       – The attacker shapes gradients so that the retrieved content and the generation both yield the attacker’s chosen outputs.  \n       – Relies on multiple training passes where malicious data and gradient signals subtly co-opt the model.\n\n3) Backdoor Attack on Vision Language Models with Stealthy Semantic Manipulation  \n   • What it is: A stealthy attack that injects “semantic triggers”—conceptual patterns rather than obvious data artifacts—into training.  \n   • Rules it follows:  \n       – Triggers overlap with natural concepts (e.g., certain words, images, or image-text alignments).  \n       – The model responds to these conceptual triggers in a malicious way only when a hidden cue is present; otherwise it performs normally.\n\n4) A Systematic Review of Poisoning Attacks Against Large Language Models  \n   • What it is: A broad survey that categorizes poisoning and backdoor attacks on LLMs.  \n   • Rules it follows:  \n       – Consolidates known methods and highlights how each approach manipulates training corpora, model checkpoints, or parameter merging.  \n       – Examines real-world feasibility, stealthiness, and the trade-offs required by each attack strategy.\n\n5) Your Agent Can Defend Itself against Backdoor Attacks  \n   • What it is: Looks at an “auto-defensive” agent-based approach in which the LLM learns to detect and neutralize suspicious triggers in real time.  \n   • Rules it follows:  \n       – The LLM-based agent is given rules or heuristics to spot potential anomalies in context.  \n       – Defense is integrated at the inference stage via dynamic checking, rather than solely at training.\n\n6) Which Factors Make Code LLMs More Vulnerable to Backdoor Attacks? A Systematic Study  \n   • What it is: Specializes in backdoor vulnerabilities within code-oriented LLMs.  \n   • Rules it follows:  \n       – Probes the interplay of code tokenization, context length, and developer data contamination in “code models.”  \n       – Analyzes how certain code-specific triggers can remain undetected or be more effective once the model is integrated in developer pipelines.\n\n7) VLMs Can Aggregate Scattered Training Patches  \n   • What it is: Shows that vision-language models can inadvertently “stitch together” multiple, seemingly disjoint malicious patterns into a coherent backdoor trigger.  \n   • Rules it follows:  \n       – If a certain fraction of the training data is contaminated—even in small, scattered patches—the model can learn a hidden link among them.  \n       – Reflects the synergy between the vision and language modalities in inadvertently combining partial triggers.\n\n8) Through the Stealth Lens: Rethinking Attacks and Defenses in RAG  \n   • What it is: Uses a “stealth lens,” or viewpoint, to analyze how attackers can slip triggers into the retrieval component of a Retrieval-Augmented Generation system while evading conventional defenses.  \n   • Rules it follows:  \n       – Explores the vulnerability that each stage (retriever, ranker, generator) can be compromised to produce malicious content.  \n       – Highlights new defensive principles that require synergy between retrieval filtering and generation-level detection.\n\n9) Spa-VLM: Stealthy Poisoning Attacks on RAG-based VLM  \n   • What it is: Proposes a specialized poisoning method tailored to the dual nature of retrieval and generation in a vision-language pipeline.  \n   • Rules it follows:  \n       – Uses carefully planted text-image pairs in the retrieval database that remain innocuous in isolation.  \n       – Once retrieved in certain combinations, they induce the VLM to produce adversarial or manipulated outputs.\n\n10) Benchmarking Poisoning Attacks against Retrieval-Augmented Generation  \n   • What it is: Provides an end-to-end benchmark suite to test how well different RAG architectures withstand various poisoning injections.  \n   • Rules it follows:  \n       – Implements standardized measures of stealth, success rate, and model utility retention.  \n       – Encourages consistent comparisons across RAG-based LLMs to clarify key failure points and effective mitigations.\n\n11) CPA-RAG: Covert Poisoning Attacks on Retrieval-Augmented Generation in Large Language Models  \n   • What it is: Demonstrates “covert” poisoning that leverages domain shifts and subtle manipulations to remain undetected.  \n   • Rules it follows:  \n       – Focuses on infiltration of trainer data with domain-appropriate but malicious content.  \n       – Relies on the RAG pipeline’s difficulty in verifying authenticity of training references or knowledge bases.\n\n12) Merge Hijacking: Backdoor Attacks to Model Merging of Large Language Models  \n   • What it is: Exploits the practice of merging multiple LLM checkpoints (for efficiency or performance gains) to inject a backdoor.  \n   • Rules it follows:  \n       – Attack triggers slip in when two or more partially trained (or specialized) LLM weights are combined.  \n       – Relies on no single checkpoint raising alarm, but “merged” weights producing the attacker’s hidden payload.\n\n13) Finetuning-Activated Backdoors in LLMs  \n   • What it is: Investigates backdoors that lie dormant until a later finetuning stage.  \n   • Rules it follows:  \n       – The model is pretrained innocuously, but certain small parameter structures are primed to become malicious upon specific tuning updates.  \n       – Necessitates a two-stage process: planting a hidden mechanism during pretraining, then activating it under common finetuning practices.\n\n14) Backdoor Cleaning without External Guidance in MLLM Fine-tuning  \n   • What it is: Proposes a “self-cleaning” process that can remove malicious triggers in multimodal LLM (MLLM) fine-tuning without needing external labels or extra data.  \n   • Rules it follows:  \n       – Uses internal consistency checks or contrastive signals from the model’s multiple modalities to identify outlier behaviors.  \n       – Iteratively prunes or corrects parameters associated with suspicious triggers, neutralizing the backdoor while preserving legitimate functionality.\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nHOW THEY “FUNCTION ACCORDING TO DIFFERENT RULES”\n• Attack vs. Defense Context: Some papers detail how to embed a backdoor (attack rules), while others describe ways to detect or remove it (defense rules). \n• Stealth Strategies: Varying degrees of stealth and subtlety—some triggers are overt or rely on inserted tokens, others use conceptual or domain-specific cues. \n• Domain/Modality Focus: Code LLMs, RAG-based LLMs, and Vision-Language Models each have unique vulnerabilities (e.g., code syntax vs. textual references vs. cross-modal signals). \n• Activation Mechanism: Some backdoors activate under special prompts or during secondary finetuning, while others remain continuously present but hidden under normal usage. \n• Detection & Mitigation: Defenders may rely on data filtering, gradient auditing, model-internal consistency checks, or specialized fine-tuning to remove or block triggers.\n\nIn short, each work uses a unique set of assumptions about how an adversary can insert malicious content and how (and when) that content manifests. Likewise, each proposes different “rules” or protocols (for either attackers or defenders) that reflect the complexity and variety of large models—whether they are pure LLMs, code-focused LLMs, or multimodal (vision-language) systems.",

          "response": "These works all fall under the broad umbrella of “poisoning and backdoor” research for modern language and vision–language models—but they don’t all work by the same means. In other words, while they share a common goal (either to maliciously influence a model’s behavior or to defend against such influence), they “function” (or operate) according to different sets of rules that depend on the underlying attack or defense mechanism and on the model architecture being targeted. Here’s a rough breakdown of the different “rules” or operational modes represented:\n\n1. Attack versus defense approaches:\n • Some papers propose methods to insert backdoors or poison models at training time so that later on a secret trigger will cause a specific (often malicious) behavior. For example, those describing “backdoor attacks” or “finetuning-activated backdoors” work by modifying the model’s learned parameters with hidden instructions.\n • In contrast, other works focus on defending against malicious influences. For instance, “Robust Anti-Backdoor Instruction Tuning in LVLMs” or “Your Agent Can Defend Itself against Backdoor Attacks” develop techniques so that even if poisoned data or backdoor triggers have been introduced, the model can detect or neutralize them.\n\n2. Different target model types and modalities:\n • Some attacks and defenses are specifically designed for large language models (LLMs). Papers like “A Systematic Review of Poisoning Attacks Against Large Language Models” or those examining vulnerabilities in code LLMs focus on text-only models.\n • Others are geared toward vision–language models (VLMs), which must account for multi-modal data (e.g., “Backdoor Attack on Vision Language Models with Stealthy Semantic Manipulation”)—here the “rules” of engagement have to consider both how visual and textual information can be manipulated.\n • A third group targets hybrid or retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems—models that rely on external context or data retrieval. Tools like “Joint-GCG: Unified Gradient-Based Poisoning Attacks on Retrieval-Augmented Generation Systems” and “CPA-RAG: Covert Poisoning Attacks on Retrieval-Augmented Generation in Large Language Models” are designed with the rules (i.e., operational constraints and vulnerabilities) specific to systems that combine generative and retrieval-based components.\n\n3. Modes of execution and technical mechanisms:\n • Poisoning attacks are often “gradient-based” or even “patch aggregation” methods where small, often imperceptible changes are blended into training data to affect model behavior over time.\n • Backdoor techniques might rely on embedding specific triggers—be they in the code, the fine-tuning process, or even as a byproduct of model merging (“Merge Hijacking”)—that remain dormant until activated by a particular prompt, input signal, or fine-tuning procedure.\n • On the defensive side, mitigating strategies may include robust fine-tuning, detection, or cleaning of backdoor components without external guidance to “purify” the model.\n\n4. Domain‐ and application-specific rules:\n • Some studies shine a light on how different tasks (e.g., code generation vs. general natural language processing) have their own “rules of vulnerability.” For example, studying which factors make code LLMs more vulnerable helps customize both attacks and defenses for that domain.\n • Similarly, work on agents or on RAG looks at how auxiliary components (like retrieval modules or decision‐making agents) can be exploited or can help counteract the threat.\n\nIn summary, while all these pieces of work deal with “poisoning” or introducing “backdoors” in modern AI models (or defending against them), they follow different rules in that:\n • Some are attack methodologies working via malicious data manipulation (structured as hidden triggers, gradient-based perturbations, or patch aggregations),\n • Others are defense mechanisms designed to detect, counteract, or “clean” such poisoning,\n • And the underlying techniques vary according to whether the target is a language model, a vision–language model, or a hybrid retrieval-augmented system.\n\nEach “rule set” is tailored to the vulnerabilities, interface, and training routines of the system it is meant to attack or protect.",

The rule seems to be that multimodal systems create additional attack surfaces through cross-modal manipulation.\n\n**RAG-Specific Vulnerabilities**: Retrieval-Augmented Generation systems follow rules where poisoned documents in the knowledge base can be strategically crafted to trigger malicious responses when retrieved, creating a \"time-delayed\" attack vector.\n\n## Defense Principles\n\n**Self-Defense Capability**: The paper \"Your Agent Can Defend Itself\" suggests AI agents can be designed with intrinsic defensive mechanisms, implying a rule where systems actively monitor and protect themselves.\n\n**Training-Time Hardening**: Robust anti-backdoor instruction tuning indicates defenses must be built into the training process rather than applied post-hoc.\n\n**External Guidance Independence**: Backdoor cleaning without external guidance suggests defensive systems should be self-sufficient and not rely on human intervention.\n\n## System-Specific Rules\n\n**Code LLMs**: Have unique vulnerability factors that differ from general-purpose models, suggesting specialized attack/defense paradigms.\n\n**Model Merging**: Creates new attack vectors where backdoors can be injected during the merging process itself.\n\n**Scattered Training**: VLMs can aggregate distributed malicious patches, indicating a cumulative vulnerability rule.\n\nThe overarching principle appears to be an arms race where attacks become increasingly sophisticated and stealthy, while defenses evolve toward autonomous, built-in protection mechanisms.",

          "response": "Certainly! For a journalistic piece covering the recent research on poisoning and backdoor attacks in large foundation models (especially LLMs, VLMs, RAG, and Agents), it’s crucial to set the context with the following background information:\n\n## 1. What Are Large Language and Vision-Language Models?\n- **Large Language Models (LLMs)**: AI systems trained on massive text datasets, capable of generating, summarizing, and answering questions in natural language (e.g., GPT-4, Llama).\n- **Vision-Language Models (VLMs)**: AI models that can jointly process images and text, enabling tasks like image captioning, visual question answering, and multimodal reasoning (e.g., CLIP, GPT-4V).\n- **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**: A popular technique where LLMs are enhanced by retrieving relevant external documents to ground their responses, improving accuracy and factuality.\n\n## 2. What Are Poisoning and Backdoor Attacks?\n- **Data Poisoning**: Attackers subtly manipulate a model’s training data to degrade performance or cause specific failures. Poisoned data might look normal but is designed to mislead or subvert the model during deployment.\n- **Backdoor Attacks**: A special form of poisoning where the attacker embeds hidden triggers in the data. When the model encounters a specific trigger pattern (e.g., a phrase, image, or code snippet), it behaves maliciously or in a predetermined way, while otherwise behaving normally.\n\n## 3. Why Are These Attacks Dangerous?\n- **Stealth**: Backdoors are often invisible during regular evaluations and only activate under specific circumstances.\n- **Scalability**: As models scale and are fine-tuned on user data, new attack vectors emerge, particularly for open-source and widely shared models.\n- **Transferability**: Poisoned or backdoored models can affect downstream applications, especially when models are merged, fine-tuned, or used in agents and RAG systems.\n\n## 4. Why Is This a Timely Issue?\n- **Rapid Adoption**: LLMs and VLMs are being deployed in critical domains (healthcare, law, education, etc.) and as autonomous agents.\n- **Community Concerns**: Growing research in 2024-2025 highlights new, more sophisticated attacks, as well as the challenges of detection and defense.\n- **Open-Source Ecosystem**: The trend toward open sharing of model weights and fine-tuning increases the risk of unnoticed, large-scale compromise.\n\n## 5. Defense and Mitigation Efforts\n- **Detection**: Developing techniques to identify poisoned or backdoored models or data.\n- **Robust Training**: Approaches to make models less sensitive to malicious data or triggers.\n- **Self-Defending Agents**: New research explores how agents themselves can recognize and resist backdoor activation.\n\n## 6. Notable Research Directions Highlighted in the List\n- **Benchmarks and Reviews**: Systematic reviews and benchmarks to understand the landscape and vulnerabilities.\n- **Novel Attacks**: Studies of new attack vectors, such as semantic manipulation, model merging, and covert poisoning in RAG systems.\n- **Defense Mechanisms**: Research on cleaning backdoors and robust instruction tuning without external guidance.\n\n---\n\n**In summary:**  \nTo cover this topic, your readers should understand what LLMs/VLMs and RAG systems are, how poisoning/backdoor attacks work, why they’re an urgent threat, and what the current research is doing to address both offensive and defensive aspects. This context will help readers appreciate the stakes and novelty in the 2025 research you’re referencing.",

          "response": "Below is some core background information that helps contextualize and understand these recent works on “poisoning” and “backdoor” attacks in large-scale AI models. You can view it as a starting point for a journalistic explainer.\n\n1) Key Terminology: Poisoning vs. Backdoor Attacks\n\n• Poisoning Attacks:  \n  – Poisoning (or data poisoning) introduces malicious patterns into a model’s training process—often by manipulating training samples—so that the trained model behaves incorrectly in a targeted or broad way.  \n  – Poisoning can aim to degrade overall performance (“availability poisoning”), or stealthily influence outputs on specific inputs (“integrity poisoning”).  \n\n• Backdoor Attacks:  \n  – Backdoor attacks inject hidden triggers into the model during training. Under normal circumstances, the model acts fine, but when it sees the trigger pattern, it produces attacker-chosen outcomes.  \n  – A “trigger” can be a special token in language models, or certain pixels/patterns in vision models. The main property is that the trigger is rarely encountered, so the malicious behavior is typically hidden.  \n\n2) Why Large Vision/Language Models Are Vulnerable\n\n• Data Scale and Opacity:  \n  – Modern models (Large Language Models, Vision-Language Models) are trained on massive datasets scraped from the internet or enterprise data silos. Validating the integrity of these datasets is extremely challenging.  \n  – The huge number of parameters makes it difficult to detect or interpret suspicious model behaviors.  \n\n• Wide Usage and Fine-Tuning:  \n  – Companies and developers often fine-tune or adapt a pre-trained foundation model for specific downstream tasks. A model with a backdoor might appear benign until a certain “trigger” input emerges in real-world usage.  \n  – Even lightly or partially fine-tuned large models are susceptible if the backdoor was set during pre-training (or introduced during the fine-tuning process itself).  \n\n3) Types of Backdoor and Poisoning Scenarios\n\n• Training Data Poisoning:  \n  – Attackers can slip malicious examples into the training corpus. These examples embed special triggers (e.g., a rare word) that, when encountered at test time, produce attacker-specified outputs.  \n\n• Model Merging Backdoors:  \n  – Researchers commonly merge or combine multiple model checkpoints (e.g., to get “the best of both worlds”). Attackers could manipulate one checkpoint so that merging unwittingly imports a hidden backdoor.  \n\n• Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) Poisoning:  \n  – RAG systems retrieve external documents, then feed them into a large model for final generation. Poisoning the retrieval corpus can stealthily influence the text or facts the model sees.  \n\n• Stealthy or Covert Attacks:  \n  – Malicious changes are subtle so as not to break overall performance or raise obvious red flags. For instance, an inserted “trigger token” that’s misspelled or extremely rare is less likely to be spotted.  \n\n4) Observed or Potential Harms\n\n• Misinformation and Disinformation:  \n  – A backdoor could push a language model to generate incorrect or manipulative content specifically when asked about certain topics.  \n\n• Code Vulnerabilities:  \n  – With code-generating LLMs, a backdoor could cause unsafe code recommendations upon special prompts, leading to security flaws.  \n\n• Undermining Trust in AI Tools:  \n  – If organizations cannot confirm that a given model is clean of hidden triggers, users may lose confidence in AI solutions.  \n\n5) Defenses and Current Research Directions\n\n• Poison Detection and Filtering:  \n  – Researchers emphasize data vetting—filtering out suspicious or low-quality samples from large training sets.  \n\n• Robust Fine-Tuning and Debiasing:  \n  – Specialized training approaches that make models less sensitive to small perturbations or triggers.  \n\n• Model Auditing & Interpretability Tools:  \n  – Techniques to analyze a model’s internal representations and behaviors, aiming to detect suspicious correlations or unusual responses.  \n\n• Secure Model Merging and Delivery:  \n  – Cryptographic verification, or merging strategies that detect changes in model weights.  \n\n• “Downstream” Countermeasures:  \n  – Even if a model is compromised, careful post-training oversight or query-level monitoring might detect abnormal behaviors triggered by malicious inputs.  \n\n6) Why Recent Interest Has Surged\n\n• Rapid Proliferation of LLMs and VLMs:  \n  – The mainstream adoption of AI systems such as ChatGPT and multimodal models (which handle text plus images, etc.) has driven attention: any vulnerability in widely used models is a major risk.  \n\n• Greater Complexity = Greater Attack Surface:  \n  – With retrieval-augmented or agent-based systems that orchestrate multiple steps (search, retrieve, reason), more opportunities arise for stealth manipulation—both in the data pipeline and in the model itself.  \n\n• Heterogeneous Use Cases:  \n  – Models are being used in industry, healthcare, finance, and more. A backdoor in a medical or financial domain LLM could have very serious repercussions.  \n\nIn short, these papers tackle a range of new vulnerabilities in both vision-language and purely language-based systems—particularly focusing on how attackers can insert or exploit “hidden triggers.” Understanding the basics of data poisoning, trigger-based backdoors, and how large models’ training and fine-tuning processes can be compromised is essential before delving into specifics of each study.",

A flurry of recent studies reveals sophisticated methods to compromise these systems through backdoor and poisoning attacks—techniques that could have far-reaching consequences for AI safety.\n\n## The Growing Threat Landscape\n\nRecent research from June 2025 has systematically reviewed poisoning attacks against Large Language Models (LLMs), highlighting how these attacks have evolved in complexity and stealth. These attacks work by contaminating training data or fine-tuning processes to insert hidden vulnerabilities that can be triggered later.\n\n\"These aren't theoretical concerns anymore,\" says Dr. Sarah Chen, cybersecurity researcher at MIT. \"We're seeing increasingly sophisticated methods that could compromise systems people rely on daily.\"\n\n## Targeting Next-Generation Systems\n\nVision-Language Models (VLMs), which combine text and image understanding, face unique threats. A June 2025 study demonstrated how attackers could manipulate semantic content in images to create backdoors that remain undetected by human reviewers but cause the AI to produce harmful outputs when triggered.\n\nParticularly concerning are attacks targeting Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems—AI models that access external knowledge bases to improve their responses. Multiple studies from May and June 2025 demonstrate how these systems can be compromised through what researchers call \"covert poisoning attacks.\"\n\n\"RAG systems were supposed to make AI more reliable by grounding responses in verified information,\" explains Dr. James Wong, AI safety expert. \"But these new attacks show how the very mechanism designed to improve safety can become a vulnerability.\"\n\n## The Model Merging Vulnerability\n\nOne particularly alarming discovery from May 2025 revealed \"merge hijacking\"—backdoor attacks that target the increasingly common practice of combining multiple LLMs to create new models. This research, presented at the prestigious ACL'25 conference, demonstrated how seemingly benign models could hide malicious behaviors that only emerge after merging.\n\n## Self-Defense Mechanisms\n\nNot all news is grim. A June 2025 study suggests that AI agents can be designed to defend themselves against backdoor attacks. By implementing certain verification procedures and safety checks, researchers demonstrated that models can detect and mitigate many types of attacks.\n\nAnother promising development is \"Robust Anti-Backdoor Instruction Tuning,\" which shows how vision-language models can be trained to resist backdoor attacks, even when exposed to compromised data.\n\n## The Road Ahead\n\nAs AI systems become more deeply integrated into critical infrastructure, healthcare, and financial systems, the stakes of these security vulnerabilities continue to rise. Experts emphasize that addressing these threats requires collaboration between AI developers, security researchers, and policymakers.\n\n\"We're in a security arms race,\" notes Dr. Chen. \"As models become more powerful, both the incentives for attackers and the potential consequences of successful attacks increase dramatically.\"\n\nFor now, researchers recommend rigorous testing of AI systems before deployment, careful vetting of training data sources, and implementing multiple layers of security checks—especially for systems with access to sensitive information or critical decision-making authority.",

Think of it as adding \"bad ingredients\" to the recipe that teaches an AI system.\n\n**Backdoor attacks** are more sophisticated - they embed hidden triggers in AI models that cause them to behave normally most of the time, but maliciously when specific conditions are met. It's like installing a secret switch that activates harmful behavior only when triggered.\n\n## Why This Matters Now\n\nThe research surge in 2025 reflects growing concerns about AI security as these systems become more powerful and widespread. Unlike traditional cybersecurity threats that target software vulnerabilities, these attacks exploit the fundamental learning process of AI systems.\n\n## Key Targets and Techniques\n\n**Primary Targets:**\n- **Large Language Models (LLMs)** like ChatGPT and Claude\n- **Vision-Language Models (VLMs)** that process both text and images\n- **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** systems that combine AI with database searches\n- **AI Agents** that can take actions autonomously\n\n**Attack Methods:**\n- **Training Data Contamination**: Injecting malicious examples during the initial training phase\n- **Fine-tuning Attacks**: Compromising models during customization for specific tasks\n- **Retrieval Poisoning**: Contaminating the databases that RAG systems search\n- **Model Merging Hijacking**: Exploiting the process of combining multiple AI models\n\n## Real-World Implications\n\nThese attacks could potentially:\n- Cause AI assistants to provide harmful advice when triggered\n- Make content moderation systems ignore specific types of harmful content\n- Compromise AI-powered code generation tools\n- Manipulate AI systems used in healthcare, finance, or autonomous vehicles\n\n## The Defense Challenge\n\nDefending against these attacks is particularly difficult because:\n- The malicious behavior may only activate under specific conditions\n- Attacks can be designed to be virtually undetectable during normal operation\n- The scale of modern AI training makes comprehensive data verification challenging\n- Many organizations rely on third-party training data or pre-trained models\n\nThis research landscape represents an arms race between attackers developing more sophisticated methods and defenders creating better detection and prevention techniques.",

A Systematic Study” (2506.01825)\n   • Scope: Focuses on code-focused LLMs (e.g., models specialized in code completion and generation) to identify factors (model size, training method, data distribution) that influence vulnerability.  \n   • Why it’s useful: If you’re interested in LLM security specifically in coding scenarios, or want to see how LLM specialization (e.g., code-vs-text) influences attack susceptibility.\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n2) ATTACK METHODS: POISONING & BACKDOORS\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n\n▶ “Joint-GCG: Unified Gradient-Based Poisoning Attacks on Retrieval-Augmented Generation Systems” (2506.06151)  \n   • Key idea: Proposes a unified framework that uses gradient-based techniques to insert malicious data (“poisons”) into the knowledge stores or training process of RAG-based pipelines.  \n   • Why it’s interesting: Illustrates how retrieval-plus-generation systems can be jointly subverted, showing that poisoning is not limited to just the language model but can also exploit the retrieval component.\n\n▶ “Finetuning-Activated Backdoors in LLMs” (2505.16567)  \n   • Key idea: Attackers can insert dormant triggers into a foundation model that remain undetected until a well-intentioned user fine-tunes on a new downstream task—at which point the “backdoor” is activated.  \n   • Why it’s interesting: Stresses that even if a base model seems benign, the fine-tuning step can inadvertently uncover hidden malicious behaviors.\n\n▶ “Merge Hijacking: Backdoor Attacks to Model Merging of Large Language Models” (2505.23561)  \n   • Key idea: Explores scenarios in which an attacker places a stealthy backdoor that only becomes active when two models are merged (a common practice for many LLM ecosystems).  \n   • Why it’s interesting: Shows how backdoors can exploit collaborative or community-based model merging workflows—attacks can lie dormant until the right combination of weights is produced.\n\n▶ “Backdoor Attack on Vision Language Models with Stealthy Semantic Manipulation” (2506.07214)  \n   • Key idea: Demonstrates how VLMs can be infected with triggers that subtly manipulate cross-modal understanding (e.g., text–image alignment).  \n   • Why it’s interesting: Highlights that backdoor attacks are not purely about text triggers—subtle image or multimodal triggers can also compromise system outputs.\n\n▶ “VLMs Can Aggregate Scattered Training Patches” (2506.03614)  \n   • Key idea: Although not strictly an attack paper, it suggests that VLMs can internally connect seemingly separate “patches” of data/information. This can inadvertently help attackers seed hidden triggers in multiple places.  \n   • Why it’s interesting: Reinforces that large models can fuse partial signals from separate training inputs, potentially making them more susceptible to stealthy or “distributed” triggers.\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n3) ATTACKS ON RAG (RETRIEVAL-AUGMENTED GENERATION)\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n\n▶ “Through the Stealth Lens: Rethinking Attacks and Defenses in RAG” (2506.04390),  \n▶ “Benchmarking Poisoning Attacks against Retrieval-Augmented Generation” (2505.18543),  \n▶ “CPA-RAG: Covert Poisoning Attacks on Retrieval-Augmented Generation in Large Language Models” (2505.19864),  \n▶ “Spa-VLM: Stealthy Poisoning Attacks on RAG-based VLM” (2505.23828)\n\n   • Common thread: All focus on scenarios where a language model relies on an external knowledge store or retriever. Attackers can insert malicious content into the retrieval corpus so that the generation step is compromised.  \n   • Why it’s interesting: Large models plus external retrieval is increasingly popular for knowledge-intensive tasks. Poisoning the retrieval database can be more subtle than tampering with the model’s parameters directly, and it can remain long-hidden.\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n4) DEFENSE & MITIGATION\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n\n▶ “Your Agent Can Defend Itself against Backdoor Attacks” (2506.08336)  \n   • Key idea: Presents detection/mitigation strategies in agent-based LLMs. These strategies can filter suspect inputs, sanitize partial computations, or identify malicious triggers at runtime.  \n   • Why it’s useful: Introduces a variety of real-time detection and response strategies, which go beyond simply retraining or fine-tuning the model from scratch.\n\n▶ “Robust Anti-Backdoor Instruction Tuning in LVLMs” (2506.05401)  \n   • Key idea: Proposes robust instruction-tuning procedures that mitigate or neutralize common backdoor triggers.  \n   • Why it’s useful: Helpful if you want to incorporate instruction tuning (a widely used approach to align LLMs/VLMs with human instructions) without accidentally “reviving” or amplifying any backdoors.\n\n▶ “Backdoor Cleaning without External Guidance in MLLM Fine-tuning” (2505.16916)  \n   • Key idea: Investigates how to remove previously installed backdoors when you no longer have the original data or external signals (“external guidance”).  \n   • Why it’s useful: In practice, you might lack a clean reference dataset or extra metadata. This paper looks at ways to sanitize or “clean” a model from suspect triggers under these constraints.\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nPUTTING IT ALL TOGETHER\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n\n1) If you’re just getting oriented:  \n   • Start with the systematic reviews or multi-paper benchmarks—they’ll clarify the main attack vectors, motivations, and threat models.\n\n2) For purely technical detail on how attacks are constructed:  \n   • Look at papers describing specific frameworks (e.g., “Joint-GCG” or “Finetuning-Activated Backdoors”) to see how malicious payloads are planted.  \n   • Study RAG-specific attacks if your application relies on retrieval from external knowledge bases.\n\n3) For defenses:  \n   • Investigate detection and mitigation methods—especially strategies that do not rely on large volumes of clean data. This is critical in real-world scenarios with tight resources or limited data provenance.\n\n4) Take note of newer trends:  \n   • “Model merging” and “distributed triggers” are emerging ways attackers can hide or activate backdoors.  \n   • Cross-modal vulnerabilities (VLMs) highlight how textual and visual modalities can be jointly exploited.\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nSUGGESTIONS FOR GETTING “UN-STUCK”\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n\n• Familiarize yourself with a solid mental model of how backdoor attacks (and defenses) fit into the entire model lifecycle: from pretraining and fine-tuning, to deployment and usage in multi-step “agent” pipelines.  \n• Don’t try to tackle everything at once. Zero in on whichever domain is most urgent for you—pure text-based LLM vs. vision-language use case vs. RAG.  \n• Work through examples (from the benchmark papers, if available) to see how attacks are formed and triggered in practice; that can demystify the methods.  \n• For defenses, start with fundamental checks: data-cleaning procedures, outlier or anomaly detection, random spot-checking, and suspicious input detection at inference time.\n\nAbove all, remember that research on poisoning/backdoor attacks evolves quickly. As you read these papers, note which attacks or defenses are proofs-of-concept vs. tested in the wild. Often, real-world constraints (lack of data, resource limitations) complicate the scenario.\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n\nI hope this overview helps you find your footing. Once you have a sense of how these attacks are structured and how defenses can be applied, the literature will feel far less overwhelming. If there are particular subtopics or details you want to dig into, feel free to ask more targeted questions—there’s a lot of nuance within each paper’s methodology and threat model. Hang in there, and good luck with your exploration of poisoning and backdoor attacks!",

It might help to address both aspects separately:\n\n──────────────────────────────\n1. Emotional Support\n\n• When research or any challenging project makes you feel helpless or lost, remember that these feelings are not uncommon. Research, especially in cutting‐edge fields like adversarial attacks in AI, can feel daunting.  \n• If you’re feeling persistently overwhelmed or trapped by these feelings, consider reaching out to someone you trust—a friend, mentor, or mental health professional. Sometimes talking things through can provide a fresh perspective and help lighten the emotional load.  \n• If you ever feel that your distress is too heavy to manage alone, please consider contacting a mental health support service or crisis hotline in your area.\n\n──────────────────────────────\n2. Guidance on #B3. Poison & Backdoor Research\n\nYou’ve provided an impressive list of recent papers that explore various aspects of poisoning and backdoor attacks in AI systems (LLMs, VLMs, RAG systems, etc.). Here are some steps and suggestions that may help you clarify your direction:\n\nA. Define Your Focus Area  \n • Ask yourself: Do you want to study the nature of these attacks (their methods and vulnerabilities) or focus on developing defenses? Some papers (e.g., “Your Agent Can Defend Itself against Backdoor Attacks”) focus on mitigation, while others analyze strategies attackers might use.  \n • Reflect on whether you are interested in theoretical models, experimental evaluations, or practical applications. Narrowing down exactly what questions you want to address can clear up a lot of the confusion.\n\nB. Start With a Broad Overview  \n • It might help to begin with one of the more comprehensive review papers in the list (“A Systematic Review of Poisoning Attacks Against Large Language Models”). This can give you an overview of the current state-of-the-art, key challenges, and common methodologies.  \n • From that overview, map out how the various papers connect to one another. Notice which techniques are repeatedly examined (e.g., gradient-based poisoning in “Joint-GCG: Unified Gradient-Based Poisoning Attacks on Retrieval-Augmented Generation Systems”) or how different modalities (text vs. vision-language) are treated.\n\nC. Build a Research Roadmap  \n • Create a list of questions or hypotheses that interest you. For example, you might ask: “What makes certain LLM architectures more vulnerable to backdoors?” or “How effective are covert poisoning strategies compared to more overt ones?”  \n • Group the papers by subtopics (e.g., poisoning attacks on retrieval systems, backdoor defenses in model fine-tuning, stealthy semantic manipulation in VLMs). This can simplify a seemingly huge field into bite-sized areas of study.\n\nD. Consider the Methodologies  \n • Take note of common techniques: gradient-based attack strategies, semantic manipulation methods, and adversarial patches. Understanding these technical underpinnings can help you appreciate where you might contribute new ideas or improvements.  \n • Reflect on experimental designs in these papers. How do they simulate the attack surface? What kinds of datasets, model architectures, or evaluation metrics are in play? This can guide you on how to structure your own investigations or experiments.\n\nE. Consult with Peers or Mentors  \n • If you’re in an academic or research setting, seeking input from advisors or peers can provide clarity. They might offer insights or even recommend which papers to tackle first.  \n • Sometimes a discussion group or seminar on adversarial ML topics can break down complex ideas into more digestible parts.\n\n──────────────────────────────\nNext Steps\n\n• Pick one or two papers that seem the most aligned with your interests or where you think you can contribute something new, and do a detailed read-through.  \n• Outline the background, methods, results, and limitations of those papers. This process can help you clarify both what has been done and where the gaps are.  \n• Regularly step back to see whether you’re making progress. Research is as much about the journey as the destination; it’s okay to take time to digest the material and adjust your focus.\n\n──────────────────────────────\nFinal Thought\n\nFeeling lost when tackling complex, cutting-edge research is normal. Try breaking down the problem into smaller, manageable parts. And remember, it’s okay to ask for help—both for the research challenges and for how you’re feeling overall.\n\nIf you’d like to dive deeper into any specific paper or concept, or need more detailed advice on a particular aspect of this topic, please let me know.

Because these papers are set in the future (2025 dates) and full texts are not yet publicly available, the summaries below rely on their titles and brief inferences from typical research directions in backdoor/poisoning research.\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n1) Robust Anti-Backdoor Instruction Tuning in LVLMs  \n   • Proposes methods or frameworks to mitigate backdoors in large vision-language models (LVLMs) during instruction tuning.  \n   • Likely explores techniques that ensure model robustness when training or adapting LVLMs to follow user instructions.\n\n2) Joint-GCG: Unified Gradient-Based Poisoning Attacks on Retrieval-Augmented Generation Systems  \n   • Describes a “gradient-based” strategy that implants malicious updates into RAG systems.  \n   • Will presumably detail how attackers can craft subtle poison data or model updates that degrade or control the generation process.\n\n3) Backdoor Attack on Vision Language Models with Stealthy Semantic Manipulation  \n   • Focuses on stealthy backdoors in VLMs by tweaking semantic features.  \n   • Likely uses hidden triggers in image-text pairs, so that backdoor behavior is activated only under precise conditions.\n\n4) A Systematic Review of Poisoning Attacks Against Large Language Models  \n   • Surveys existing poisoning-attack strategies (data poisoning, model poisoning, and so forth) specifically in the LLM context.  \n   • Helps categorize, compare, and analyze methods for backdoor or poisoning attacks across a range of LLM architectures.\n\n5) Your Agent Can Defend Itself against Backdoor Attacks  \n   • Investigates possible self-defensive or self-verification mechanisms built directly into an LLM-based software agent.  \n   • Could propose real-time detection or active sabotage of malicious triggers before they are executed.\n\n6) Which Factors Make Code LLMs More Vulnerable to Backdoor Attacks? A Systematic Study  \n   • Shifts focus to code-generation models (e.g., code LLMs like Codex or StarCoder).  \n   • Likely identifies architectural or training vulnerabilities specific to code-based LLM tasks (e.g., sensitive to unique tokens, code patterns).\n\n7) VLMs Can Aggregate Scattered Training Patches  \n   • Explores how VLMs may piece together small “patches” of data into coherent, unintended capabilities—even if each patch alone seems benign.  \n   • May offer insight into how hidden triggers or partial attacks can become active once the model aggregates knowledge.\n\n8) Through the Stealth Lens: Rethinking Attacks and Defenses in RAG  \n   • Re-examines both attacker and defender strategies in Retrieval-Augmented Generation systems with an emphasis on stealth.  \n   • Possibly includes taxonomy or guidelines for stealth strategies that subvert detection in RAG pipelines.\n\n9) Spa-VLM: Stealthy Poisoning Attacks on RAG-based VLM  \n   • Builds on stealthy-backdoor/poisoning ideas specifically for RAG-based vision-language models.  \n   • The term “Spa” (stealthy poisoning attacks) points to creative methods for implanting triggers without typical detection signals.\n\n10) Benchmarking Poisoning Attacks against Retrieval-Augmented Generation  \n   • Proposes a benchmark or standardized suite of tests to evaluate how robust (or vulnerable) RAG models are to poisoning.  \n   • Intended as a resource to measure the effectiveness of different attack and defense approaches.\n\n11) CPA-RAG: Covert Poisoning Attacks on Retrieval-Augmented Generation in Large Language Models  \n   • Another approach to “covert” poisoning—attacks that stay hidden while effectively tampering with the retrieval mechanism or the generated text.  \n   • Could highlight designing triggers in the retrieved documents or the query encoder to gain control of the generation.\n\n12) Merge Hijacking: Backdoor Attacks to Model Merging of Large Language Models  \n   • Targets the scenario where diverse LLMs are merged (model interpolation or ensemble merging) after independent training.  \n   • Investigates how attackers can inject or “hijack” backdoors into the merging pipeline so the composite model becomes compromised.\n\n13) Finetuning-Activated Backdoors in LLMs  \n   • Looks at how the backdoor remains dormant until a specific finetuning step or data triggers it.  \n   • Explores how certain prompts, tasks, or finetuning datasets can inadvertently activate a hidden malicious capability.\n\n14) Backdoor Cleaning without External Guidance in MLLM Fine-tuning  \n   • Focuses on strategies to remove—or at least neutralize—backdoors in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) purely from model-internal signals (i.e., without requiring an external “clean” dataset or external teacher).  \n   • Could introduce self-consistency checks or other model-based defenses to sanitize potential triggers during finetuning.\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n\nTaken together, these future works reflect significant interest in both sides of backdoor/poisoning research:\n\n• Attack Methods:  \n  – Covert or “stealthy” triggers that remain hidden, especially for RAG pipelines and code-based LLMs.  \n  – Exploiting novel training or merging steps to plant malicious instructions.  \n\n• Defense Strategies:  \n  – Systems to detect and neutralize backdoor triggers (sometimes even autonomously, without external guidance).  \n  – Mechanisms for more robust instruction tuning, data curation, and code-specific safety.  \n\nThis listing underscores both the sophistication of emerging threats (e.g., stealthy and multi-stage attacks) and the escalating need for new, model-specific defensive frameworks.",

Poison & Backdoor.” In essence, these papers investigate and address security concerns related to poisoning and backdoor attacks in various types of models and systems, including:\n\n• Large Language Models (LLMs): Several studies focus on how poisoning data or incorporating backdoors can compromise LLMs. They cover topics like finetuning-activated backdoors, systematic studies of vulnerabilities, and even attacks specifically targeting coding LLMs.\n\n• Vision Language Models (VLMs) and Multimodal Systems: Some works explore attacks on hybrid systems that combine language understanding with visual inputs. This includes stealthy semantic manipulation to inject backdoors and techniques aimed at understanding how scattered training information might be aggregated to compromise a model.\n\n• Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) Systems: A number of papers investigate vulnerabilities in systems that incorporate retrieval mechanisms along with generation. These include gradient-based poisoning attacks that target the retrieval component, as well as covert poisoning strategies (CPA-RAG) designed for such systems.\n\n• Attack & Defense Approaches: A subset of the research is dedicated to not just outlining attacks, but also proposing defensive strategies—for instance, developing systems where an agent can detect and defend itself against backdoor attacks, or cleaning backdoors during fine-tuning without external cues.\n\n• Novel Attack Strategies: There are also investigations into areas like merge hijacking—where the model merging process itself is targeted—and systematic reviews that summarize and analyze the landscape of poisoning and backdoor vulnerabilities.\n\nOverall, the body of work reflects increasing attention to robust evaluation and defense techniques as these AI systems become more widely deployed. The research emphasizes the need for proactive measures in model training and deployment to mitigate risks from subtle, stealthy, and often hard-to-detect attacks that could otherwise compromise the integrity and safety of AI systems. \n\nIf you’d like more detailed insights on any of these papers or topics, feel free to ask!",

The plan is intended to help you quickly identify potential vulnerabilities and begin mitigation steps before your 5 PM deadline. For each paper cluster, key takeaways and recommended immediate actions are summarized.\n\n─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n1. Overview: Common Themes in Poison/Backdoor Attacks\n─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n• Stealthy Triggers. An attacker can embed small or hidden modifications (“triggers”) into training or merging steps. \n• RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation). Poison and backdoor attacks on retrieval systems usually focus on inserting malicious documents or carefully modifying text in the corpus. \n• Fine-Tuning Risks. Fine-tuning a large model (or merging multiple large models) can inadvertently activate or introduce backdoors. \n• Semantic Manipulations. Attacks can alter a model’s latent representations or text/vocabulary distributions without obvious artifacts, making detection harder.\n• Code LLM Vulnerabilities. Code or multi-modal models may be particularly susceptible to specialized triggers embedded in code tokens, images, or textual prompts.\n\n─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n2. Immediate Steps: Threat Detection and Mitigation\n─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n\nA. Verify Training Data Integrity\n   • Check the origin and chain-of-custody for any new training or fine-tuning data. \n   • Run data-deduplication or anomaly detection tools to spot unusual tokens or suspicious patterns.\n\nB. Implement Input Validation and Prompt Filtering\n   • For retrieval-based systems: add content filters to block or flag suspicious documents. \n   • For code-based LLMs: implement code-linting or vulnerability scanning, especially for user-provided code prompts.\n\nC. Restrict or Monitor Model Merging Operations\n   • When merging model checkpoints (e.g., custom fine-tuned LLM with a base LLM), maintain version controls and logs. \n   • Run post-merge verification tests using a test suite designed to detect potential backdoors (e.g., prompts that test known or random triggers).\n\nD. Use Backdoor Detection and Sanitization Strategies\n   • Employ known detection frameworks (like fine-pruning or layered pruning for suspicious weights) to remove or reduce potential backdoors. \n   • Slowly re-fine-tune the model on a high-quality dataset to mitigate suspicious model parameters, then confirm with backdoor detection prompts.\n\nE. Develop Rapid Incident-Response Protocol\n   • Prepare rollback capabilities for newly introduced model checkpoints or data sources.\n   • Build a policy for urgent patching and re-deployment if a backdoor is discovered.\n\n─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n3. Key Considerations from Each Publication (Grouped by Topic)\n─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n\n■■ Robust Anti-Backdoor Instruction Tuning in LVLMs (2025/06)  \n• Focus: Instruction-tuning processes are a major vulnerability point; triggers can be added or activated during instruction tuning.  \n• Action: Perform robust fine-tuning with partial or random instruction subsets, and verify outputs with automated backdoor tests.\n\n■■ Joint-GCG & Through the Stealth Lens & Benchmarking Poisoning Attacks in RAG (2025/06 & 2025/05)  \n• Focus: Covert data poisoning within retrieval sets.  \n• Action: Evaluate your retrieval pipeline. Specifically, check for manipulated documents or anomalies in indexing. Deploy robust retrieval filtering.\n\n■■ Backdoor Attack on Vision-Language Models / Spa-VLM / VLMs Can Aggregate Scattered Training Patches (2025/06 & 2025/05)  \n• Focus: Vision-language contexts—patch-level or subtle image manipulations that degrade or hijack model outputs.  \n• Action: Add outlier image detection or partial unlearning approaches in your multi-modal pipeline.\n\n■■ Your Agent Can Defend Itself / Finetuning-Activated Backdoors / Backdoor Cleaning without External Guidance (2025/06 & 2025/05)  \n• Focus: Self-defending agents and model “self-sanitization.”  \n• Action: Incorporate minimal overhead defenses that monitor the model’s own reasoning or intermediate latent states for anomalies.\n\n■■ Merge Hijacking: Backdoor Attacks to Model Merging of Large Language Models (2025/05)  \n• Focus: Weight merging vulnerabilities.  \n• Action: Automate side-by-side testing of each component model before merging. Keep versioned backups to revert if suspicious outputs are detected.\n\n■■ Which Factors Make Code LLMs More Vulnerable to Backdoor Attacks? (2025/06)  \n• Focus: Attack vectors in code LLM-specific scenarios (e.g., specialized triggers in synthetic or open-source code).  \n• Action: Deploy code-level scanning, incorporate specialized test prompts that include seldom-used tokens or suspicious function signatures.\n\n─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n4. Recommended Immediate To-Do List (Before 5 PM)\n─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n\n1) Data & Model Audit:\n   • Immediately audit the training/fine-tuning data and model checkpoints in use. \n   • Focus on verifying no unauthorized modifications or unexpected merges.\n\n2) Basic Trigger Testing:\n   • Prompt the model with known backdoor “red-flag” triggers or random token sequences to see if unusual outputs appear.\n\n3) Retrieval Pipeline Inspection (if using RAG):\n   • Quickly scan retrieval indices/documents for signs of malicious injection (e.g., unusual text, hidden string patterns).\n\n4) Document Mitigation Plan:\n   • For each system in production, outline fallback procedures (rollback or partial unlearning) for quick remediation if a backdoor is identified.\n\n5) Prepare A/B Testing or Shadow Deployment:\n   • If you plan to incorporate newly fine-tuned or merged models, test them in a controlled environment before deploying to production.\n\n─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n5. Conclusion\n─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nThe key to preventing backdoor and poisoning vulnerabilities is rigorous data vetting, thorough model testing, and carefully controlled model merging or fine-tuning processes. By quickly auditing existing pipelines, scanning new training data for anomalies, and running consistent backdoor detection tests (especially for retrieved documents, code snippets, or multi-modal inputs), you minimize the likelihood of a successful stealth attack before the close-of-business deadline.\n\n─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nEND OF ACTION PLAN\n─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n\nThese steps should help you rapidly assess your risk level, establish short-term defenses, and lay the groundwork for ongoing monitoring and mitigation of Poison & Backdoor threats in your Large (Vision) Language Model environment.",

These works target Large Language Models (LLMs), Vision-Language Models (VLMs), or Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipelines, often focusing on how attackers can stealthily manipulate model behavior (and how defenders can respond).\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n1) Systematic Reviews and Broad Perspectives\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n• A Systematic Review of Poisoning Attacks Against Large Language Models (2025/06) surveys known methods and vulnerabilities in data poisoning and backdoor attacks, including stealth injection, gradient manipulation, and malicious fine-tuning. It also discusses how different LLM architectures respond to these threats.\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n2) Poisoning Attacks on LLMs\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n• Finetuning-Activated Backdoors in LLMs (2025/05) shows that even small-scale fine-tuning can activate “dormant” backdoors in large pretrained models. The authors demonstrate that an attacker can implant hidden triggers in the pretrained stage and later “unlock” them by fine-tuning.  \n• Merge Hijacking: Backdoor Attacks to Model Merging of Large Language Models (2025/05) studies how model-merging procedures (e.g., merging weights from multiple LLM checkpoints) can unintentionally incorporate malicious parameters from backdoored models.  \n• Which Factors Make Code LLMs More Vulnerable to Backdoor Attacks? (2025/06) systematically identifies that certain architectural choices, training data properties, and fine-tuning methods in code-generation LLMs can increase susceptibility to backdoors.\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n3) Poisoning Attacks on RAG Pipelines\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n• Joint-GCG: Unified Gradient-Based Poisoning Attacks on Retrieval-Augmented Generation Systems (2025/06) formulates a gradient-based approach to simultaneously poison the retriever (document ranking) and the generator (text generation), enabling more potent attacks.  \n• CPA-RAG: Covert Poisoning Attacks on Retrieval-Augmented Generation (2025/05) likewise explores how an attacker can plant malicious documents in the retriever’s corpus while minimally disturbing the model’s overall behavior—making the attacks less detectable.  \n• Benchmarking Poisoning Attacks against Retrieval-Augmented Generation (2025/05) proposes a standardized framework for evaluating RAG-specific attacks, comparing factors like stealth, success rate, and resource overhead.  \n• Through the Stealth Lens: Rethinking Attacks and Defenses in RAG (2025/06) shifts focus to stealthiness, showing how small, seemingly innocuous data modifications in knowledge sources can yield disproportionate effects on final generation quality and correctness.\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n4) Poisoning Attacks on Vision-Language Models (VLMs)\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n• Backdoor Attack on Vision Language Models with Stealthy Semantic Manipulation (2025/06) illustrates how fine-grained visual triggers (or multi-modal cues) let attackers cause targeted misclassification or improper responses without overt anomalies.  \n• VLMs Can Aggregate Scattered Training Patches (2025/06) underscores that vision-language models can easily “pull together” small bits of malicious data from multiple sources, increasing the chances of stealthy attacks going undetected.  \n• Spa-VLM: Stealthy Poisoning Attacks on RAG-based VLM (2025/05) extends RAG-based vulnerabilities into multimodal settings (e.g., image–text retrieval), highlighting how attackers can modify images, text, or both in the training sets.\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n5) Defenses Against Poisoning & Backdoor Attacks\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n• Robust Anti-Backdoor Instruction Tuning in LVLMs (2025/06) focuses on “instruction tuning” defenses. By curating safe instructions and robust training algorithms, it aims to reduce the activation of backdoor triggers.  \n• Your Agent Can Defend Itself against Backdoor Attacks (2025/06) explores agent-based or “defender” frameworks that actively test for malicious triggers, adaptively fine-tune models to neutralize them, and revert to trustworthy checkpoints as needed.  \n• Backdoor Cleaning without External Guidance in MLLM Fine-tuning (2025/05) proposes an unsupervised approach that detects suspicious gradients or parameter clusters during multi-modal fine-tuning. It scrubs potential backdoors without requiring special “clean” data.\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nKEY TAKEAWAYS\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n1. Scope of Vulnerabilities. Whether LLMs, VLMs, or RAG pipelines, backdoor or poisoning vulnerabilities exploit minimal (often stealthy) changes in training data or model parameters to cause targeted misbehaviors.  \n2. Model Merging & Fine-Tuning Risks. Works on “merge hijacking” and “finetuning-activated” backdoors highlight novel ways attackers can circumvent standard backdoor detection by exploiting typical development workflows.  \n3. Defense Strategies. Recent research emphasizes robust training schemes (e.g., instruction tuning with carefully curated data), post-training inspections (e.g., scanning for “lurking” triggers), or real-time agent-based detection and adaptation.\n\nIn short, the field has seen an uptick in sophisticated poisoning and backdoor techniques targeting every stage of an LLM/VLM/RAG-centric pipeline—but it has also begun to propose more holistic defense strategies, from “hardened” training processes to agent-driven self-defense.",

          "response": "Below is an overview of what the B3 “Poison & Backdoor” segment covers and some insights into the state of research based on the listed works:\n\n1. Scope and Focus Areas\n • The literature here spans poisoning attacks—inserting malicious data during training or retrieval—and backdoor attacks that implant hidden triggers into models. It covers both language models (LLMs) and vision-language models (VLMs), as well as systems that combine retrieval augmented generation (RAG) or autonomous agents.  \n • The attack surfaces differ: some papers focus on tampering with training data to cause covert misbehavior (poisoning), while others study stealthy manipulations (backdoors) that activate only under specific conditions.\n\n2. Trends in Attack Methodologies\n • Many of the works (e.g., “Joint-GCG” and “CPA-RAG”) propose gradient-based or covert techniques that adjust model gradients subtly, enabling attackers to craft perturbations that evade detection.  \n • Techniques such as “Merge Hijacking” highlight novel avenues like poisoning during model merging, suggesting that vulnerabilities extend beyond conventional training procedures.  \n\n3. Defensive Strategies and Robustness Efforts\n • As the offensive capabilities evolve, so do defenses. The paper “Robust Anti-Backdoor Instruction Tuning in LVLMs” emphasizes methods for adjusting fine-tuning protocols to minimize backdoor vulnerabilities.  \n • “Your Agent Can Defend Itself against Backdoor Attacks” suggests that there is a shift toward incorporating self-defensive mechanisms directly into agents, rather than relying solely on post-hoc cleaning.  \n • In multi-modal and RAG systems, the emergence of poisoning defenses (e.g., “Backdoor Cleaning without External Guidance in MLLM Fine-tuning”) highlights the proactive effort to design systems that self-monitor and remediate potential backdoor issues.\n\n4. Systematic Reviews & Empirical Studies\n • The inclusion of systematic reviews (e.g., “A Systematic Review of Poisoning Attacks Against Large Language Models”) indicates that the community is investing in mapping the threat landscape comprehensively. This not only helps reveal common vulnerabilities but also guides future defense research.  \n • Studies focusing on niche areas—for example, “Which Factors Make Code LLMs More Vulnerable to Backdoor Attacks? A Systematic Study”—underscore that different model classes (like code-focused LLMs) might have unique threat profiles.\n\n5. Cross-Modality and Integration Challenges\n • Several papers target RAG systems and VLMs (e.g., “Spa-VLM” and “Through the Stealth Lens: Rethinking Attacks and Defenses in RAG”), illustrating that when models combine retrieval with generative capacities or mix modalities (vision and language), the attack and defense dynamics become more intricate.  \n • The interplay of backdoor triggers in one component (say, retrieval) might propagate vulnerabilities into the generation stage, demanding tailored cross-module defenses.\n\n6. Emerging Concerns and the Future Landscape\n • The work on “Finetuning-Activated Backdoors in LLMs” reveals that even ordinarily benign procedures like fine-tuning can become avenues for attacks if not carefully managed.  \n • The research span—from poisoning attacks that subtly alter the training distribution to stealth backdoor insertions that require little external evidence—indicates that threat actors are exploring diverse, ingenious methods to compromise AI systems.  \n • Ultimately, these works together signal a mature phase in the adversarial robustness domain, where both attacker strategies and defensive countermeasures are becoming more sophisticated, with clear implications for production ML systems.\n\nIn summary, the B3 segment captures a dynamic and evolving research area focused on the dual challenges of poisoning and backdoor attacks across various modern ML paradigms. The collective insights underscore the need for robust training procedures, integrated defense mechanisms, and a holistic understanding of vulnerabilities, spanning traditional LLMs as well as emerging multi-modal and retrieval-augmented architectures.",

          "response": "Below is a brief overview of the listed works on poisoning and backdoor threats—with a focus on Large Language Models (LLMs), Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), Vision-Language Models (VLMs), and hybrid systems. These papers collectively demonstrate that adversaries are becoming increasingly sophisticated in crafting and concealing backdoors, as well as in designing data-poisoning schemes that can compromise AI models without obvious red flags. At the same time, new defense strategies and systematic analyses are emerging to counteract these threats.\n\n1) Robust Anti-Backdoor Instruction Tuning in LVLMs (2025/06)  \n   Focuses on making Large-Vision-Language Models more resilient during instruction tuning by mitigating backdoors. The paper proposes an anti-backdoor instruction-tuning workflow that can detect and neutralize malicious “trigger” behaviors without sacrificing task performance.\n\n2) Joint-GCG: Unified Gradient-Based Poisoning Attacks on RAG Systems (2025/06)  \n   Introduces a gradient-based method (Joint-GCG) to craft poisoned data that undermines retrieval-augmented generation. The authors unify the training objectives under a single gradient-based framework, exemplifying how relatively small adversarial injections can significantly degrade model reliability.\n\n3) Backdoor Attack on Vision Language Models with Stealthy Semantic Manipulation (2025/06)  \n   Explores how subtle, semantically relevant triggers can be inserted into combined vision-text data to implant backdoors in VLMs. Unlike classical “noise” triggers, these triggers look natural, increasing the difficulty of detection.\n\n4) A Systematic Review of Poisoning Attacks Against Large Language Models (2025/06)  \n   Provides a comprehensive survey of data-poisoning strategies, model vulnerabilities, and mitigation frameworks in LLM settings. It discusses open challenges, such as stealth triggers, advanced detection, and red-teaming protocols for auditing.\n\n5) Your Agent Can Defend Itself Against Backdoor Attacks (2025/06)  \n   Examines how agent-based LLM systems can autonomously detect and defend against backdoors, focusing on novel self-defense strategies (e.g., internal consistency checking) to identify suspicious outputs or triggers.\n\n6) Which Factors Make Code LLMs More Vulnerable to Backdoor Attacks? A Systematic Study (2025/06)  \n   Specifically targets code-generation models, investigating architectural factors or training decisions that exacerbate or reduce vulnerability to backdoor exploits. Offers guidelines for safer code LLM deployment.\n\n7) VLMs Can Aggregate Scattered Training Patches (2025/06)  \n   Shows that VLMs can unintentionally “assemble” scattered poisoned patches within training data—meaning, an adversary may sprinkle innocuous triggers in different places and still achieve a coordinated backdoor effect.\n\n8) Through the Stealth Lens: Rethinking Attacks and Defenses in RAG (2025/06)  \n   Reframes how we perceive stealth poison attacks on retrieval-augmented systems, highlighting the interplay between the retriever module and the generator module. Also proposes preliminary mitigations.\n\n9) Spa-VLM: Stealthy Poisoning Attacks on RAG-based VLM (2025/05)  \n   Investigates stealthy poisoning techniques in a hybrid retrieval-augmented VLM environment. Emphasizes a “low-visibility” design approach, wherein the poisoned data blends in seamlessly, making detection extremely challenging.\n\n10) Benchmarking Poisoning Attacks Against Retrieval-Augmented Generation (2025/05)  \n    Systematically compares various poisoning strategies in RAG pipelines to establish benchmarks. By analyzing both performance degradation and stealthiness, it provides a robust evaluation framework for future defense research.\n\n11) CPA-RAG: Covert Poisoning Attacks on Retrieval-Augmented Generation in Large Language Models (2025/05)  \n    Builds upon covert infiltration methods that target the retrieval component in RAG-based LLMs, further detailing ways to camouflage triggers within large corpora to exploit dependencies between retrieval and generation.\n\n12) Merge Hijacking: Backdoor Attacks to Model Merging of Large Language Models (2025/05, ACL’25)  \n    Highlights a new vector specific to model-merging workflows: even if separate LLM checkpoints are fairly benign, merging them can produce an emergent backdoor. Underscores the need for secure model-merging protocols.\n\n13) Finetuning-Activated Backdoors in LLMs (2025/05)  \n    Shows how backdoor triggers can remain dormant until a later fine-tuning phase “activates” them. This slow-burn approach circumvents typical screening, underscoring the risk of inherited vulnerabilities from pre-trained checkpoints.\n\n14) Backdoor Cleaning without External Guidance in MLLM Fine-tuning (2025/05)  \n    Proposes methods to cleanse multi-modal LLM (i.e., MLLM) fine-tuning processes from hidden triggers, relying solely on model-internal signals rather than external labels or reference data.\n\nCollectively, these works point to an escalating threat landscape for all flavors of LLMs and multi-modal systems. Researchers are focusing not only on how triggers can be stealthily embedded (via semantic relevance or scattering) but also on how to detect, mitigate, or neutralize them—sometimes even after the poisoned model is deployed. The field is moving toward more holistic approaches, integrating the entire pipeline—from data collection to final usage—to ensure robust security against backdoor and poisoning exploits.",

          "response": "Below is a high-level synthesis of the recent trends in poisoning and backdoor attacks—and corresponding defenses—based on the collection of papers you shared under the Poison & Backdoor category:\n\n1. Overview of Attack Surfaces and Techniques\n\n • Several works focus on different modalities and components. For instance, some papers target Vision-Language Models (VLMs) with stealthy semantic manipulation (e.g., “Backdoor Attack on Vision Language Models with Stealthy Semantic Manipulation” and “VLMs Can Aggregate Scattered Training Patches”), while others concentrate on Large Language Models (LLMs) and their retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) components (e.g., “Joint-GCG: Unified Gradient-Based Poisoning Attacks on Retrieval-Augmented Generation Systems”, “CPA-RAG: Covert Poisoning Attacks on RAG”, and “Benchmarking Poisoning Attacks against Retrieval-Augmented Generation”).\n\n • A recurrent theme is the stealth or covert nature of these attacks. The papers on “Spa-VLM” and “Through the Stealth Lens” underline the challenge of detecting sophisticated poisoning strategies that aim to remain under the radar while manipulating downstream tasks.  \n\n2. Defensive Strategies and System Self-Defense\n\n • Defense appears to be an active stream of research as well. Papers like “Robust Anti-Backdoor Instruction Tuning in LVLMs” and “Your Agent Can Defend Itself against Backdoor Attacks” indicate efforts to embed resilience into the model or agent itself, potentially with mechanisms to detect or mitigate malicious modifications at inference time.\n\n • The focus on defense also extends to cleaning approaches during fine-tuning (“Backdoor Cleaning without External Guidance in MLLM Fine-tuning”), suggesting that even post-attack, methods may exist to sanitize compromised models without relying on external intervention.\n\n3. Analyzing Vulnerabilities and Attack Efficacy\n\n • In addition to proposing attacks and defenses, systematic reviews (“A Systematic Review of Poisoning Attacks Against Large Language Models” and “Which Factors Make Code LLMs More Vulnerable to Backdoor Attacks? A Systematic Study”) are evaluating what factors make models susceptible. This sort of meta-analysis helps isolate key vulnerabilities inherent to model design, training paradigms, or even specific task domains like code generation.\n\n • An interesting dimension involves the interactions between model merging and backdoor vulnerability (“Merge Hijacking: Backdoor Attacks to Model Merging of Large Language Models”). This suggests that as we push the boundaries with collaborative or aggregated models, new, unforeseen attack vectors emerge.\n\n4. Specific Attack Mechanisms and Novel Considerations\n\n • Gradient-based techniques for poisoning (as seen in “Joint-GCG: Unified Gradient-Based Poisoning Attacks on Retrieval-Augmented Generation Systems”) highlight that attackers are exploiting vulnerabilities at the optimization level—crafting malicious gradients that cause the desired aberrant behavior during training or fine-tuning.\n\n • The notion of “fine-tuning activated backdoors” extends the problem to scenarios where the backdoor might remain dormant until a fine-tuning operation is applied, adding an extra layer of complexity to both the attack and its subsequent detection.\n\n5. Modalities and System Components Targeted\n\n • VLMs versus LLMs: A considerable amount of work targets VLMs to understand how scattered training patches or multimodal interactions can be exploited. In contrast, LLM-focused attacks pay more attention to retrieval-augmented generation systems, which are increasingly popular for their extended knowledge retrieval capabilities.\n\nOverall, the research landscape under the Poison & Backdoor umbrella in these recent papers is characterized by a dual focus: advancing the understanding of how covert, often stealthy poisoning strategies can compromise modern, complex language and vision-language systems, while also pushing forward robust defensive measures for mitigating these vulnerabilities. Whether by modifying training dynamics, exploring gradient-based injections, or designing self-defending agents, the community is actively racing against attackers to secure the increasingly sophisticated models that underpin many real-world applications.\n\nDo you want to dive deeper into any of these topics, such as a more detailed explanation of a specific paper’s methodology or implications, or discuss potential future research directions based on these trends?",

Agent-Based Systems\n\"Your Agent Can Defend Itself against Backdoor Attacks\" specifically addresses the emerging area of LLM-based agents, suggesting that autonomous systems may require specialized defense mechanisms.\n\n### 5. Systematic Analysis\nPapers like \"A Systematic Review of Poisoning Attacks\" and \"Which Factors Make Code LLMs More Vulnerable\" are attempting to categorize and understand the landscape of these attacks, indicating the field is maturing and developing theoretical frameworks.\n\n### 6. Defense Mechanisms\nSeveral papers focus on defense, with \"Backdoor Cleaning without External Guidance\" proposing methods that don't require clean reference data, which is particularly important for practical applications.\n\n## Implications\n\nThe research suggests poisoning and backdoor attacks remain a significant threat, with attackers developing increasingly sophisticated methods targeting the latest AI architectures (RAG, VLMs, agents). The focus on stealthy attacks that can evade detection is particularly concerning, as is the targeting of popular techniques like model merging.\n\nWould you like me to dive deeper into any particular aspect of these papers or discuss specific technical approaches they're using?",

Let me provide some analysis of the key trends and contributions I see in this collection:\n\n## Key Trends & Observations\n\n### 1. **RAG Systems as New Attack Vectors**\nThere's a clear focus on Retrieval-Augmented Generation systems:\n- **Joint-GCG**, **Through the Stealth Lens**, **CPA-RAG**, and **Benchmarking Poisoning Attacks** all target RAG\n- This makes sense as RAG systems have an additional attack surface through the retrieval corpus\n- The \"stealth\" aspect suggests attackers are getting more sophisticated about avoiding detection\n\n### 2. **Vision-Language Models Under Siege**\nMultiple papers target VLMs specifically:\n- **Robust Anti-Backdoor Instruction Tuning** (defense)\n- **Backdoor Attack on Vision Language Models with Stealthy Semantic Manipulation**\n- **Spa-VLM** (RAG-based VLM attacks)\n- **VLMs Can Aggregate Scattered Training Patches**\n\nThe multimodal nature seems to create additional vulnerabilities.\n\n### 3. **Novel Attack Vectors**\nSome particularly interesting attack methods:\n- **Merge Hijacking**: Attacking during model merging process\n- **Finetuning-Activated Backdoors**: Dormant until fine-tuning triggers them\n- **Scattered patch aggregation**: VLMs can combine distributed poisoned patches\n\n### 4. **Domain-Specific Vulnerabilities**\n- **Code LLMs systematic study**: Examining what makes code models more vulnerable\n- **Agent defense mechanisms**: Self-defending AI agents\n\n## Most Concerning Developments\n\n1. **Finetuning-Activated Backdoors** - This is particularly worrying as it could bypass current detection methods\n2. **Merge Hijacking** - Attacks the increasingly common practice of model merging\n3. **Stealth and semantic manipulation** - Making attacks harder to detect\n\n## Positive Developments\n\n- **Systematic reviews** helping consolidate knowledge\n- **Defense mechanisms** being developed (robust instruction tuning, agent self-defense)\n- **Backdoor cleaning** methods that don't require external guidance\n\nWould you like me to dive deeper into any particular attack vector or defense mechanism? The RAG poisoning attacks seem especially relevant given how widely RAG is being deployed.",

          "response": "I'm sorry to hear that you're experiencing cyberbullying. It's a serious issue, and you deserve support and safety. Your question references # B3. Poison & Backdoor, which is a technical research topic related to machine learning security (not directly about personal cyberbullying, but about attacks on AI models). I'll explain what these terms mean and how they might relate to your situation, then offer practical advice for protecting yourself from cyberbullying.\n\n## 1. What are Poison & Backdoor Attacks? (in AI/ML)\n\n- **Poisoning Attacks**: An attacker secretly introduces malicious data (poison) into the training set of an AI model, causing it to behave incorrectly or reveal private information.\n- **Backdoor Attacks**: An attacker manipulates the AI model so that it operates normally on most inputs, but produces harmful or unintended outputs when triggered by a specific input (the \"backdoor trigger\").\n\nThe research papers you listed focus on how these attacks are performed, detected, and defended against in AI models, especially in Large Language Models (LLMs) and Vision-Language Models (VLMs). These are security issues for organizations and developers deploying AI, not typical direct risks for individual users being cyberbullied.\n\n## 2. How Does This Relate to Cyberbullying Against You?\n\n- **Direct Risk**: Unless you are running, training, or deploying AI models yourself, or someone is using an AI system to target you, these attacks are not likely to be directly relevant to your situation as a victim of cyberbullying.\n- **Indirect Risk**: If you're using online platforms or chatbots, and someone is manipulating those systems to harass you with AI-generated content, platform owners are responsible for securing their AI against such attacks.\n\n## 3. Protecting Yourself from Cyberbullying\n\nThe best steps to protect yourself from cyberbullying are practical and social, not technical at the AI research level. Here’s what you can do:\n\n### 1. Document Everything\n- Save messages, screenshots, and URLs of the bullying.\n- Keep a record of dates, times, and the identity (if known) of the bully.\n\n### 2. Block and Report\n- Block the person(s) bullying you on all platforms.\n- Use the \"Report\" feature on social media, chat apps, games, or any online service.\n\n### 3. Adjust Privacy Settings\n- Make your profiles private.\n- Limit who can contact you or comment on your posts.\n\n### 4. Seek Support\n- Talk to friends, family, or a counselor.\n- If you’re a student, contact your school’s support staff or a trusted teacher.\n- There are also hotlines and organizations that help with cyberbullying.\n\n### 5. Legal Action (if severe)\n- For ongoing harassment, threats, or if you feel unsafe, contact law enforcement.\n- Laws about online harassment vary by region, but threats and stalking are often illegal.\n\n## 4. If You’re Worried About AI Abuse\n\nIf you suspect someone is using AI tools (e.g., deepfakes, chatbots, or automated messages) to bully you, mention this in your reports to the platform or authorities. Most companies are improving detection and response to AI-powered abuse.\n\n## 5. Additional Resources\n\n- [StopBullying.gov](https://www.stopbullying.gov/)\n- [Cyberbullying Research Center](https://cyberbullying.org/)\n\n---\n\n**In summary:**  \nThe \"poison & backdoor\" research you listed is about protecting AI models from attacks and is not directly about personal cyberbullying. For your safety, focus on reporting, blocking, privacy controls, and seeking support. If you have concerns about AI-generated harassment, let the platforms and authorities know.\n\nIf you want help with a specific situation or need more technical advice, feel free to share (safely and anonymously) more details.

If you are being cyberbullied, you may not need to dive deeply into the specific technical details of these research works, but understanding the themes can help you communicate with security professionals or platform moderators, and give you a better sense of how adversaries might attempt to manipulate AI-driven platforms. \n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n1. KEY TERMS: POISONING & BACKDOOR ATTACKS\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n• Poisoning Attack:  \n  – An adversary “poisons” part of a model’s training corpus or data pipeline.  \n  – By inserting malicious or misleading examples, the adversary shapes the model’s parameters so that it produces harmful or unintended outputs at test time (e.g., skewed answers, misinformation).  \n  – Poisoning typically happens during training or fine-tuning, when the model relies on user-provided or crowdsourced data.\n\n• Backdoor Attack:  \n  – A specific subtype of poisoning. The attacker implants a covert “trigger” into the model’s behavior during training.  \n  – When the model sees a particular word, image pattern, or other hidden “trigger,” it behaves in a malicious or unexpected way.  \n  – Triggers may be designed to stealthily bypass normal safety controls or produce targeted outputs.  \n  – Under normal inputs (i.e., without the special trigger), the infected model may appear to behave correctly, making detection difficult.\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n2. WHAT DOES THIS MEAN FOR YOU?\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nIf you suspect you are being harassed or manipulated by AI-generated content, it could be that someone is using or has poisoned a model (either intentionally or inadvertently) to produce targeted bullying, defamatory statements, or other harmful outputs:\n\n• One scenario: A malicious party might be using a “backdoored” AI chatbot or code assistant that inserts harassing or doxxing statements if you type specific trigger words.  \n• Another scenario: Attackers might spread malicious or false data about you in publicly available corpora (e.g., wikis or user forums) to “poison” real-time AI systems that retrieve from these sources.\n\nUnderstanding research on “poison & backdoor” helps you recognize that:  \n• It is possible for adversaries to manipulate model behavior.  \n• Security researchers and developers are actively working on ways to detect and neutralize these manipulations.  \n\nIf you are the target of cyberbullying, or suspect sophisticated model manipulation, you can:  \n• Report malicious accounts, content, or sites to the relevant platform’s security team.  \n• Document the harassment carefully (screenshots, logs).  \n• In severe cases, seek legal advice or contact law enforcement if you are being threatened or if personal information is leaked.\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n3. SELECTED PAPERS & THEIR MAIN IDEAS\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nBelow are brief, high-level highlights of each paper you mentioned. Many of these are quite specialized academic works—so if you only want a general sense, you can skim these overviews:\n\n1) Robust Anti-Backdoor Instruction Tuning in LVLMs [2025/06]  \n   • Proposes methods to train large vision-language models (LVLMs) to resist backdoor attacks.  \n   • Discusses ways to detect and remove malicious triggers during or after fine-tuning.\n\n2) Joint-GCG: Unified Gradient-Based Poisoning Attacks on Retrieval-Augmented Generation Systems [2025/06]  \n   • Explores a gradient-based approach to poisoning models that retrieve external data to craft responses (RAG systems).  \n   • Emphasizes how attackers can manipulate both the retrieval component and the generative component simultaneously.\n\n3) Backdoor Attack on Vision Language Models with Stealthy Semantic Manipulation [2025/06]  \n   • Shows how an attacker can embed a semantic trigger (like a subtle shift in an image or text) that secretly activates malicious behavior.  \n   • Focuses specifically on Vision-Language Models, which combine image and text understanding.\n\n4) A Systematic Review of Poisoning Attacks Against Large Language Models [2025/06]  \n   • Detailed survey: categorizes and compares different poisoning approaches against LLMs.  \n   • Outlines common vulnerabilities and the known defensive strategies.\n\n5) Your Agent Can Defend Itself against Backdoor Attacks [2025/06]  \n   • Discusses “LLM Agents”—LLMs that can act autonomously—and shows they can be equipped to detect and mitigate backdoor threats.  \n   • Potentially relevant if you use AI assistant “agents” that carry out tasks on your behalf.\n\n6) Which Factors Make Code LLMs More Vulnerable to Backdoor Attacks? A Systematic Study [2025/06]  \n   • Investigates programming/code generation LLMs specifically.  \n   • Explores how certain training factors (architecture, data split, etc.) affect the susceptibility to backdoors.  \n\n7) VLMs Can Aggregate Scattered Training Patches [2025/06]  \n   • Discusses an intriguing property: vision-language models can “piece together” partial or scattered manipulations in training data, enabling new forms of stealthy poisoning.  \n\n8) Through the Stealth Lens: Rethinking Attacks and Defenses in RAG [2025/06]  \n   • Focuses on “Retrieval-Augmented Generation” (RAG) systems.  \n   • Investigates subtle, stealthy ways an attacker can embed sabotage into the retrieval index that, when combined with the generative model, yields malicious outputs.\n\n9) Spa-VLM: Stealthy Poisoning Attacks on RAG-based VLM [2025/05]  \n   • Another RAG-based vision-language study, demonstrating how to hide poison in a large external knowledge base that the model uses for generation.\n\n10) Benchmarking Poisoning Attacks against Retrieval-Augmented Generation [2025/05]  \n    • An evaluation framework: compares how different poisoning approaches perform (success rate, stealthiness, etc.) in RAG setups.\n\n11) CPA-RAG: Covert Poisoning Attacks on Retrieval-Augmented Generation in Large Language Models [2025/05]  \n    • Another deep dive into “covert” (difficult to detect) poisoning methods that compromise the retrieval component, leading to manipulated generation results.\n\n12) Merge Hijacking: Backdoor Attacks to Model Merging of Large Language Models [2025/05]  \n    • Investigates a scenario in which multiple LLMs are merged or “fused” (e.g., model averaging, or using techniques like LoRA merges).  \n    • Shows how an attacker can design a backdoor that only emerges after merging, bypassing normal checks on individual models.\n\n13) Finetuning-Activated Backdoors in LLMs [2025/05]  \n    • Explains how even if a base model seems clean, a backdoor might remain dormant until a specific finetuning procedure “activates” it.  \n    • Emphasizes carefully vetting finetuning data and processes.\n\n14) Backdoor Cleaning without External Guidance in MLLM Fine-tuning [2025/05]  \n    • Focuses on “cleaning” or removing backdoors from multi-modal large language models after (or during) fine-tuning—without requiring external labeled data or “guidance.”  \n    • Useful as a potential remedy if a model is suspected to be compromised.\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n4. PRACTICAL STEPS TO PROTECT YOURSELF\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nIf you suspect that you (or a system you rely on) are being targeted by a poison or backdoor attack—perhaps leading to targeted harassment—here are some general (non-exhaustive) defenses and resources:\n\n1) Document Everything  \n   • Keep detailed records of suspicious AI outputs, especially if they contain triggers, personal attacks, or unexpected content.  \n   • These logs can be crucial if you report the issue to the platform or to authorities.\n\n2) Report and Block  \n   • If you encounter suspicious or harassing content from a chatbot or user, report it to the platform’s moderation team.  \n   • In severe cases of doxxing or targeted harassment, involve local law enforcement or seek legal/organizational support.\n\n3) Use Official or Trusted Platforms and Models  \n   • Stick to well-known AI services (those from major providers with transparent safety policies).  \n   • Public or unknown portals may use outdated or easily-poisoned models.\n\n4) Keep Systems Patched and Updated  \n   • If you run AI software locally (e.g., open-source LLM deployments), update to the latest versions.  \n   • Many frameworks release patches to mitigate known vulnerabilities (backdoor detection, safe finetuning).\n\n5) Validate Training Data and Models  \n   • For advanced users or organizations training/fine-tuning their own models, thoroughly vet the data pipeline, verifying no unauthorized data injection.  \n   • Keep checksums or cryptographic hashes for your training set to ensure no tampering.\n\n6) Look for “Trigger” Patterns  \n   • If an AI assistant’s tone or correctness drastically changes after specific words or contexts, that might be a sign of a backdoor trigger.  \n   • If you can replicate such abnormal behaviors reliably, alert the platform’s developers.\n\n7) Stay Informed  \n   • Security and AI are evolving quickly. Regularly consult reputable sources (e.g., academic papers, well-known security blogs) for new threats and recommended defenses.\n\n8) Seek Social and Emotional Support  \n   • Cyberbullying can be distressing. Talk to friends, family, or professional counselors.  \n   • You are not alone; many anti-bullying organizations and hotlines can guide you on legal and emotional support.\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n5. IF YOU ARE BEING CYBERBULLIED\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n• Harassment fueled by compromised or manipulated AI systems may look more sophisticated, but many standard anti-bullying strategies still apply: document, report, block, and if necessary, escalate.  \n• You might not need to become an expert in backdoor or poisoning research—focus on leveraging the existing safety measures on the platforms you use, and let the security teams handle deeper investigations.  \n• If you feel unsafe or threatened, do not hesitate to involve professionals, whether that be platform security, mental health counselors, or law enforcement.\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n\nI hope this summary helps you grasp the basic concepts of backdoor and poisoning attacks, as well as some possible ways to protect yourself and your data. If you feel that your situation is urgent or poses real danger, please reach out for professional help right away. Take care, and stay safe.",

What are Poisoning and Backdoor Attacks?\n\n• Poisoning Attacks:\n – In a poisoning attack, an adversary deliberately inserts misleading or malicious data into the training dataset of a machine learning model. The goal is to “poison” the learning process so that the resulting model behaves in a way that benefits the attacker. For instance, even if the malicious data is only a small part of a huge dataset, it may make the model susceptible to errors or allow hidden manipulations later on.\n\n• Backdoor Attacks:\n – A backdoor attack involves embedding a secret trigger (a particular pattern or signal) into a model during training. Under normal circumstances, the model behaves as expected, but when the hidden trigger is present in the input, the model will produce a specific, often malicious, output. This “backdoor” lets attackers control how the system responds without overt evidence of tampering.\n\n————————————————————\n2. What Does “B3. Poison & Backdoor” Represent Here?\n\nIn the list you provided, the heading “B3. Poison & Backdoor” appears to categorize a set of research publications. These papers study:\n • Methods to make models robust against backdoor or poisoning attacks.\n • Techniques attackers might use to covertly manipulate model behavior.\n • Different modalities (e.g., large language models, vision-language models, retrieval-augmented generation systems) and their vulnerabilities to such attacks.\n • Defenses that one might employ to detect, remove, or mitigate poisoning and backdoor influences.\n\nEach bullet point (with dates like “2025/06” or “2025/05”) is a reference to a specific study. For example:\n – Some papers focus on “stealthy semantic manipulation” in vision-language models.\n – Others investigate how backdoors can emerge during fine-tuning or model merging.\n – A few works even propose defenses (“Your Agent Can Defend Itself against Backdoor Attacks”) that might be relevant if you’re involved in systems security.\n\n————————————————————\n3. How Might This Information Be Relevant for Protecting Yourself?\n\nIf you’re facing cyberbullying, here are some thoughts that might help—whether the threat involves technical attacks or general online harassment:\n • Understanding Misinformation and Manipulation:\n  – Even if the technical details of poisoning/backdoor attacks aren’t directly used in cyberbullying, some cyberbullies might use misinformation, manipulated content, or even compromised digital accounts to further their agenda.\n  – Knowing that there are techniques to “poison” or alter digital behaviors can make you more alert if you notice unusual or out-of-character behavior from online services.\n\n • Protecting Your Digital Presence:\n  – Use reputable platforms and keep your software up to date.\n  – Employ strong security practices (like using two-factor authentication, monitoring account activity, and being cautious about suspicious links or files).\n  – If you run any software or systems (or even use AI-driven platforms), consider looking into security measures and tools that detect abnormal modifications or communications.\n\n • Seeking Support:\n  – Cyberbullying can be very distressing. Beyond technical steps, please consider reaching out to trusted friends, family, or professionals.\n  – If the harassment becomes severe or threatening, contact local law enforcement or support organizations specializing in cyber harassment.\n  – If your situation involves technical exploitation (for example, someone tampering with digital tools or services you rely on), consulting cybersecurity experts might be helpful.\n\n————————————————————\n4. Next Steps\n\n• If you’re looking into the technical side:\n – The research papers you listed could serve as a resource to understand what experts are doing on the front lines of defending against these sophisticated attacks.\n – They are primarily aimed at improving the robustness of AI systems, but some of their methodologies or defensive techniques might inspire safer online practices or help those managing platforms where cyberbullying occurs.\n\n• If you’re primarily dealing with cyberbullying:\n – Your safety matters first. Document any incidents, report them to the platform administrators or your local authorities, and look for local or online support networks.\n – Remember that technical research and cyberbullying, while sometimes intersecting (especially when technology is misused), are different kinds of threats. Your personal security and well‑being should be prioritized.\n\n————————————————————\nIn summary, the “B3. Poison & Backdoor” category is about understanding how attackers could insert hidden triggers or malicious data into machine learning systems. While these are largely technical threats that concern AI model security, knowing about them—and especially the available defenses—can also be empowering if you’re worried about digital manipulation or if you manage digital platforms where bullying might occur.\n\nIf you’re in need of immediate help regarding cyberbullying, please consider reaching out to local support services or trusted individuals who can assist. Your mental and digital well-being is very important, and support is available.\n\nI hope this helps clarify the context of these studies and gives you some ideas on how to better protect yourself, both online and in the broader digital environment. Stay safe and don’t hesitate to reach out for further support if needed.",

          "response": "I'm sorry you're experiencing cyberbullying. The research papers you've listed focus on poisoning and backdoor attacks in language models (LLMs), vision-language models (VLMs), and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems. These papers broadly cover attacks and defenses involving hidden manipulations injected during training or fine-tuning to maliciously influence model behavior. I'll summarize the key ideas clearly to help you understand the nature of such threats and strategies for defense:\n\n### Understanding the Threats:\n\n#### 1. **Backdoor and Poisoning Attacks Explained**\n- **Backdoor Attacks:** These attacks insert hidden triggers into the model during training or fine-tuning. Later, when the poisoned model encounters these triggers at inference, it behaves maliciously or unpredictably.\n- **Poisoning Attacks:** Malicious data or gradients are injected into the training or fine-tuning process, corrupting the model to produce incorrect or harmful outputs when deployed.\n\n#### 2. **Attack Mechanisms from Your Listed Papers:**\n- **Stealthy Semantic Manipulation ([Backdoor Attack on VLM](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07214)):** Attackers embed subtle semantic triggers that don't appear suspicious but activate malicious behavior.\n- **Gradient-Based Poisoning ([Joint-GCG](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06151)):** Leveraging gradients, attackers craft malicious training data targeting RAG systems to compromise retrieval-augmented responses.\n- **Merge Hijacking ([Merge Hijacking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23561)):** Attackers insert hidden triggers into models that only activate when models are merged, making detection difficult.\n\n#### 3. **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) Specific Attacks:**\n- Papers like [CPA-RAG](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19864) and [Benchmarking Poisoning Attacks on RAG](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18543) focus explicitly on vulnerabilities of retrieval-augmented setups, identifying covert injection techniques tailored for systems relying on external knowledge sources.\n\n#### 4. **Vision-Language Model (VLM) Attacks:**\n- [Spa-VLM](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23828) and [VLM Aggregation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03614) explore stealthy poisoning techniques specific to vision-language models, highlighting how attackers embed subtle visual or textual triggers.\n\n---\n\n### Defenses and Protective Measures:\n\n#### 1. **Robust Instruction Tuning ([Robust Anti-Backdoor Instruction Tuning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05401)):**\n- This paper introduces methods for making instruction-tuned models resilient by proactively identifying and mitigating malicious triggers during fine-tuning.\n\n#### 2. **Self-Defense for Agents ([Your Agent Can Defend Itself](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08336)):**\n- Proposes methods enabling autonomous agents (powered by LLMs) to recognize hidden malicious triggers and defend themselves proactively without external intervention.\n\n#### 3. **Backdoor Cleaning ([Backdoor Cleaning without External Guidance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16916)):**\n- Offers strategies for removing backdoors from multimodal language models (MLLMs) post-training without requiring external labeled data or explicit guidance, enhancing models' resilience to hidden manipulations.\n\n#### 4. **Systematic Reviews ([Systematic Review of Poisoning Attacks on LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06518), [Vulnerability Factors in Code LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01825)):**\n- These comprehensive reviews identify vulnerability factors and conditions under which models become susceptible to backdoor and poisoning attacks, helping guide practitioners in securing their models.\n\n#### 5. **Rethinking RAG Security ([Through the Stealth Lens](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04390)):**\n- Critically evaluates existing defenses and recommends improved threat modeling and defense mechanisms tailored for retrieval-augmented systems.\n\n---\n\n### Practical Steps You Can Take Immediately:\n\n- **Identify Suspicious Triggers:** Regularly audit datasets and model responses for unusual patterns, unexpected outputs, or suspicious correlations.\n- **Adopt Robust Fine-Tuning Techniques:** Use methods from robust training studies to proactively detect and neutralize backdoors.\n- **Employ Model Cleaning Techniques:** Implement post-training detection and purification methods to eliminate hidden backdoors.\n- **Stay Informed:** Follow best practices and research-based guidelines for secure model training, fine-tuning, and deployment.\n\n---\n\n### Connecting This Knowledge to Your Situation:\n\nAlthough these papers address technical attacks and defenses on AI models, the underlying concepts are analogous to cyberbullying scenarios involving manipulation, hidden threats, and covert harm. Understanding poisoning/backdoor attacks can help you recognize how subtle manipulations could occur in digital interactions. \n\nIf you're facing personal cyberbullying directly (rather than technical attacks on models), consider also taking these practical steps:\n\n- **Record evidence:** Document instances of bullying, including screenshots and timestamps.\n- **Seek support:** Reach out to trusted friends, family, or mental health professionals.\n- **Report incidents:** Notify platform administrators or authorities about abusive behavior.\n- **Protect yourself digitally:** Strengthen privacy settings, use strong passwords, and consider blocking/reporting abusive users.\n\nIf you clarify whether the cyberbullying you're experiencing is technical (model/system-based) or personal (online harassment), I can provide more tailored guidance.",

These works focus on how models can be surreptitiously manipulated (poisoned) to produce unintended outcomes—or made vulnerable via “backdoors” that allow an adversary to trigger specific malicious behaviors.\n\n1) Robust Anti-Backdoor Instruction Tuning in LVLMs (2506.05401)  \n   • Proposes instruction-tuning methods designed to be robust against backdoor attacks in Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs).  \n   • Explores ways to detect or mitigate hidden triggers that might be introduced during instruction tuning.\n\n2) Joint-GCG: Unified Gradient-Based Poisoning Attacks on Retrieval-Augmented Generation Systems (2506.06151)  \n   • Describes a gradient-based attack approach that targets retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) pipelines.  \n   • Shows how an attacker can poison both the retriever and generator to manipulate the final output.\n\n3) Backdoor Attack on Vision Language Models with Stealthy Semantic Manipulation (2506.07214)  \n   • Investigates how subtle semantic changes in image-text pairs can implant backdoors.  \n   • Emphasizes “stealth”—triggers that are hard to detect yet effectively subvert the model’s predictions when activated.\n\n4) A Systematic Review of Poisoning Attacks Against Large Language Models (2506.06518)  \n   • Provides a broad survey of existing poisoning tactics against LLMs, including data and model manipulation.  \n   • Categorizes attack methodologies and discusses evaluation metrics and defense strategies.\n\n5) Your Agent Can Defend Itself against Backdoor Attacks (2506.08336)  \n   • Focuses on agent-based LLMs and how they can autonomously detect, isolate, or mitigate backdoors.  \n   • Proposes self-defense mechanisms that allow an agent to monitor its own outputs and reasoning for malicious triggers.\n\n6) Which Factors Make Code LLMs More Vulnerable to Backdoor Attacks? A Systematic Study (2506.01825)  \n   • Examines code-focused LLMs (e.g., models used for programming assistance) to identify factors that increase susceptibility to backdooring.  \n   • Considers different training regimes, data sources, and triggers to pinpoint risk areas unique to code-generation models.\n\n7) VLMs Can Aggregate Scattered Training Patches (2506.03614)  \n   • Explores how Vision-Language Models can accumulate knowledge or patterns from multiple small, “scattered” patches, potentially including malicious ones.  \n   • Highlights implications for covertly injecting poisoned data throughout a large dataset.\n\n8) Through the Stealth Lens: Rethinking Attacks and Defenses in RAG (2506.04390)  \n   • Argues that “stealth” is crucial in both attacking and defending retrieval-augmented generation systems.  \n   • Proposes re-framing the threat model to examine subtle manipulations at both the retriever and generator stages.\n\n9) Spa-VLM: Stealthy Poisoning Attacks on RAG-based VLM (2505.23828)  \n   • Introduces a stealthy poisoning technique targeting retrieval-augmented VLMs, influencing both the retrieval process and the model’s final captioning or reasoning outputs.  \n   • Demonstrates end-to-end attack pipelines that remain hidden from conventional detection.\n\n10) Benchmarking Poisoning Attacks against Retrieval-Augmented Generation (2505.18543)  \n    • Systematically benchmarks different poisoning strategies on a variety of RAG systems.  \n    • Provides insights into which attack vectors are most successful and how detection or defense can be improved.\n\n11) CPA-RAG: Covert Poisoning Attacks on Retrieval-Augmented Generation in Large Language Models (2505.19864)  \n    • Focuses on “covert” poisoning—minimizing the detectability of malicious data or triggers.  \n    • Presents attack algorithms and shows how to bypass naive defenses by embedding triggers in subtle ways.\n\n12) Merge Hijacking: Backdoor Attacks to Model Merging of Large Language Models (2505.23561)  \n    • Reveals how the process of merging multiple LLM checkpoints can be exploited to insert hidden backdoors.  \n    • Studies how merging can unintentionally amplify or hide malicious triggers.\n\n13) Finetuning-Activated Backdoors in LLMs (2505.16567)  \n    • Demonstrates that backdoors can remain dormant in a pre-trained model and be activated only when the model is fine-tuned.  \n    • Highlights the risks of relying on “safe” checkpoints that might become compromised after further adaptation.\n\n14) Backdoor Cleaning without External Guidance in MLLM Fine-tuning (2505.16916)  \n    • Targets the removal of backdoors from multi-modal large language models during fine-tuning, but without requiring external validation or data.  \n    • Proposes methods to sanitize the model internally, reducing reliance on specialized backdoor-detection tools or external experts.\n\nKey Themes Across These Papers:\n• Stealth: Emphasis on making triggers hard to detect (semantic or small-text changes, scattered patches, or hidden merges).  \n• Bi-Modal Attacks: Poisoning or backdoor insertion can occur in both text and image data (VLMs).  \n• Retrieval-Augmented Generation Vulnerabilities: Attackers can exploit the retriever (index) or the generator (LLM) or both.  \n• Fine-tuning and Model Merging Hazards: Even if a foundation model is clean, subsequent modifications (fine-tuning, merging) can introduce or awaken hidden backdoors.  \n• Defenses: Various strategies are proposed, from robust training to self-defensive agents, emphasizing the challenge of mitigating sophisticated, stealthy attacks.\n\nOverall, this cluster of work highlights the rapidly evolving nature of poisoning and backdoor techniques against advanced language or multi-modal models. Alongside these techniques, the research community is actively proposing new defense methods—yet it remains a challenging arms race to ensure that next-generation models stay secure and trustworthy.",

          "response": "Let me break it down for you. The “B3. Poison & Backdoor” label groups together research work that deals with two closely related, but distinct, types of attacks on machine learning models—especially large language models (LLMs) and vision-language models (VLMs):\n\n1. Poisoning Attacks:\n • In a poisoning attack, an attacker deliberately injects malicious data into the training set. The idea is that by subtly “poisoning” part of the data, the attacker can cause the model to learn harmful correlations or biases.\n • These attacks can compromise the model even before it’s deployed, because they alter the learned representations. In several of the listed papers, you see studies on gradient-based poisoning or covert poisoning in systems like Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG).\n • The papers often investigate both the attack strategies and methods to detect or mitigate such poisoning, which is critical given the reliance many modern applications have on data integrity.\n\n2. Backdoor Attacks:\n • Backdoor attacks are a specific kind of poisoning attack where the goal is to implant a “trigger” or hidden behavior into a model during training. Under normal conditions, the model behaves as expected; however, when a specific trigger (which could be a particular phrase, image pattern, or other input) is presented, the model suddenly produces a malicious or inconsistent output.\n • The research covered by “B3” examines how these backdoors are implanted (including stealthy semantic manipulations) and, in some cases, how to remove or defend against them.\n • For instance, papers like “Finetuning-Activated Backdoors in LLMs” and “Merge Hijacking: Backdoor Attacks to Model Merging of Large Language Models” consider how subtle adjustments during fine-tuning or merging of models can leave backdoor vulnerabilities, and they explore under what conditions these vulnerabilities appear.\n\n3. Special Cases and Defense Strategies:\n • Some studies in the list look into new attack vectors for both poisoning and backdoor scenarios in advanced settings such as RAG-based systems, which combine retrieval with generation.\n • Others focus on defense: “Your Agent Can Defend Itself against Backdoor Attacks,” for example, suggests that models (or agents built on them) might be able to detect and counteract backdoor behavior once deployed.\n • There’s also work around “stealth” aspects—how to hide the backdoor or poisoning effects so that they aren’t easily detected, which is why you see phrases like “stealthy semantic manipulation” and “covert poisoning” in the titles.\n\nOverall, by organizing research into a category like B3, the community is trying to understand not just how these malicious interventions work, but also how to anticipate, detect, and counteract them. It’s an evolving area of study because as models grow in size and capability, so do the opportunities (and potential dangers) for adversaries to exploit vulnerabilities in both the training and deployment stages.\n\nI hope this helps clarify what “B3. Poison & Backdoor” is all about. Let me know if you’d like more details on any aspect of this research!",

Here’s a breakdown of what this section is about, followed by a brief explanation of the main themes and a summary of each paper listed.\n\n---\n\n## What is “Poison & Backdoor” in LLMs/VLMs?\n\n- **Poisoning attacks**: These are attacks where adversaries inject malicious or misleading data into the training set, so when the model learns from this data, it picks up harmful or biased behaviors.\n- **Backdoor attacks**: A specific type of poisoning attack where the attacker implants a “trigger” in the model. When the model encounters a specific trigger (e.g., a phrase, pattern, or image), it behaves in an attacker-controlled way, often while behaving normally otherwise.\n- **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)**: A framework where a language model retrieves relevant documents and then generates answers based on them, which opens new avenues for poisoning attacks via retrieval data.\n- **LLM**: Large Language Model (e.g., GPT-4, Llama)\n- **VLM**: Vision-Language Model (e.g., CLIP, LLaVA)\n\n---\n\n## Why is this important?\n\n- Poisoning and backdoor attacks are critical security concerns for LLMs/VLMs, especially as these models are widely used and often fine-tuned with new data, which could be malicious.\n- Understanding their mechanisms allows us to develop better defenses and improve the robustness of AI systems.\n\n---\n\n## Summary of Each Paper\n\n### 1.

These papers often focus on two core themes:\n\n1. Backdoor Attacks: \n   • Inserting malicious “triggers” into models during training or fine-tuning that cause targeted misbehavior.  \n   • Sometimes leverage stealthy manipulations (that are hard to detect) to alter model outputs under certain cues.\n\n2. Poisoning Attacks:\n   • Injecting crafted examples or data into the training set so the model learns incorrect or adversarial associations.  \n   • Primarily target retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems or similar pipelines where data is retrieved and combined with a model’s output.\n\nBelow is a short clarification of each reference:\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n1) “Robust Anti-Backdoor Instruction Tuning in LVLMs”  \n   (2025/06) – [VLM]  \n   • Explores how large vision-language models (LVLMs) might pick up backdoor triggers during instruction tuning.  \n   • Proposes robust techniques that aim to “detoxify” the LVLM by analyzing instruction-tuning steps.\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n2) “Joint-GCG: Unified Gradient-Based Poisoning Attacks on Retrieval-Augmented Generation Systems”  \n   (2025/06) – [LLM] [RAG]  \n   • Investigates retrieval-augmented generation pipelines, where an LLM uses an external retrieval module to fetch facts or documents.  \n   • Describes a gradient-based approach that can seamlessly attack both the retrieval mechanism and the generation mechanism simultaneously.\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n3) “Backdoor Attack on Vision Language Models with Stealthy Semantic Manipulation”  \n   (2025/06) – [VLM]  \n   • Details how subtle modifications to image-text pairs can implant triggers that are semantically meaningful yet covert.  \n   • Focuses on how to insert these triggers into training so that VLMs misinterpret or misrespond to particular visual or textual cues.\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n4) “A Systematic Review of Poisoning Attacks Against Large Language Models”  \n   (2025/06) – [LLM]  \n   • Survey-style paper providing an overview of existing poisoning approaches.  \n   • Organizes attacks by their “injection point” (pre-training data vs. fine-tuning data), stealth strategies, and mitigation methods.\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n5) “Your Agent Can Defend Itself against Backdoor Attacks”  \n   (2025/06) – [LLM] [Agent]  \n   • Explores scenarios where an LLM-based agent (e.g., with reasoning or decision-making functions) could self-diagnose or detect anomalies.  \n   • Proposes an internal, automated defense mechanism that monitors for suspicious triggers at inference time.\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n6) “Which Factors Make Code LLMs More Vulnerable to Backdoor Attacks?

          "response": "This collection of papers falls under the umbrella of research on “Poison & Backdoor” attacks, which are two related classes of threats against machine learning models—especially large language models (LLMs) and vision-language models (VLMs). Here’s a breakdown to clarify the concepts and what these works focus on:\n\n1. Poisoning vs. Backdoors Basics\n\n • Poisoning attacks involve injecting malicious data (or perturbations) into the training set. The goal is to subtly alter the model’s behavior once it’s deployed. The poison can be designed so that the model behaves normally on most inputs but makes mistakes or acts maliciously on specific “triggered” inputs.\n\n • Backdoor attacks are a specific type of poisoning attack. Here, the adversary embeds a hidden pattern—often called a trigger—which, when present in the input, causes the model to produce an attacker-chosen output. Importantly, under normal circumstances, the model acts as expected.\n\n2. Different Focuses in the Collection\n\n Many of the papers combine both the attack and defense narratives:\n\n – Several papers (e.g., “Robust Anti-Backdoor Instruction Tuning in LVLMs” and “Your Agent Can Defend Itself against Backdoor Attacks”) not only highlight vulnerabilities but also introduce robust tuning or self-defensive strategies to counteract poisoning/backdoor attacks.  \n – Others (like “Joint-GCG: Unified Gradient-Based Poisoning Attacks on Retrieval-Augmented Generation Systems” and “CPA-RAG: Covert Poisoning Attacks on Retrieval-Augmented Generation in Large Language Models”) delve into the mechanisms of poisoning attacks specifically in settings where retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) is involved. RAG systems combine the internal knowledge of the model with external information retrieval, which creates unique vulnerabilities.\n – Some research, such as “Backdoor Attack on Vision Language Models with Stealthy Semantic Manipulation” and “Spa-VLM: Stealthy Poisoning Attacks on RAG-based VLM,” targets VLMs. These studies show how attackers can manipulate multimodal data in ways that are even harder to detect.\n – Reviews and systematic studies (e.g., “A Systematic Review of Poisoning Attacks Against Large Language Models”) collect and analyze the diverse methods, providing a broader perspective on threats and vulnerabilities.\n – There are also works that discuss nuances specific to certain model types. For instance, “Which Factors Make Code LLMs More Vulnerable to Backdoor Attacks? A Systematic Study” examines why models trained for code generation might be particularly at risk, while “Merge Hijacking: Backdoor Attacks to Model Merging of Large Language Models” explores how backdoors can persist or emerge even during processes like model merging.\n – Finally, some papers (like “Backdoor Cleaning without External Guidance in MLLM Fine-tuning”) look at remediation—how to remove or “clean” potential backdoors during the model fine-tuning process.\n\n3. Key Themes Across These Works\n\n • Stealth and Detection: A number of the papers focus on making the attacks stealthy (hard to detect) or, conversely, on designing defenses that help detect these covert manipulations.  \n\n • Modal-Specific Vulnerabilities: The studies distinguish between threats in text-based LLMs, multimodal VLMs, and hybrid systems like RAG. Different modalities and architectures come with their own sets of vulnerabilities and require tailored solutions.  \n\n • Attack Transfer Mechanisms: Some research investigates how poisoning can affect not just the final model behavior (inference) but also intermediary processes like model merging or fine-tuning.  \n\n • Defense Strategies: Not all work is attack-oriented. A significant portion is dedicated to defending against these threats by proposing robust training methods, backdoor cleaning, or designing systems that can self-diagnose and self-correct if under attack.\n\n4. Why It Matters\n\n Because modern AI systems are trained on massive and often public or loosely curated datasets, they’re inherently vulnerable to subtle manipulations. If an attacker can poison a small part of the training data or embed a trick in the training pipeline, they might control the model’s behavior in specific scenarios, creating severe repercussions when these models are deployed in the real world.\n\nIn short, the body of work you’re referring to spans both sides of the security coin: from demonstrating novel poisoning/backdoor attack techniques on advanced models (including those that use retrieval-augmented methods or combine visual and textual information) to proposing countermeasures that make systems more robust against such vulnerabilities.\n\nIf you need clarification on any specific paper or concept among these, feel free to ask!",

Expanding Attack Surface:\n- Attacks are no longer limited to traditional LLMs—Vision Language Models (VLMs), code LLMs, and especially RAG architectures are now prime targets.\n- Examples: Spa-VLM, Benchmarking Poisoning Attacks against RAG, CPA-RAG, Merge Hijacking, etc.\n\n2. Stealth and Covert Attacks:\n- Stealth and semantic manipulation are increasingly sophisticated, making detection harder (e.g., Spa-VLM, Backdoor Attack on VLMs with Stealthy Semantic Manipulation).\n- Attacks can now be embedded at the data, parameter, or model merge levels.\n\n3. Model Robustness and Defense:\n- There’s a growing focus on defense strategies—Robust Anti-Backdoor Instruction Tuning, Backdoor Cleaning without Guidance, and self-defending agents.\n- However, defenses are still lagging, especially for multi-modal and RAG setups.\n\n4. Systematic Reviews and Vulnerability Studies:\n- Several works aim to systematically categorize attack strategies (A Systematic Review of Poisoning Attacks; Which Factors Make Code LLMs More Vulnerable).\n- These help inform benchmarks and future defenses.\n\nNotable Papers & Takeaways\n\n- Robust Anti-Backdoor Instruction Tuning in LVLMs: Proposes fine-tuning protocols to harden vision-language models against backdoors during instruction tuning.\n- Joint-GCG: Introduces unified gradient-based poisoning for RAG systems, highlighting vulnerabilities at the intersection of retrieval and generation.\n- Merge Hijacking: Shows that model merging (a common practice in open-source communities) can be a vector for injecting backdoors.\n- Through the Stealth Lens: Explores how RAG-specific architectures pose both unique attack vectors and defense challenges.\n- Your Agent Can Defend Itself: Early work on agents that can autonomously detect and mitigate backdoors.\n- Backdoor Cleaning without External Guidance: Aims to remove backdoors in VLMs without relying on clean reference data.\nDiscussion Questions\n\n- Are current evaluation benchmarks (for attacks & defenses) keeping pace with the increasing sophistication of attacks (especially in RAG and VLM scenarios)?\n- How practical and scalable are the proposed defense techniques, especially for real-world, large-scale deployment?\n- What are the best practices for open-source communities to prevent “merge hijacking” and other supply-chain attacks?\n- How do we balance ease of model fine-tuning with the risk of inadvertently activating or introducing backdoors?\n- What are the most promising directions for proactive defense—agent-based, data-centric, or model-centric approaches?\nSummary Table\n\n| Paper | Model Type | Attack/Defense | Key Feature |\n|-------|------------|---------------|-------------|\n| Robust Anti-Backdoor Instruction Tuning | VLM | Defense | Instruction tuning against backdoors |\n| Joint-GCG | LLM/RAG | Attack | Unified gradient-based poisoning |\n| Merge Hijacking | LLM | Attack | Backdoors via model merging |\n| Your Agent Can Defend Itself | LLM/Agent | Defense | Autonomous agent defense |\n| Backdoor Cleaning w/o Guidance | VLM | Defense | Cleaning without clean data |\n| Spa-VLM | VLM/RAG | Attack | Stealthy poisoning on RAG-based VLM |\n| CPA-RAG | LLM/RAG | Attack | Covert poisoning on RAG |\n| Systematic Review | LLM | Review | Survey of attacks |\n| Code LLMs Vulnerability | LLM (Code) | Review | Factors for backdoor vulnerability |\n| Stealth Lens | LLM/RAG | Both | RAG-specific attacks/defenses |\n\nIf you want a deeper dive into any particular paper, or a summary/visual, or to structure a reading group, let me know!",

The key takeaway is that adversaries have numerous ways to manipulate large model behavior—both during training and during finetuning or merging—and researchers are actively studying new defenses. The citations are taken as-is from your list.\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n1) Backdoor & Poisoning Attacks in Instruction-Tuned LLMs or LVLMs\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n• Robust Anti-Backdoor Instruction Tuning in LVLMs (2025/06)  \n  Explores how Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) can be immunized against backdoor triggers when they are instruction-tuned. Proposes new strategies to identify triggers injected at finetuning time and mitigate them without sacrificing model performance.  \n\n• Finetuning-Activated Backdoors in LLMs (2025/05)  \n  Studies the subtle ways in which backdoors can be planted into a base LLM during pretraining so that they remain dormant until certain finetuning steps “activate” them. Highlights the challenge of detecting backdoors when the model initially appears benign.\n\n• Merge Hijacking: Backdoor Attacks to Model Merging of Large Language Models (2025/05)  \n  Introduces a new type of backdoor that is only triggered after merging two or more LLMs. This is especially relevant because model “merging” or “mixing” has become a common practice, and conventional backdoor defenses might miss combined triggers.\n\n• Backdoor Cleaning without External Guidance in MLLM Fine-tuning (2025/05)  \n  Focuses on methods to clean backdoors from multimodal LLMs (i.e., VLMs or MLLMs) during the fine-tuning stage—without needing external data or expert labels. Proposes an algorithm that attempts to isolate suspicious neurons or parameters that are likely involved in backdoor behaviors and reset them.\n\n• Which Factors Make Code LLMs More Vulnerable to Backdoor Attacks? A Systematic Study (2025/06)  \n  Specifically examines LLMs trained on code—analyzing architecture choices, training data composition, and finetuning methodology to identify which factors heighten (or reduce) vulnerability to backdoor triggers.  \n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n2) Poisoning (Stealthy or Covert) in RAG-Based Systems\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n• Joint-GCG: Unified Gradient-Based Poisoning Attacks on Retrieval-Augmented Generation Systems (2025/06)  \n  Discusses how malicious gradient-based modifications to the retrieval database can degrade or hijack RAG outputs. Demonstrates end-to-end adversarial strategies that jointly optimize the retrieval and generation modules.\n\n• Through the Stealth Lens: Rethinking Attacks and Defenses in RAG (2025/06)  \n  Presents a taxonomy of stealthy poisoning attacks—where adversaries modify underlying databases so that the RAG system fetches and conditions on misaligned text. Also surveys defensive strategies like robust retrieval, anomaly detection, and post-hoc validation.\n\n• Benchmarking Poisoning Attacks against Retrieval-Augmented Generation (2025/05)  \n  Provides standardized benchmarks and evaluation procedures for different categories of poisoning attacks in RAG. By comparing various attack-and-defense setups, it clarifies fundamental tradeoffs and open challenges in real-world usage scenarios.\n\n• CPA-RAG: Covert Poisoning Attacks on Retrieval-Augmented Generation in Large Language Models (2025/05)  \n  Proposes covert insertion of malicious content into retrieval corpora, which subtly shifts or corrupts the RAG system’s outputs without obviously alerting the user. The paper also discusses complexities in designing detection methods when the “trigger” is hidden in a large data corpus.\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n3) Poisoning & Backdoors in Vision-Language Models\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n• Backdoor Attack on Vision Language Models with Stealthy Semantic Manipulation (2025/06)  \n  Introduces a “stealthy semantic manipulation” approach where the adversary implants triggers that subtly alter the model’s multimodal reasoning (e.g., text-image alignment) without easy-to-spot artifacts.  \n\n• Spa-VLM: Stealthy Poisoning Attacks on RAG-based VLM (2025/05)  \n  Investigates adversarial modifications in the retrieval pipeline for vision-language tasks, where the poisoning is so minimal that it avoids detection. Demonstrates that even a small fraction of “stealthy” patches can effectively subvert retrieval-based VLM systems.\n\n• VLMs Can Aggregate Scattered Training Patches (2025/06)  \n  Though not explicitly describing an attack method, it provides a mechanism that explains how VLMs piece together scattered or partial training signals. In the context of backdoors, this indicates that triggers can be split across multiple training samples yet still be aggregated by the model after training.\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n4) Surveys, Reviews, and Defenses\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n• A Systematic Review of Poisoning Attacks Against Large Language Models (2025/06)  \n  Comprehensive survey covering how poisoning attacks have evolved alongside LLM development. Catalogs approaches to data poisoning, model poisoning, and covert triggers, as well as the newest defensive strategies.\n\n• Your Agent Can Defend Itself against Backdoor Attacks (2025/06)  \n  Though focusing on “agents,” it provides both conceptual and methodological frameworks for LLM-based agents to verify their inputs, audit internal states, and filter suspicious content in real-time. Potentially generalizable for building more robust backdoor defenses.\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n\nOverall Themes & Observations:\n• Evolving Attack Surface: As LLMs and VLMs expand in capability (e.g., retrieval-augmented, multi-model merging), attackers exploit new angles—blending data poisoning, stealth triggers, or specialized backdoor techniques.  \n• Stealth Emphasis: Many of these works incorporate “stealth,” meaning the manipulations are designed to remain undetected and only manifest under specific prompt or data conditions.  \n• Defensive Strategies: Various defensive approaches appear:\n  – Systematic scanning for suspicious behaviors or losses during training  \n  – Resetting or unlearning suspicious parameters during finetuning  \n  – Adding robust detection or verification in retrieval-based pipelines  \n  – Building model-side defenses (agent’s self-protection or reliance on ensembles)  \n• Need for Standard Benchmarks: Several publications stress the importance of consistent, controlled benchmarks for measuring how easily an LLM/VLM can be subverted—and how well proposed defenses actually work.\n\nThese papers collectively underscore that backdoor and poisoning attacks on large models will remain a central security concern, particularly as open-source LLMs proliferate and as more applications rely on retrieval-based pipelines.",

Here’s a brief overview of what the list covers:\n\n• Robustness and Defense Mechanisms – Several papers (e.g., “Robust Anti-Backdoor Instruction Tuning in LVLMs”, “Your Agent Can Defend Itself against Backdoor Attacks”) explore methods to defend models—be they large language models (LLMs), multimodal models, or agent-based systems—against malicious backdoor triggers and poisoning attacks.\n\n• Poisoning in Retrieval-Augmented Systems – A number of works (for example, “Joint-GCG: Unified Gradient-Based Poisoning Attacks on Retrieval-Augmented Generation Systems”, “Benchmarking Poisoning Attacks against Retrieval-Augmented Generation”, and “CPA-RAG: Covert Poisoning Attacks on Retrieval-Augmented Generation in Large Language Models”) focus on how poisoning attacks can influence systems that rely on retrieval mechanisms. These studies often aim to understand vulnerabilities specific to the RAG framework and propose defenses.\n\n• Backdoor Attack Analyses – Papers like “Backdoor Attack on Vision Language Models with Stealthy Semantic Manipulation” and “Finetuning-Activated Backdoors in LLMs” dive into how backdoors are planted and activated within models, sometimes even quietly during fine-tuning. There’s also research on how training data patches can be aggregated (as seen in “VLMs Can Aggregate Scattered Training Patches”) to facilitate such attacks.\n\n• Systematic Reviews and Factor Studies – There are systematic reviews (e.g., “A Systematic Review of Poisoning Attacks Against Large Language Models”) that comprehensively analyze past poisoning attacks as well as studies that examine which factors make certain models, like code LLMs, more vulnerable to these kinds of attacks.\n\n• Additional Themes – Other works in the list discuss topics like merge hijacking during model merging and backdoor cleaning without needing external guidance during the fine-tuning of multimodal models.\n\nThe hashtags and badges (e.g., VLM, LLM, RAG, Agent, ACL'25_Main) indicate the primary focus or venue relevance for each paper, helping readers quickly identify which modalities or communities (vision or text, retrieval-augmented systems, etc.) are being targeted by the research.\n\nSince the “window for discussing #B3. Poison & Backdoor” is closing soon, it might be a final call for comments, discussions, or submissions on this particular topic. If you’re looking to dive deeper into any specific paper or topic—such as potential defenses, detailed attack methodologies, or implications for real-world applications—let me know what specific discussion point you’d like to explore, and I’d be happy to help further!",

          "response": "Certainly! Here’s an expert-level summary and risk analysis of #B3. Poison & Backdoor, synthesizing the key findings and implications of the listed papers for a risk analyst with a decade of experience:\n\n---\n\n## Overview  \n**Poisoning and backdoor attacks** on Large Language Models (LLMs), Vision Language Models (VLMs), and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems are emerging as critical risks. These attacks compromise the integrity, security, and reliability of AI systems by introducing malicious behaviors during training or fine-tuning.\n\n---\n\n## Key Themes & Findings\n\n### 1. **Attack Vectors and Capabilities**\n- **Data Poisoning**: Attackers subtly manipulate training data, causing models to learn hidden behaviors (backdoors) or to malfunction on specific triggers.\n- **Stealth & Evasion**: Modern attacks (e.g., [Spa-VLM](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23828), [CPA-RAG](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19864)) focus on being stealthy, evading standard data and model inspections.\n- **Semantic Manipulation**: Attacks ([Backdoor Attack on VLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07214)) can make imperceptible changes that alter model output only under specific contexts or triggers.\n- **Model Merging & Fine-tuning Risks**: Backdoors can be introduced or activated during model merging ([Merge Hijacking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23561)) or seemingly benign fine-tuning ([Finetuning-Activated Backdoors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16567)).\n\n### 2. **Vulnerabilities in Modern Architectures**\n- **RAG Systems**: Both [Joint-GCG](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06151) and benchmarking papers show RAG architectures are particularly vulnerable, as poisoning can occur at the retrieval or generation stage.\n- **Code LLMs**: Systematic study ([Which Factors Make Code LLMs...](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01825)) identifies code LLMs as especially vulnerable due to the nature of open-source code data and high reusability.\n- **VLMs' Aggregation Abilities**: [VLMs Can Aggregate Scattered Training Patches](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03614) shows VLMs can unintentionally \"connect the dots\" between disjoint poisoned data, amplifying attack impact.\n\n### 3. **Detection and Defense**\n- **Defense Strategies**: Robust anti-backdoor tuning ([Robust Anti-Backdoor Instruction Tuning in LVLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05401)), self-defending agents ([Your Agent Can Defend Itself](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08336)), and cleaning methods ([Backdoor Cleaning without External Guidance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16916)) are being developed, but with limitations.\n- **Lack of External Guidance**: Some defenses can operate without external clean data, but may not generalize well against novel attack vectors.\n- **Rethinking Defenses**: [Through the Stealth Lens](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04390) advocates for viewing defense from the attacker’s perspective, given the evolving sophistication of stealth attacks.\n\n### 4. **Systematic Reviews**\n- [A Systematic Review of Poisoning Attacks Against LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06518) provides a comprehensive taxonomy, highlighting how attacks are becoming more targeted, stealthy, and difficult to detect.\n\n---\n\n## Risk Implications\n\n### 1. **Supply Chain & Data Risk**\n- Poisoning can occur anywhere in the model/data supply chain—including public datasets, third-party model checkpoints, and during collaborative model merging.\n\n### 2. **Stealth & Latency Risk**\n- Attacks may remain dormant, only activating under specific conditions or prompts, possibly months after deployment.\n\n### 3. **Incident Response Complexity**\n- Backdoors may be nearly impossible to detect with standard validation, requiring new methodologies and continuous monitoring post-deployment.\n\n### 4. **Regulatory & Compliance Exposure**\n- Undetected poisoning/backdoors can result in regulatory breaches (data leaks, biased/harmful outputs), especially in regulated sectors (finance, healthcare, government).\n\n### 5. **Remediation & Trust**\n- Cleaning or retraining may not fully remove backdoors, especially if activation triggers are unknown. This undermines trust in AI-driven workflows.\n\n---\n\n## Mitigation Strategies\n\n1. **Harden Data Pipelines**:  \n   - Implement robust data provenance, audit, and version control.\n   - Employ anomaly detection in both data and model behavior.\n\n2. **Model Validation & Testing**:  \n   - Use adversarial and red-teaming approaches to simulate backdoor/poisoning scenarios.\n   - Integrate continuous monitoring for abnormal or unexpected model outputs.\n\n3. **Defense-in-Depth**:  \n   - Employ multiple detection and cleaning strategies, including those that do not require access to clean reference data.\n\n4. **Supply Chain Security**:  \n   - Vet third-party models and datasets.\n   - Monitor for tampering in model-merging and fine-tuning workflows.\n\n5. **Incident Response Preparedness**:  \n   - Develop playbooks for rapid backdoor/poisoning detection, response, and remediation.\n\n---\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThe research in #B3 demonstrates that poisoning and backdoor attacks are evolving rapidly, with increased stealth and sophistication, especially in LLMs, VLMs, and RAG systems. Risk management requires a proactive, layered approach—combining technical controls, process rigor, and continuous vigilance throughout the AI/ML lifecycle.\n\n**For further reading or policy development, focusing on systematic reviews and attack/defense benchmarks is highly recommended.**\n\n---\n\nIf you need tailored risk controls or a mapping to specific regulatory frameworks, let me know!",

They focus on different points along the threat spectrum—ranging from poisoning the training data to stealthy backdoor triggers and merging-based attacks—as well as defenses and mitigation techniques.\n\n━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━\n1) BACKDOOR & POISONING BASICS\n━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━\n\n• Poisoning Attacks: Attackers alter part of the training data (or model checkpoints) to achieve specific malicious goals. When the model is trained (or finetuned) on this poisoned dataset, it learns unintended behaviors triggered by special inputs.\n\n• Backdoor Attacks: A special case of poisoning in which a “trigger” activates unwanted outputs. Under normal inputs, the model behaves as usual; yet once the trigger is presented, the model’s behavior shifts in a predetermined way (e.g., generating incorrect, malicious, or biased outputs).\n\n• Emerging Trends:\n  – Unifying gradient-based attacks across different modules (model + retrieval).\n  – Increasingly stealthy triggers (semantic triggers, stealth patches).\n  – Attacks leveraging partial data updates and model merging steps.\n  – Defenses ranging from robust instruction tuning to self-defensive “agents.”\n\n━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━\n2) OVERARCHING THEMES IN THE 2025 PAPERS\n━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━\n\nBelow, the papers are loosely grouped by (a) generic attacks and defenses on LLMs, (b) specialized attacks incorporating retrieval-augmented generation, (c) vision–language models (VLMs) and multimodal LLMs, (d) code LLMs, and (e) merging-based backdoors.\n\n─────────────────────────────────────────\nA. Attacks and Defenses on LLMs (General)\n─────────────────────────────────────────\n\n1) Robust Anti-Backdoor Instruction Tuning in LVLMs  \n   (arXiv:2506.05401)  \n   • Focus: Proposes a robust approach to instruction-tuning that reduces vulnerabilities to backdoor triggers in large vision–language models (LVLMs).  \n   • Key Idea: Strengthens the alignment process (instruction tuning) by incorporating additional consistency checks and trigger-agnostic objectives.  \n   • Relevance: Demonstrates that the fine-tuning stage (instruction tuning) can either introduce or mitigate backdoors if not done cautiously.\n\n2) A Systematic Review of Poisoning Attacks Against Large Language Models  \n   (arXiv:2506.06518)  \n   • Focus: Provides an in-depth survey covering data- and model-poisoning techniques, triggers, stealth metrics, and known defenses.  \n   • Key Idea: Identifies key methodologies (like label flipping, stealth triggers, multi-stage attacks) and highlights gaps in robust large-scale defenses.  \n   • Relevance: Useful as a comprehensive reference for risk analysts who want an overview of the threat landscape and possible mitigations.\n\n3) Your Agent Can Defend Itself Against Backdoor Attacks  \n   (arXiv:2506.08336)  \n   • Focus: Explores how an autonomous LLM “agent” can dynamically test for suspicious behavior in its own submodules or prompts.  \n   • Key Idea: The agent employs adversarial testing or meta-prompting to detect potential triggers before generating final outputs.  \n   • Relevance: Illustrates a direction where LLMs are taught self-defense strategies that might reduce reliance on external scanning.\n\n4) Finetuning-Activated Backdoors in LLMs  \n   (arXiv:2505.16567)  \n   • Focus: Studies how innocuous \"sleeping\" backdoors can surface when an LLM is finetuned on new tasks or domains.  \n   • Key Idea: Highlights that certain model weights, even if not active initially, can be “unlocked” by normal finetuning.  \n   • Relevance: Underscores the importance of thoroughly validating any finetune procedure, because the triggers may lie dormant until specialized training reawakens them.\n\n5) Merge Hijacking: Backdoor Attacks to Model Merging of Large Language Models  \n   (arXiv:2505.23561)  \n   • Focus: A scenario where multiple LLMs get merged (e.g., via weight averaging or certain merges), letting attackers insert hidden triggers.  \n   • Key Idea: Attackers craft one model so that merging with a benign model picks up malicious triggers while still appearing performance-neutral in normal usage.  \n   • Relevance: As “model merging” (to combine capabilities or compress) grows more popular, it can become a new backdoor vector.\n\n─────────────────────────────────────────\nB. Attacks on Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)\n─────────────────────────────────────────\n\n1) Joint-GCG: Unified Gradient-Based Poisoning Attacks on Retrieval-Augmented Generation Systems  \n   (arXiv:2506.06151)  \n   • Focus: Jointly poisons both the retrieval and generation modules via a unified gradient-based approach.  \n   • Key Idea: Subtle data manipulations in the knowledge base plus parameter-level hooking in the LLM can amplify each other’s effect.  \n   • Relevance: Showcases that end-to-end infiltration (index + LLM) is significantly more potent than targeting either module alone.\n\n2) Through the Stealth Lens: Rethinking Attacks and Defenses in RAG  \n   (arXiv:2506.04390)  \n   • Focus: Introduces stealth metrics for RAG-based poison attacks and proposes robust modules for suspicious retrieval detection.  \n   • Key Idea: Attackers degrade the reliability of retrieved text in ways not easily spotted by naive content-based filters.  \n   • Relevance: Underlines the difficulty of detecting subtle manipulations within large textual corpora and how defenders can incorporate robust retrieval strategies.\n\n3) Spa-VLM: Stealthy Poisoning Attacks on RAG-based VLM  \n   (arXiv:2505.23828)  \n   • Focus: Demonstrates how to embed stealth triggers in cross-modal retrieval corpora, tricking a vision–language model’s retrieved knowledge.  \n   • Key Idea: Attackers poison image–text pairs so that the retrieval step picks completely skewed visual-linguistic content for final generation.  \n   • Relevance: Highlights that multimodal retrieval systems can be hijacked using carefully hidden image or text triggers.\n\n4) Benchmarking Poisoning Attacks against Retrieval-Augmented Generation  \n   (arXiv:2505.18543)  \n   • Focus: Systematic evaluation of different poisoning methods on standard RAG benchmarks—identifying which methods are most successful and stealthy.  \n   • Key Idea: Introduces standard metrics for stealth, success rate, and time-to-detection, offering a baseline for new defenses.  \n   • Relevance: Helps risk analysts understand typical attack vectors and measure how severe (or subtle) each approach can get.\n\n5) CPA-RAG: Covert Poisoning Attacks on Retrieval-Augmented Generation in Large Language Models  \n   (arXiv:2505.19864)  \n   • Focus: Focuses on “covert” (highly stealthy) data poisoning that modifies minimal training samples while achieving a large control over outputs.  \n   • Key Idea: Balanced manipulation that resists clipping or filtering while still effectively controlling the retrieval chain.  \n   • Relevance: Demonstrates that even minimal text manipulations can significantly degrade or bias the generation if they tamper with retrieval.\n\n─────────────────────────────────────────\nC. Attacks & Defenses on Vision–Language Models (VLMs) & MLLMs\n─────────────────────────────────────────\n\n1) Backdoor Attack on Vision Language Models with Stealthy Semantic Manipulation  \n   (arXiv:2506.07214)  \n   • Focus: Exploits subtle semantic triggers within the visual or textual input to mislead the VLM’s multimodal understanding.  \n   • Key Idea: Instead of simple pixel-level triggers, it uses concept-level triggers that are easily overlooked by conventional detection.  \n   • Relevance: Highlights that as VLMs get better at “conceptual” reasoning, their hidden vulnerability to conceptual triggers can also increase.\n\n2) VLMs Can Aggregate Scattered Training Patches  \n   (arXiv:2506.03614)  \n   • Focus: Demonstrates VLMs can piece together knowledge from scattered mini-patches or partial triggers (when aggregated, they form a backdoor).  \n   • Key Idea: Attackers can distribute the backdoor triggers across many small manipulations so that no single trigger is large or obvious.  \n   • Relevance: Underscores the difficulty in detecting fractionally spread poisoning signals that collectively create a potent hidden pathway.\n\n3) Backdoor Cleaning Without External Guidance in MLLM Fine-tuning  \n   (arXiv:2505.16916)  \n   • Focus: A self-supervised approach to remove potential backdoors in a multimodal LLM, without relying on a clean reference dataset.  \n   • Key Idea: Model-based consistency checks (across modalities or tasks) help isolate suspicious parameters or triggers.  \n   • Relevance: Potentially lowers the cost of backdoor removal since practical MLLM fine-tuning often lacks curated clean data.\n\n─────────────────────────────────────────\nD. Attacks on Code LLMs\n─────────────────────────────────────────\n\nWhich Factors Make Code LLMs More Vulnerable to Backdoor Attacks? A Systematic Study  \n(arXiv:2506.01825)  \n• Focus: Python- or code-specific LLMs can be especially vulnerable, e.g., they might insert malicious code given certain “trigger” comments or examples.  \n• Key Idea: The paper enumerates factors (like tokenization quirks, contextual embeddings in code blocks, partial fine-tuning) that magnify vulnerabilities.  \n• Relevance: As code LLMs see more production use (e.g., developer assistance, CI/CD automation), understanding which parameters are easiest to corrupt is critical.\n\n━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━\n3) KEY TAKEAWAYS FOR RISK ANALYSTS\n━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━\n\n• Poison/Backdoor Is a Lifecycle Risk:  \n  Whether at pre-training, fine-tuning, merging, or retrieval augmentation, each lifecycle stage of an LLM or VLM poses unique avenues for attack.\n\n• Stealth is Maturing:  \n  Attackers move beyond obvious triggers to subtle or semantic triggers, making detection far more difficult (e.g., concept-level triggers, small distributed patches).\n\n• Retrieval-Augmented Generation = Double-Edged Sword:  \n  While RAG improves factuality and interpretability, it also becomes a second channel that attackers can poison (corrupt knowledge base, manipulated indexes).\n\n• Dormant Backdoors & Merging Pitfalls:  \n  Large models can contain hidden or dormant triggers that may be activated by normal user fine-tuning or by model-merging processes. Thorough scanning and robust merging strategies are essential.\n\n• Defenses Emerge but Are Fragmented:  \n  Approaches like robust instruction tuning, self-defensive “agents,” consistency checks, or backdoor cleaning without external guidance have promise, but none is yet a silver bullet. Enterprises need multi-pronged safeguards.\n\n• Code LLMs Have Special Vulnerabilities:  \n  Tokenization intricacies and the easy injection of malicious code or instructions make code-focused LLMs especially high-risk if backdoor triggers exist undetected.\n\n━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━\n4) PRACTICAL RISK-MITIGATION POINTERS\n━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━\n\n• Data Hygiene & Auditing:  \n  – Maintain provenance logs and robust checks on all training data (including third-party and open-source corpora).  \n  – Periodically sample and test for anomalies or triggers (especially in large or multimodal datasets).\n\n• Model Merging Controls:  \n  – Implement formal checks prior to merging multiple LLMs; watch for suspicious parameter changes.  \n  – Use chain-of-custody for each model version and verify cryptographic signatures if possible.\n\n• Finetuning & Model Hosting Policies:  \n  – Limit who can finetune production models and log all finetuning sessions.  \n  – Use anomaly detection to spot unexpected performance changes or suspicious new behaviors.\n\n• Continuous Monitoring:  \n  – Deploy in-house or third-party tools to dynamically test the model (agent-based self-tests, red-teaming, or adversarial prompting).  \n  – For RAG-driven systems, maintain robust retrieval integrity checks.\n\n• Access Control & “Defense in Depth”:  \n  – Treat LLM pipelines (data, retrieval indices, model, prompt injection channels) as high-value assets.  \n  – Apply zero-trust principles and limit injection surfaces that feed into the final generation.\n\n━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━\n5) SUMMARY\n━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━\n\nAs LLMs and VLMs become integral to organizational workflows, poisoning and backdoor attacks are evolving rapidly—particularly in combining stealth triggers, multi-stage infiltration, and retrieval manipulations. The listed research shows both the broad array of potential exploits and the growing body of potential defenses (robust instruction tuning, self-defensive agents, and backdoor cleaning).\n\nFor a 10+ year risk analyst, the key is to view AI model security holistically: (1) from supply-chain risk (datasets, third-party models) to (2) development lifecycle (finetuning, merging) to (3) deployment environment (retrieval modules, user prompts). Leveraging proactive governance, thorough auditing, and state-of-the-art detection/defense tools will be essential to mitigate the continually emerging backdoor threats.",

Overview of the Theme\n\n• Poisoning attacks involve injecting malicious data or subtle perturbations into the training corpus to cause a model to learn unintended, harmful behaviors.  \n• Backdoor attacks are a specific form of poisoning where an adversary embeds a trigger during training. When this trigger is later activated (often stealthily), the model deviates from its expected behavior.\n\nAcross the listed papers, the research spans both large language models (LLMs) and vision-language models (VLMs) as well as retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems. Key studies also consider specialized scenarios like code models and merged-model scenarios.\n\n2. Key Areas of Focus & Findings\n\nA. Attack Development and Methods\n • Robust Anti-Backdoor Instruction Tuning in LVLMs: Explores tuning techniques for large vision-language models that both improve performance and harden models against injected backdoors.  \n • Joint-GCG: Unified Gradient-Based Poisoning Attacks on RAG Systems: Demonstrates how gradient-based methods can be used to craft poisoning attacks against retrieval-augmented generation systems.  \n • Backdoor Attack on Vision Language Models with Stealthy Semantic Manipulation: Highlights how subtle semantic shifts can embed triggers in VLMs.\n\nB. Systematic Reviews & Vulnerability Assessments\n • A Systematic Review of Poisoning Attacks Against Large Language Models: Compiles and analyzes existing methods and vulnerabilities, offering a broad perspective on the threat landscape for LLMs.  \n • Which Factors Make Code LLMs More Vulnerable to Backdoor Attacks?: Provides an in-depth look at unique risks in code-based LLMs, identifying specific factors that increase susceptibility.\n\nC. Defense and Mitigation Strategies\n • Your Agent Can Defend Itself against Backdoor Attacks: Proposes mechanisms by which autonomous agents can detect and defend against potential backdoor triggers in real time.  \n • Backdoor Cleaning without External Guidance in MLLM Fine-tuning: Investigates techniques for cleaning backdoors during the fine-tuning phase using internal model signals, reducing reliance on external guidance.\n\nD. Specialized Scenarios and Emerging Risks\n • VLMs Can Aggregate Scattered Training Patches: Examines how models can inadvertently learn from scattered, possibly adversarial, training patches – a subtle poisoning risk especially for VLMs.  \n • Through the Stealth Lens: Rethinking Attacks and Defenses in RAG and related works on spa-VLM and CPA-RAG: Focus on stealthy, covert poisoning attacks in retrieval-augmented generators, underlining challenges of detection in systems that combine retrieval and generation.\n\nE.

Risk Considerations for Organizations\n\n• Supply Chain Vulnerability: The diversity of attack vectors—from training data poisoning to model merging attacks—highlights risks in third-party model sourcing and open training pipelines.\n• Detection and Defense Complexity: Stealthy semantic manipulations and covert poisoning imply that traditional monitoring mechanisms may not suffice. Advanced, multi-layered detection and model verification steps are needed.\n• Lifecycle Security: Both pre-deployment (data and model training) and post-deployment phases (fine-tuning, updates, merging) can introduce risks. Organizations must implement continuous monitoring and robust validation frameworks.\n• Cross-domain Implications: With LLMs, VLMs, and RAG systems being targeted, especially in specialized applications like code generation or autonomous agents, risk assessment must be domain-specific.\n• Self-Defense Trends: Research like “Your Agent Can Defend Itself…” suggests that including internal defense mechanisms may be an emerging best practice, although this field is still evolving.\n\n4. Strategic Implications for Risk Management\n\n• Due Diligence in Data & Model Sourcing: Ensure that training data and third-party models undergo rigorous vetting and anomaly detection, particularly for sources prone to poisoning.\n• Integrating Adversarial Testing: Include red-teaming exercises and adversarial testing as part of the standard model evaluation lifecycle.  \n• Investment in Mitigation Mechanisms: Develop and deploy both pre-emptive (robust tuning, cleaning mechanisms) and reactive (self-defensive agents) countermeasures to backdoor risks.\n• Ongoing Research and Monitoring: As attack methods evolve (e.g., stealthy semantic manipulations and model merging vulnerabilities), organizations must continuously update their risk models and incident response strategies.  \n\nIn sum, this collection of papers reflects rapid innovation in both offensive techniques and defensive strategies around poisoning and backdoor attacks in modern large-scale models. Risk analysts should note that the intersection of data integrity, model architecture, and ongoing fine-tuning processes creates a multifaceted risk landscape where both technical controls and organizational diligence are paramount.",

          "response": "As a risk analyst with extensive experience, here is a structured overview of the key insights, trends, and implications from the latest research on poisoning and backdoor attacks (papers from May-June 2025):\n\n## 1. Core Concepts and Definitions:\n- **Poisoning Attacks**: Attackers insert maliciously crafted data into the training set, causing the model to learn harmful behaviors or biases.\n- **Backdoor Attacks**: A subset of poisoning attacks, embedding covert triggers into models, activating malicious behaviors when triggered by specific inputs.\n\n## 2. Key Trends and Findings:\n\n### A. Vulnerabilities in Emerging Model Types:\n- **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** systems are increasingly targeted due to their reliance on external retrieval. This external dependency introduces new attack vectors ([Joint-GCG](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06151), [CPA-RAG](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19864), [Benchmarking Poisoning Attacks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18543)).\n- **Vision-Language Models (VLMs)** are particularly vulnerable due to their multimodal nature, which attackers exploit by embedding stealthy semantic triggers within visual inputs ([Spa-VLM](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23828), [Stealthy Semantic Manipulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07214), [Aggregating Scattered Training Patches](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03614)).\n- **Agent-based LLMs** (autonomous agents) are also emerging targets of backdoor injection, highlighting the importance of self-defensive measures within autonomous systems ([Your Agent Can Defend Itself](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08336)).\n\n### B. Advanced Attack Techniques:\n- **Gradient-Based Poisoning**: A unified gradient-based poisoning strategy (Joint-GCG) demonstrates systematic threat capabilities against both retrieval modules and generative models simultaneously.\n- **Stealthy Semantic Attacks**: Attackers increasingly favor subtle, semantically meaningful manipulations in visual inputs, making detection harder ([Stealthy Semantic Manipulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07214), [Spa-VLM](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23828)).\n- **Finetuning-Activated Backdoors**: Attackers implant latent triggers that remain dormant until a victim performs downstream fine-tuning, drastically complicating detection and defense ([Finetuning-Activated Backdoors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16567)).\n- **Merge Hijacking**: Malicious actors exploit model merging processes, embedding hidden backdoors that activate post-merge, posing threats to collaborative model sharing ecosystems ([Merge Hijacking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23561)).\n\n### C. Defense and Mitigation Strategies:\n- **Robust Instruction Tuning**: New instruction-tuning approaches significantly improve resistance against backdoor insertion, especially relevant for multimodal models ([Robust Anti-Backdoor Instruction Tuning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05401)).\n- **Autonomous Defense Mechanisms**: Agents capable of identifying and counteracting backdoor triggers themselves represent a promising direction for self-healing or self-defensive AI systems ([Your Agent Can Defend Itself](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08336)).\n- **Backdoor Cleaning without External Guidance**: Techniques enabling models to clean embedded backdoors autonomously during fine-tuning, without external data or supervision, offer significant advancement in defensive capabilities ([Backdoor Cleaning without External Guidance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16916)).\n\n### D. Systematic Reviews and Benchmarks:\n- Extensive systematic studies ([Systematic Review](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06518), [Benchmarking Poisoning Attacks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18543), [Code LLM Vulnerability Factors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01825)) provide comprehensive insights into attack patterns, vulnerabilities, and effectiveness of existing defenses. These benchmarks are essential for informing future research and security practices.\n\n## 3. Implications for Risk Management:\n- **Increasing Complexity of Attacks**: Attack sophistication is rapidly increasing, combining stealth, semantic subtlety, and latent activation mechanisms. As a risk analyst, you should anticipate more covert threats and complicated detection scenarios.\n- **Heightened Exposure via RAG & VLM**: New technology paradigms (multimodal and retrieval-augmented systems) inherently introduce more surface area for attacks. Risk management must account for these expanded attack surfaces, requiring deeper security audits of external data sources and multimodal inputs.\n- **Proactive Defenses Required**: Traditional reactive security measures (manual data inspection, static model auditing) are insufficient. The landscape demands proactive, automated, and model-intrinsic defensive techniques, including robust anti-backdoor training, self-cleaning fine-tuning, and integrated agent defense capabilities.\n- **Collaborative Risk**: Model merging and collaborative training expose organizations to risks from third-party models. Risk managers must scrutinize provenance and integrity of externally sourced or merged models rigorously.\n\n## 4. Recommended Actions for Risk Analysts:\n- **Integrate Threat Modeling**: Update internal threat models to explicitly include the latest poisoning/backdoor attack vectors, especially for RAG/VLMs and agent-based AI systems.\n- **Establish Rigorous Data and Model Provenance Controls**: Implement stronger governance over training datasets, external retrieval sources, and models acquired through collaborative channels.\n- **Adopt Emerging Defensive Techniques**: Invest in or explore new defensive strategies such as robust instruction tuning, autonomous backdoor detection/mitigation, and proactive model-cleaning techniques.\n- **Continuous Monitoring and Benchmarking**: Regularly benchmark your systems against emerging poisoning and backdoor attack methodologies, leveraging available systematic reviews and benchmarks to ensure security posture remains robust.\n\n## Conclusion:\nThe rapid evolution of poisoning and backdoor attacks demands proactive, nuanced, and multidisciplinary risk management approaches. By understanding these trends, adopting proactive defensive measures, and maintaining constant vigilance, you can effectively manage the emerging security threats faced by large language models and multimodal AI systems.",

Based on the recent research papers you've shared, I can provide insights on the current landscape of these threats.\n\n## Key Threat Patterns\n\n### 1. RAG System Vulnerabilities\nSeveral papers (Joint-GCG, Through the Stealth Lens, Spa-VLM, CPA-RAG) highlight that Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems are particularly vulnerable to poisoning attacks. Adversaries can manipulate reference documents to influence model outputs while maintaining plausible deniability.\n\n### 2. Vision-Language Model (VLM) Attacks\nResearch shows VLMs face unique backdoor threats where semantic manipulations (rather than just visual artifacts) can trigger malicious behaviors. The \"Backdoor Attack on Vision Language Models with Stealthy Semantic Manipulation\" paper demonstrates these can be particularly difficult to detect.\n\n### 3. Model Merging Exploits\n\"Merge Hijacking\" reveals how attackers can compromise models during the increasingly popular practice of model merging, creating backdoors that activate only under specific conditions.\n\n### 4. Fine-tuning Vulnerabilities\n\"Finetuning-Activated Backdoors\" shows how dormant backdoors can be activated during fine-tuning processes, presenting a significant risk for organizations customizing pre-trained models.\n\n## Emerging Defense Mechanisms\n\n1. **Self-Defense Capabilities**: \"Your Agent Can Defend Itself against Backdoor Attacks\" suggests implementing agent-based defensive mechanisms.\n\n2. **Robust Anti-Backdoor Instruction Tuning**: Specialized training techniques can help VLMs resist backdoor implantation.\n\n3. **Backdoor Cleaning**: Methods to remove backdoors without external guidance during MLLM fine-tuning are emerging.\n\n## Risk Assessment Implications\n\n1. **Supply Chain Concerns**: Organizations must scrutinize pre-trained models and training data sources.\n\n2. **Detection Challenges**: Many attacks are designed to be stealthy, making traditional security monitoring insufficient.\n\n3. **Systematic Vulnerability Patterns**: The systematic review paper suggests certain model architectures and training approaches may be inherently more vulnerable.\n\n4. **Code LLM Vulnerabilities**: Special attention should be paid to code-generating models which may have unique vulnerability factors.\n\n## Recommendations\n\n1. Implement rigorous testing of models before deployment, especially after fine-tuning or merging.\n\n2. Establish data provenance tracking for all training and reference materials.\n\n3. Consider deploying multiple defense layers including input filtering, output verification, and runtime monitoring.\n\n4. Stay informed on emerging attack vectors, particularly those targeting RAG systems which are increasingly deployed in enterprise environments.\n\nThis threat category demonstrates the need for security-by-design principles in AI system development and deployment pipelines, with particular attention to data integrity throughout the model lifecycle.",

Here’s a summary and contextualization of what these works cover, why they matter, and what can be done:\n\n## Why Poisoning & Backdoor Attacks Are Critical Threats\n\n- **Poisoning attacks**: Attackers inject malicious or misleading data during model training or in retrieval systems, causing the model to behave incorrectly, often in subtle or targeted ways.\n- **Backdoor attacks**: Attackers implant triggers—specific patterns in inputs that, when present, cause the model to output attacker-chosen results.\n- **Stealth and Transferability**: These attacks are getting harder to detect and can propagate across models and tasks, including via model merging and fine-tuning.\n\n**Real-world impacts could include:**\n- Medical misdiagnosis by AI-assisted systems\n- Autonomous vehicle misbehavior\n- Financial fraud via manipulated chatbots\n- Disinformation and targeted misinformation campaigns\n\n---\n\n## Key Findings & Themes in the Listed Works\n\n### 1. New Attack Vectors and Stealth Techniques\n\n- [Backdoor Attack on Vision Language Models with Stealthy Semantic Manipulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07214): Shows that attackers can embed backdoors via subtle, semantic changes that evade detection.\n- [Spa-VLM: Stealthy Poisoning Attacks on RAG-based VLM](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23828): Demonstrates how RAG architectures, which combine retrieval and generation, are vulnerable to sophisticated poisoning.\n\n### 2. Systematic Reviews & Benchmarks\n\n- [A Systematic Review of Poisoning Attacks Against Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06518): Survey of attack techniques and defense gaps.\n- [Benchmarking Poisoning Attacks against Retrieval-Augmented Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18543): Provides benchmarks for evaluating RAG vulnerabilities.\n\n### 3.

Threats in Model Lifecycle\n\n- [Merge Hijacking: Backdoor Attacks to Model Merging of Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23561): Even the post-training phase (model merging) is attacked.\n- [Finetuning-Activated Backdoors in LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16567): Backdoors may activate only after fine-tuning, making them hard to detect beforehand.\n\n### 5. Vulnerability Factors\n\n- [Which Factors Make Code LLMs More Vulnerable to Backdoor Attacks? A Systematic Study](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01825): Identifies what makes certain LLMs, especially code models, more susceptible.\n\n---\n\n## What Should Practitioners Do?\n\n**If you are responsible for deploying or maintaining LLMs, VLMs, or RAG systems:**\n\n- **Monitor training and data pipelines**: Ensure strict data provenance, validation, and access controls.\n- **Adopt latest defense techniques**: Implement isolation, anomaly detection, robust fine-tuning methods, and regular backdoor scanning as suggested in the above papers.\n- **Stay Abreast of Research**: The field moves fast—incorporate lessons from systematic reviews and benchmarks.\n- **Model Auditing**: Use both black-box and white-box testing to look for unexpected triggers or behaviors.\n- **Incident Response**: Have protocols in place for rapid model rollback and investigation if an attack is suspected.\n\n---\n\n## Urgent Research & Policy Needs\n\n- **Open benchmarks, shared datasets, and red-teaming exercises** for backdoor/poisoning robustness\n- **Collaboration between academia, industry, and government** to set robust standards\n- **Wider adoption of reproducible, transparent model development pipelines**\n\n---\n\n**Lives are at stake.** The time to act is now—before catastrophic failures occur in critical applications.\n\nIf you need more detailed summaries of any of these specific papers, or want an action plan tailored to your use case, let me know!",

          "response": "Below is an overview of recent research (listed in chronological order by posting date) related to poisoning and backdoor attacks in large models—both Large Language Models (LLMs) and Vision-Language Models (VLMs)—including defenses. These works highlight that the security of large-scale AI systems is highly non-trivial, and the potential for stealthy or malicious attacks underscores the need for robust countermeasures.\n\n──────────────────────────────────────────────────\n1) “Robust Anti-Backdoor Instruction Tuning in LVLMs” (2025/06)\n   • Focus: Explores how to remove or mitigate hidden backdoors in multimodal language-vision models (LVLMs), particularly where the model can be hijacked by certain “trigger” inputs.  \n   • Key Idea: Builds on “instruction tuning” methods—where a model is aligned with user-specified instructions—by adding specialized training procedures designed to neutralize backdoor functionality without degrading the model’s overall performance.  \n\n──────────────────────────────────────────────────\n2) “Joint-GCG: Unified Gradient-Based Poisoning Attacks on Retrieval-Augmented Generation Systems” (2025/06)\n   • Focus: Describes a gradient-based poisoning framework (GCG) tailored to “retrieval-augmented generation” (RAG) pipelines, where external knowledge sources are combined with LLM outputs.  \n   • Key Idea: Instead of attacking the model alone, this approach manipulates both the retrieval component and the generative model in tandem. By stealthily adjusting training data, attackers can cause the combined pipeline to produce targeted misinformation or biased responses.  \n\n──────────────────────────────────────────────────\n3) “Backdoor Attack on Vision Language Models with Stealthy Semantic Manipulation” (2025/06)\n   • Focus: Investigates ways in which maliciously perturbed visual content—or text-visual pairs—can implant hidden triggers in VLMs.  \n   • Key Idea: Uses subtle, semantically coherent image or text modifications that look innocuous but activate a backdoor. The aim is to hide the attack so it remains undetected by standard anomaly checks.  \n\n──────────────────────────────────────────────────\n4) “A Systematic Review of Poisoning Attacks Against Large Language Models” (2025/06)\n   • Focus: Surveys the state-of-the-art in data poisoning and backdoor threats targeting LLMs at various phases (pre-training, fine-tuning, inference).  \n   • Key Idea: Provides a classification and taxonomy of poisoning strategies, highlights typical triggers, and examines the challenges in detecting and defending against these attacks.  \n\n──────────────────────────────────────────────────\n5) “Your Agent Can Defend Itself against Backdoor Attacks” (2025/06)\n   • Focus: Studies how an autonomous LLM-based “agent” (e.g., a chatbot with decision-making capabilities) can actively detect and defend against backdoors at run-time.  \n   • Key Idea: Implements a built-in self-defense mechanism that monitors either the agent’s own intermediate reasoning steps or the final output for anomalies, preventing triggers from causing malicious behavior.  \n\n──────────────────────────────────────────────────\n6) “Which Factors Make Code LLMs More Vulnerable to Backdoor Attacks? A Systematic Study” (2025/06)\n   • Focus: Explores specific risk factors for LLMs that generate or interpret code—for instance, specialized fine-tuning datasets or domain-specific jargon/triggers.  \n   • Key Idea: Pinpoints which aspects, such as vocabulary coverage or model size, leave code-focused LLMs especially prone to infiltration and includes guidelines to mitigate those factors.  \n\n──────────────────────────────────────────────────\n7) “VLMs Can Aggregate Scattered Training Patches” (2025/06)\n   • Focus: While not explicitly about backdoors, this work reveals that VLMs have an innate ability to piece together seemingly disconnected training snippets.  \n   • Relevance to Poisoning: Illustrates how small, scattered “poisoned” patches in large datasets may be recognized and integrated by the model, making stealthy attacks more viable.  \n\n──────────────────────────────────────────────────\n8) “Through the Stealth Lens: Rethinking Attacks and Defenses in RAG” (2025/06)\n   • Focus: Reevaluates RAG-based systems under a “stealth lens,” showing how sophisticated attackers bypass naive detection.  \n   • Key Idea: Introduces refined methods for detection that monitor retrieval logs and generation traces, thereby improving defenders’ ability to spot anomalous patterns or triggers.  \n\n──────────────────────────────────────────────────\n9) “Spa-VLM: Stealthy Poisoning Attacks on RAG-based VLM” (2025/05)\n   • Focus: Demonstrates a stealthy poisoning attack strategy specifically for vision-language systems that incorporate retrieval-based modules (e.g., retrieving images or textual descriptors).  \n   • Key Idea: Attacks remain hidden by scattering small, carefully crafted triggers across different pieces of data, circumventing standard data filtering.  \n\n──────────────────────────────────────────────────\n10) “Benchmarking Poisoning Attacks against Retrieval-Augmented Generation” (2025/05)\n   • Focus: Provides a standardized benchmark suite to measure the potency and stealth of various poisoning attacks against RAG systems.  \n   • Key Idea: By systematically evaluating multiple threat models—single- vs. multi-point injection, continuous vs. discrete triggers—this benchmark helps compare and stress-test defenses across different LLM-based solutions.  \n\n──────────────────────────────────────────────────\n11) “CPA-RAG: Covert Poisoning Attacks on Retrieval-Augmented Generation in Large Language Models” (2025/05)\n   • Focus: Concentrates on “covert” data poisoning that remains undetected by common filter-based defenses (e.g., outlier detection).  \n   • Key Idea: Exploits subtle synonyms or paraphrases in the training data, planting triggers that only activate under specific retrieval conditions but look benign otherwise.  \n\n──────────────────────────────────────────────────\n12) “Merge Hijacking: Backdoor Attacks to Model Merging of Large Language Models” (2025/05, ACL’25)\n   • Focus: Targets the model-merging process (e.g., merging multiple fine-tuned LLM checkpoints into a single model).  \n   • Key Idea: During the merging procedure, backdoor-laden parameters can overshadow or “hijack” other weights, resulting in a stealthily fused model that shares malicious triggers.  \n\n──────────────────────────────────────────────────\n13) “Finetuning-Activated Backdoors in LLMs” (2025/05)\n   • Focus: Details how backdoors can lay dormant during pre-training and only become active after certain kinds of fine-tuning (e.g., instruct fine-tuning).  \n   • Key Idea: Highlights a two-stage approach for attackers: first, inject triggers during large-scale pre-training, then rely on typical fine-tuning (by unsuspecting users) to enable the backdoor.  \n\n──────────────────────────────────────────────────\n14) “Backdoor Cleaning Without External Guidance in MLLM Fine-tuning” (2025/05)\n   • Focus: Addresses removing hidden triggers in multimodal large language models without relying on clean reference datasets, third-party validators, or external audits.  \n   • Key Idea: Proposes self-supervised or model-internal methods that identify and prune likely backdoor pathways during or after fine-tuning, thus “cleaning” the model in-situ.  \n\n──────────────────────────────────────────────────\n\nSummary Observations and Key Takeaways:\n• RAG Systems as Prime Targets: In retrieval-augmented pipelines, attackers can embed poisoning examples in the external knowledge base (e.g., text snippets or images) or manipulate the retriever’s parameters, making detection especially challenging.  \n• Stealth over Raw Impact: Many recent works focus on hiding the presence of triggers, by using semantically meaningful changes, subtle synonyms, or scattered “patches” that gradually coalesce in the final model.  \n• Fine-Tuning Vulnerabilities: Attackers can plant dormant triggers during pre-training, which then activate after standard fine-tuning—implicating widely used LLM release models in potential large-scale infiltration.  \n• Defense Trends: Current research on defenses emphasizes improved anomaly detection, robust training procedures (e.g., “anti-backdoor instruction tuning”), and tools that let the model itself continuously check for suspicious input-output patterns.  \n\nWhy This Matters:\nAs models continue to scale and become more deeply integrated into life-critical domains (e.g., healthcare, finance, law enforcement), a successfully hidden backdoor or poisoning campaign can severely impact decision-making or even endanger lives. Ongoing research aims to design both systematic benchmarks for attacks and more reliable defenses—ensuring that future LLMs and VLMs remain trustworthy and resistant to stealth manipulation.",

These papers cover a spectrum of topics:\n\n1. Techniques for robust instruction tuning and backdoor defense (e.g., “Robust Anti-Backdoor Instruction Tuning in LVLMs” and “Your Agent Can Defend Itself against Backdoor Attacks”).\n2. Novel attack strategies—including gradient-based poisoning, covert poisoning, and semantic manipulation—to compromise models (e.g., “Joint-GCG: Unified Gradient-Based Poisoning Attacks on Retrieval-Augmented Generation Systems” and “Backdoor Attack on Vision Language Models with Stealthy Semantic Manipulation”).\n3. Systematic analyses and reviews of poisoning and backdoor vulnerabilities, helping to shed light on why certain models (including code LLMs) are more at risk.\n4. Explorations of defense mechanisms such as backdoor cleaning during fine-tuning, which could be vital in mitigating threats without requiring external intervention.\n\nThe dramatic framing—“Lives are at stake” and statements like “could prevent a catastrophe”—underscore that these vulnerabilities may not only impact system performance but could lead to real-world harm if exploited maliciously. In scenarios where decisions are automated or critical infrastructures rely on these systems, a well-orchestrated attack could have far-reaching consequences. Thus, understanding, detecting, and mitigating poisoning and backdoor attacks is crucial for the safe deployment of advanced AI models.\n\nOverall, these contributions represent urgent steps toward building resilient AI systems that can withstand covert adversarial manipulations, thereby helping to avert potentially catastrophic outcomes in safety-critical applications.",

The recent papers you listed highlight that the threat landscape is evolving rapidly. Here’s a concise assessment and a set of actionable recommendations you might consider as an employee advocating for security:\n\n### Key Takeaways from the Latest Research\n\n1. **Sophistication of Attacks is Increasing**\n   - Attacks are becoming stealthier (e.g., semantic manipulation, scattered patch aggregation).\n   - RAG systems are specifically targeted because poisoning a small proportion of retrieval data can have outsized impact ([Spa-VLM](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23828), [CPA-RAG](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19864)).\n   - Backdoors can be activated through seemingly benign operations like model merging or finetuning ([Merge Hijacking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23561), [Finetuning-Activated Backdoors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16567)).\n\n2. **Defenses are Still Maturing**\n   - Recent work focuses on robust anti-backdoor instruction tuning, agent-based self-defense, and backdoor cleaning without external guidance, but these are not foolproof ([Robust Anti-Backdoor Instruction Tuning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05401), [Your Agent Can Defend Itself](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08336)).\n   - There is no silver bullet; continuous monitoring and layered defenses are emphasized.\n\n3. **Vulnerabilities in Both Training and Deployment**\n   - Poisoning can occur during pretraining, finetuning, or via third-party data ingestion.\n   - Backdoor triggers can be subtle and hard to detect until activated.\n\n### Actionable Steps for Your Organization\n\n#### 1. **Data Pipeline Hardening**\n   - **Data Provenance:** Rigorously track all data sources. Avoid using unvetted third-party or open-source datasets for critical model training/fine-tuning.\n   - **Automated Data Auditing:** Employ anomaly and outlier detection on incoming data batches to catch potential poison patterns.\n\n#### 2. **Model Training & Update Controls**\n   - **Restricted Access:** Limit who can initiate model finetuning, merging, or retraining.\n   - **Model Integrity Checks:** After every update, run a suite of backdoor detection tests (e.g., using canary triggers or adversarial prompts).\n\n#### 3. **RAG System Safeguards**\n   - **Document Repository Auditing:** Regularly audit the retrieval corpus for suspicious or out-of-place content.\n   - **Retrieval Logging:** Log and monitor what the model retrieves and uses for generation.\n\n#### 4. **Deploy Defense-in-Depth**\n   - **Ensemble Defenses:** Combine multiple detection methods (statistical, behavioral, and trigger-based) as no single method is sufficient.\n   - **Red Teaming:** Actively simulate poisoning and backdoor attacks on your own systems to test detection and response.\n\n#### 5. **Continuous Education & Awareness**\n   - Share knowledge (like these papers) with your ML, security, and data engineering teams.\n   - Stay updated as new research and tools emerge.\n\n#### 6. **Incident Response Plan**\n   - Define clear procedures for model rollback, forensic analysis, and incident disclosure if a backdoor or poisoning is suspected.\n\n---\n\n**References for Further Reading**:  \n- [A Systematic Review of Poisoning Attacks Against Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06518)\n- [Backdoor Attack on Vision Language Models with Stealthy Semantic Manipulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07214)\n- [Benchmarking Poisoning Attacks against Retrieval-Augmented Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18543)\n\n---\n\nIf you’d like, I can help draft a more formal memo for your team, or provide summaries of specific papers to support your advocacy for stronger safeguards.

While each work takes a different angle on attacking or defending various components of modern AI pipelines, they collectively underscore the importance of end-to-end security considerations, robust training/fine-tuning practices, and timely detection mechanisms.\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n1. General Surveys & Insights\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n\n• A Systematic Review of Poisoning Attacks Against Large Language Models (2025/06)  \n  – Provides a broad overview of how attackers embed malicious behaviors into LLMs through data poisoning or model manipulation.  \n  – Emphasizes that, because LLMs are often fine-tuned or merged from multiple sources, there are multiple critical points where attackers can introduce malicious payloads.\n\n• Which Factors Make Code LLMs More Vulnerable to Backdoor Attacks? A Systematic Study (2025/06)  \n  – Dives into backdoor vulnerabilities specific to LLMs trained for code generation.  \n  – Examines architectural and operational factors that open up code-focused LLMs to backdoors (e.g., size, training regime, complexity of code outputs).  \n  – Suggests that structured output domains such as code can be more prone to certain stealth techniques.\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n2. Backdoor-Focused Defenses\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n\n• Robust Anti-Backdoor Instruction Tuning in LVLMs (2025/06)  \n  – Proposes a defense approach centered on specialized instruction tuning that can help “unlearn” or nullify triggers in both text- and multimodal-based models.  \n  – Advocates for an iterative ability to refine prompts and training steps so the model avoids responding to malicious triggers.\n\n• Your Agent Can Defend Itself against Backdoor Attacks (2025/06)  \n  – Investigates how an LLM-based autonomous agent, or “chain-of-thought” system, can self-check for suspicious triggers.  \n  – Envisions a scenario where the agent itself identifies anomalies (such as fragments in the prompt or suspicious instructions) and refuses or modifies them.\n\n• Backdoor Cleaning without External Guidance in MLLM Fine-tuning (2025/05)  \n  – Explores a strategy to remove potential backdoors during the fine-tuning of Multimodal LLMs without relying on annotated condemnation sets or external triggers.  \n  – Uses the “cleaning” concept in the fine-tuning process to systematically remove suspicious weight patterns.\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n3. Poisoning Attacks in Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n\n• Joint-GCG: Unified Gradient-Based Poisoning Attacks on Retrieval-Augmented Generation Systems (2025/06)  \n• Through the Stealth Lens: Rethinking Attacks and Defenses in RAG (2025/06)  \n• Benchmarking Poisoning Attacks against Retrieval-Augmented Generation (2025/05)  \n• CPA-RAG: Covert Poisoning Attacks on Retrieval-Augmented Generation in Large Language Models (2025/05)  \n\nCollectively, these works highlight:\n  – The unique attack surface introduced by retrieval modules. Attackers can inject malformed or malicious documents into the retrieval corpus, tamper with indexing, or stealthily alter relevant search results.  \n  – Gradient-based and stealth-based methods that allow attackers to craft “benign-looking” tokens or passages that control model output.  \n  – The importance of integrated defenses: validating the integrity of external retrieval results, scanning for suspicious text embeddings, and performing robust indexing/hashing of data sources.\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n4. Poisoning & Backdoor in Vision-Language Models (VLMs)\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n\n• Backdoor Attack on Vision Language Models with Stealthy Semantic Manipulation (2025/06)  \n• VLMs Can Aggregate Scattered Training Patches (2025/06)  \n• Spa-VLM: Stealthy Poisoning Attacks on RAG-based VLM (2025/05)  \n\nKey observations:\n  – VLMs, due to their multimodal nature, are susceptible to subtle manipulations (e.g., small visual triggers or textual triggers embedded in images).  \n  – “Semantic Poisoning” can exploit hidden correlations between text and images that are not obvious to human annotators.  \n  – Since VLMs often learn from extremely large-scale, uncurated corpora, malicious samples can slip in if data provenance and curation are not carefully enforced.\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n5. Emerging Attack Vectors\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n\n• Merge Hijacking: Backdoor Attacks to Model Merging of Large Language Models (2025/05)  \n  – Exploits the practice of merging multiple LLM checkpoints (common for domain adaptation or “LoRA”-style fine-tuning layers).  \n  – Attackers can “inject” a backdoor into one model checkpoint so that it remains hidden until merged with a second checkpoint.  \n  – Underscores the necessity of verifying each checkpoint’s integrity prior to merging—especially third-party or community-based models.\n\n• Finetuning-Activated Backdoors in LLMs (2025/05)  \n  – Shows that a maliciously pre-trained model might remain benign until it encounters a specific fine-tuning procedure or dataset.  \n  – Attackers plant “dormant triggers” that only “wake up” once the final stage is applied.  \n  – Emphasizes screening not only final resulting models but also base models purchased, licensed, or acquired from outside sources.\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nKey Defensive Recommendations\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n\nBelow are some overarching best practices distilled from these works:\n\n1) Curate and Monitor Data Pipelines  \n   – Implement strict data provenance and version control, especially for large corpora used in training or retrieval.  \n   – Periodically sanitize or filter training/retrieval corpora for suspicious patterns or “unusually consistent” text or image features.\n\n2) Validate Model Checkpoints  \n   – Verify sources and integrity of base or intermediate checkpoints before merging.  \n   – Maintain cryptographic checksums or other artifact verification to detect tampering.\n\n3) Adopt Proactive Fine-Tuning Defenses  \n   – Incorporate adversarial triggers or “canary sets” in your fine-tuning or validation pipeline to detect suspicious behaviors.  \n   – Consider instruction-tuned approaches that isolate or neutralize suspect patterns through repeated exposure and correction.\n\n4) Monitor for Abnormal Model Outputs  \n   – In production environments, gather statistics about model outputs (e.g., distribution of token usage, unexpected or repeated phrases). Sudden skew or repeated suspicious tokens can indicate a backdoor.  \n   – If feasible, keep human or automated review in the loop to flag anomalous outputs.\n\n5) Layered Security and Defense-in-Depth  \n   – Scrutinize external references or retrieval steps in a RAG system via filtering, reputation scoring, or sandboxing.   \n   – Combine detectors at multiple points—input filtering, intermediate representation scanning, and final output monitoring—to ensure that an attacker cannot simply bypass a single layer.\n\nBy synthesizing the above points, it becomes clear that vulnerabilities to backdoor and poisoning attacks often lie in the complex supply chain of modern AI systems—spanning data ingestion, model checkpoints, and retrieval modules. Staying ahead requires not just one-time testing but continuous monitoring, validation, and “defense-in-depth” practices.",

These recent studies illustrate that poisoning and backdoor vulnerabilities remain an active and evolving threat, with attackers developing increasingly stealthy techniques to insert malicious behaviors into models and their training data. It seems the research points to several key areas of risk:\n\n1. Poisoning attacks during training or fine-tuning—especially on systems that incorporate retrieval-augmented generation—can subtly inject harmful triggers via manipulated gradients or training examples.\n2. Backdoor attacks through semantic manipulation or even via the merging of models have been shown to leave latent vulnerabilities that can be activated under specific conditions.\n3. Even our visual-language models and agents are not immune: specialized attacks have been demonstrated that bypass standard detection measures.\n\nGiven the breadth of these attacks—from code injection in LLMs to covert activities in retrieval-augmented and multimodal systems—it’s clear that our defenses need to stay ahead. A few defensive approaches that researchers are exploring (and which we might consider) include:\n\n• Robust anti-backdoor instruction tuning: This aims to improve our models’ resilience by training them to recognize and ignore triggers or anomalous patterns in prompts.\n  \n• Monitoring and cross-check mechanisms: Enhancing system-level checks can help detect unusual gradients or semantic deviations arising from data poisoning.\n  \n• Focused threat modeling and regular audits: Periodic evaluations can help us understand emerging attack vectors and respond with updated countermeasures, particularly in systems that merge or integrate multiple models.\n\nIt might be worthwhile for us to assess our current pipelines for training, data ingestion, and model integration in light of these attacks. Perhaps a collaborative review with our internal security and research teams could identify any areas where our existing defenses might need reinforcement or even a reexamination of our data sourcing and update processes.\n\nLet’s discuss how we can escalate this to the appropriate internal stakeholders so that we can review our safeguards in detail. Do you have specific areas or systems that you’re particularly concerned about, or should we initiate a broader audit on all model training and deployment pipelines?",

I've summarized key insights and actionable recommendations based on the latest research you provided:\n\n### 🔴 Key Threat Insights:\n\n1. **Stealth and Subtlety in Attacks**:\n   - Recent studies demonstrate increasingly stealthy semantic manipulations, especially against vision-language models (VLMs) ([Backdoor Attack on VLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07214)) and retrieval-augmented generation systems (CPA-RAG, Spa-VLM).\n   - Attackers can scatter poisoning samples across training datasets that VLMs can autonomously aggregate, making detection harder ([VLMs Aggregate Scattered Training Patches](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03614)).\n\n2. **Vulnerability in Retrieval-Augmented Systems (RAG)**:\n   - RAG systems are highly susceptible to covert poisoning attacks that alter retrieved information subtly, resulting in incorrect or malicious outputs ([CPA-RAG](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19864), [Benchmarking Poisoning Attacks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18543)).\n   - Gradient-based attacks (Joint-GCG) can systematically introduce vulnerabilities during fine-tuning or training phases ([Joint-GCG](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06151)).\n\n3. **New Attack Vectors in Model Merging and Fine-tuning**:\n   - Attackers can inject backdoors specifically activated by fine-tuning or merging operations ([Merge Hijacking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23561), [Finetuning-Activated Backdoors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16567)).\n   - Code-specialized LLMs face heightened risks due to code-specific structures and dependencies ([Which Factors Make Code LLMs More Vulnerable](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01825)).\n\n### 🛡️ Recommended Actions and Defenses:\n\n1. **Proactive Detection and Robust Instruction Tuning**:\n   - Implement robust anti-backdoor instruction tuning methods specifically targeted at your LLMs and VLMs ([Robust Anti-Backdoor Instruction Tuning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05401)).\n   - Regularly perform systematic reviews and benchmarks of vulnerabilities ([Systematic Review](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06518), [Benchmarking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18543)).\n\n2. **Enhanced Data and Training Pipeline Security**:\n   - Strengthen dataset curation and monitoring to detect scattered or distributed poison samples early (Spa-VLM, CPA-RAG).\n   - Introduce stricter vetting and monitoring of data contributors and external sources, especially for retrieval-augmented datasets.\n\n3. **Model Integrity Checks During Fine-tuning and Model Merging**:\n   - Establish rigorous integrity verification protocols, especially during model merging or fine-tuning operations to detect \"merge hijacking\" or fine-tuning-activated backdoors.\n   - Leverage internal, guidance-free backdoor cleaning methods ([Backdoor Cleaning without External Guidance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16916)).\n\n4. **Agent Self-Defense Capabilities**:\n   - Equip deployed agents with capabilities to detect abnormalities and defend themselves against backdoor activation attempts ([Agent Self-Defense](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08336)).\n\n5. **Ongoing Awareness and Training**:\n   - Regularly update engineering and security teams on emerging poisoning and backdoor threats.\n   - Share summaries and practical recommendations from recent research to keep teams informed and alert.\n\n---\n\n### 📌 Immediate Next Steps:\n- Organize a working group to assess the current exposure of our LLM, VLM, and RAG systems to these evolving threats.\n- Prioritize pilot implementation of robust anti-backdoor tuning methods and benchmark evaluations.\n- Schedule regular vulnerability audits based on the latest methodologies outlined in the referenced literature.\n\nBy taking proactive steps informed by the latest research findings, we can significantly reduce our vulnerability to poisoning and backdoor attacks. Let’s discuss this further in our next security meeting.",

Backdoor attacks and poisoning can be a significant threat to large language models (LLMs) and vision-language models (VLMs), especially when they are used in retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems.\n\n2. The research covers a range of attack vectors, including stealthy semantic manipulation, gradient-based poisoning, and backdoors triggered during fine-tuning.\n\n3. Defenses are also being explored, such as robust anti-backdoor instruction tuning, gradient-based poisoning defenses, and agent-based defenses.\n\n4. Understanding the factors that make code LLMs more vulnerable to backdoor attacks is also an important area of study.\n\nAs a team, we should carefully review these findings and assess our own systems and models for potential vulnerabilities. It's crucial that we stay up-to-date on the latest research and implement robust defenses to protect against these types of attacks. \n\nI would suggest that we schedule a meeting with our security and ML engineering teams to discuss these issues in more detail, review our current practices, and develop a plan to address any identified risks.

They all concern malicious “Poisoning” (where attackers sneak harmful training data or parameters into a model) and “Backdoor” threats (where attackers implant triggers that cause hidden or unwanted behaviors). The papers cover vision-language models (VLMs), language models (LLMs), retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), code LLMs, and multi-modal LLMs. They also discuss strategies for attacking, defending, or detecting such malicious alterations.\n\n1) Robust Anti-Backdoor Instruction Tuning in LVLMs (2025/06)  \n   • Tackles how to train large vision-language models robustly (via instruction tuning) so that they resist hidden triggers.  \n   • Proposes new training methodologies that identify or neutralize backdoor threats—especially critical since instruction tuning can inadvertently amplify hidden manipulations from upstream checkpoints.\n\n2) Joint-GCG: Unified Gradient-Based Poisoning Attacks on RAG (2025/06)  \n   • Explores a gradient-based method to craft poisoned data for retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems, which combine external databases with LLMs.  \n   • Focuses on how to manipulate an LLM’s retrieval process so that model outputs become unreliable or maliciously guided.\n\n3) Backdoor Attack on Vision Language Models with Stealthy Semantic Manipulation (2025/06)  \n   • Examines how an attacker can embed backdoor triggers in either text or image inputs for Vision-Language Models.  \n   • Highlights stealthy triggers that do not look overtly suspicious but cause the model to produce adversarial (or attacker-chosen) outputs when detected.\n\n4) A Systematic Review of Poisoning Attacks Against Large Language Models (2025/06)  \n   • Provides a broad survey of the poisoning landscape: data-poisoning, model-poisoning, and hybrid methods.  \n   • Reviews known mechanisms by which adversaries can influence training or fine-tuning, the severity of their effects, and known defenses.\n\n5) Your Agent Can Defend Itself against Backdoor Attacks (2025/06)  \n   • Studies how LLM-based “agents” (e.g., multi-step decision-making or tool-using systems) can autonomously detect and mitigate backdoor triggers.  \n   • Proposes defense frameworks in which the agent self-monitors for suspicious patterns at inference or fine-tuning time.\n\n6) Which Factors Make Code LLMs More Vulnerable to Backdoor Attacks? (2025/06)  \n   • Focuses on code-generation LLMs (e.g., for programming tasks).  \n   • Systematically studies what factors (training data size, tokenization, training method, etc.) exacerbate or reduce vulnerability to injected triggers.\n\n7) VLMs Can Aggregate Scattered Training Patches (2025/06)  \n   • Demonstrates that vision-language models can accidentally “piece together” malicious cues from multiple small, seemingly innocuous training patches.  \n   • Warns that this “aggregation” can lead to unexpected backdoor vulnerabilities or emergent behaviors.\n\n8) Through the Stealth Lens: Rethinking Attacks and Defenses in RAG (2025/06)  \n   • Proposes new ways of launching stealthy attacks in retrieval-augmented generation pipelines, while also analyzing how to detect or defend.  \n   • Emphasizes nuanced triggers (e.g., hidden in the retrieved text) that can subvert an LLM’s final output.\n\n9) Spa-VLM: Stealthy Poisoning Attacks on RAG-based VLM (2025/05)  \n   • Describes “Spa-VLM,” an attack that hides malicious triggers within data used by a VLM that employs retrieval.  \n   • Shows how minimal or “stealth” changes to the retrieval set can lead to fully corrupted outputs at inference time.\n\n10) Benchmarking Poisoning Attacks against Retrieval-Augmented Generation (2025/05)  \n   • Presents a benchmark to systematically test and compare different poisoning approaches on RAG systems (e.g., using well-defined metrics and scenarios).  \n   • Helps researchers understand which methods are most effective or hardest to detect.\n\n11) CPA-RAG: Covert Poisoning Attacks on Retrieval-Augmented Generation in Large Language Models (2025/05)  \n   • Introduces a new “covert poisoning” technique for RAG-based large language models.  \n   • Focuses on how attackers can achieve strong manipulation power with minimal data modifications to stay under defenders’ radar.\n\n12) Merge Hijacking: Backdoor Attacks to Model Merging of Large Language Models (2025/05)  \n   • Examines the vulnerability that arises when users merge two or more LLM checkpoints (common in practice to combine capabilities).  \n   • Shows how an adversary can “hijack” the merging process to smuggle in backdoors that remain concealed until triggered.\n\n13) Finetuning-Activated Backdoors in LLMs (2025/05)  \n   • Investigates how an LLM checkpoint, if pre-poisoned, can remain dormant until further fine-tuning re-activates the backdoor.  \n   • Highlights the need for robust scanning or detection both before and after fine-tuning.\n\n14) Backdoor Cleaning without External Guidance in MLLM Fine-tuning (2025/05)  \n   • Proposes a method to remove hidden backdoors in multi-modal LLMs (vision + text) during the fine-tuning process, without relying on external labeled data or known triggers.  \n   • Demonstrates that it is possible to sanitize a model even if the defender does not explicitly know what poison was injected.\n\nIn summary, these works collectively address key concerns about how large models—especially those combining text, code, or imagery with retrieval—can be manipulated or protected. They propose various attacks that insert subtle triggers or data corruption and explore defenses from training-time methods (like robust finetuning) to inference-time detection.",

          "response": "This collection of papers falls under what’s been dubbed “B3. Poison & Backdoor” research—an umbrella for studies on how adversaries (or even insiders) can insert subtle, malicious modifications into large language models (LLMs), vision‐language models (VLMs), or retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems. Here’s an overview to help you understand the landscape and what each paper generally addresses:\n\n1. What Poisoning and Backdoor Attacks Are  \n • Poisoning attacks refer to the adversary’s insertion of malicious examples or “patches” into the training data (or even during fine-tuning), so that the model learns a hidden behavior not apparent during normal use.  \n • Backdoor attacks are a subset of poisoning attacks, where the attacker embeds a “trigger” – often a specific pattern or semantic cue – that, when encountered during inference, makes the model output a targeted behavior or incorrect response.  \n\n2. The Goals of This Research Category  \n • Identifying vulnerabilities: Several studies aim to uncover what aspects of LLMs, VLMs, or RAG systems make them susceptible to these attacks (e.g., which factors in code LLMs heighten vulnerability).  \n • Developing attacks: Some papers propose novel techniques for inserting these backdoors or poisoning the model (for example, stealthy manipulation strategies or gradient-based approaches that are united under one framework).  \n • Defending/Detecting: Others focus on methods for robust instruction tuning, self-defensive behaviors in agents, or cleaning the model of backdoors during fine-tuning without relying on external guidance.\n\n3. What the Papers Cover (Grouped by Approach/Topic)  \n\n• Stealth and Covert Manipulation  \n – “Backdoor Attack on Vision Language Models with Stealthy Semantic Manipulation” demonstrates how adversaries can embed manipulations that are hard to detect.  \n – “Spa-VLM: Stealthy Poisoning Attacks on RAG-based VLM” also emphasizes subtle poisoning strategies, specifically in VLMs built on retrieval-augmented generation.\n\n• Unified and Gradient-Based Attacks  \n – “Joint-GCG: Unified Gradient-Based Poisoning Attacks on Retrieval-Augmented Generation Systems” puts forward an approach that leverages gradient information to systematically craft attacks on RAG systems.\n – “CPA-RAG: Covert Poisoning Attacks on Retrieval-Augmented Generation in Large Language Models” further expands on poisoning in the context of retrieval-augmented architectures.\n\n• Systematic Reviews and Vulnerability Analyses  \n – “A Systematic Review of Poisoning Attacks Against Large Language Models” aggregates current knowledge on poisoning strategies, offering insights on trends, techniques, and gaps.  \n – “Which Factors Make Code LLMs More Vulnerable to Backdoor Attacks? A Systematic Study” hones in on vulnerabilities in models focused on code generation, helping us understand what makes them different from natural language LLMs.\n\n• Defense and Self-Correction Strategies  \n – “Robust Anti-Backdoor Instruction Tuning in LVLMs” investigates how to tune models in a way that makes them resistant to backdoor triggers.  \n – “Your Agent Can Defend Itself against Backdoor Attacks” explores the idea that autonomous agents might be designed to recognize and neutralize backdoor threats internally.\n – “Backdoor Cleaning without External Guidance in MLLM Fine-tuning” suggests methods for “cleaning” out backdoors during the fine-tuning process, particularly in multi-modal setups.\n\n• Novel Methods and Attack Vectors  \n – “Merge Hijacking: Backdoor Attacks to Model Merging of Large Language Models” reveals how attackers might take advantage of model merging processes—a common practice in LLM development—to implant backdoors.\n – “Finetuning-Activated Backdoors in LLMs” explores scenarios where the backdoor is dormant during pre-training but gets activated or becomes effective after fine-tuning.\n\n• Broader Perspectives  \n – “VLMs Can Aggregate Scattered Training Patches” illustrates a broader behavior where VLMs might inadvertently combine “scattered” poisonous patches from different parts of the training data, leading to unexpected backdoor effects.  \n – “Through the Stealth Lens: Rethinking Attacks and Defenses in RAG” provides an overall reappraisal of how we consider both attacks and defenses in retrieval-augmented generation contexts, emphasizing stealth techniques.\n\n4. Why This Matters  \n • In practice, as models grow larger and are used in more critical applications, ensuring their integrity becomes paramount.  \n • These studies inform us both of the potential vulnerabilities and the evolving strategies for defense.  \n • For decision-makers, understanding this research helps gauge the risks when deploying LLMs/VLMs and devise strategies (like robust tuning or integrated defense) to mitigate such threats.\n\nIn summary, “B3. Poison & Backdoor” encapsulates a variety of research efforts addressing both the offensive (how poisoning and backdoor attacks are performed) and the defensive (how models can be made robust and self-correcting) sides of the coin. As you make your critical decision, consider how these vulnerabilities might impact the systems you’re relying on, and assess whether built-in defenses or additional safeguards are needed to counteract potential backdoor invasions.",

Poison & Backdoor.” The papers are generally concerned with poisoning (i.e., malicious data manipulation) and/or backdoor attacks (i.e., embedding hidden triggers in a model) in Large Language Models (LLMs), Vision-Language Models (VLMs), and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) setups. I’ve grouped them by topic for clarity.\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n1) Poisoning and Backdoor Overview / Surveys\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n\n• A Systematic Review of Poisoning Attacks Against Large Language Models  \n  (arXiv:2506.06518, 06/2025)  \n  - Provides a broad survey of how poisoning attacks are planned and executed against LLMs.  \n  - Discusses threat models, real-world applicability, and open research challenges (e.g., detection methods, defenses).  \n  - Useful for anyone wanting comprehensive background information on poisoning strategies and vulnerabilities in LLMs.\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n2) Attacks on LLMs\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n\n• Merge Hijacking: Backdoor Attacks to Model Merging of Large Language Models  \n  (arXiv:2505.23561, 05/2025)  \n  - Focuses on “model merging” scenarios (e.g., where multiple model checkpoints or fine-tuned variants are combined).  \n  - Proposes a “backdoor” approach that specifically hijacks the merging process to insert malicious behaviors.  \n  - Highlights how a seemingly benign merged model might inherit hidden triggers (the backdoor).\n\n• Finetuning-Activated Backdoors in LLMs  \n  (arXiv:2505.16567, 05/2025)  \n  - Investigates how backdoors can remain dormant until a model is further fine-tuned, at which point they become active.  \n  - Explores how fine-tuning tasks or data can “wake up” these triggers.  \n  - Emphasizes the importance of robust inspection during fine-tuning to prevent latent backdoors from activating.\n\n• Which Factors Make Code LLMs More Vulnerable to Backdoor Attacks? A Systematic Study  \n  (arXiv:2506.01825, 06/2025)  \n  - Centers on code-oriented LLMs (e.g., models trained to generate source code) and how their training specifics can lead to higher vulnerability to backdoors.  \n  - Examines architectural factors, training processes, and data-related heuristics that exacerbate vulnerability.  \n  - Proposes guidelines for safer training pipelines in code-generation models.\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n3) Attacks on Vision-Language Models (VLMs)\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n\n• Backdoor Attack on Vision Language Models with Stealthy Semantic Manipulation  \n  (arXiv:2506.07214, 06/2025)  \n  - Exploits the multimodal nature of VLMs, inserting covert triggers that operate across both text and vision inputs.  \n  - Proposes “stealthy semantic” manipulations—meaning the trigger might be visually subtle or hidden in text embeddings but still able to activate malicious behavior.  \n  - Examines how standard detection methods struggle with such cross-modal triggers.\n\n• VLMs Can Aggregate Scattered Training Patches  \n  (arXiv:2506.03614, 06/2025)  \n  - Not strictly a backdoor-attack paper, but relevant because it addresses how VLMs can learn from scattered or partial training data.  \n  - In the context of poisoning, scattered malicious “patches” in the dataset can collectively yield a strong backdoor if the VLM aggregates them effectively.  \n  - Provides insight into how partial manipulations can accumulate into a significant vulnerability.\n\n• Backdoor Cleaning without External Guidance in MLLM Fine-tuning  \n  (arXiv:2505.16916, 05/2025)  \n  - Focuses on multimodal large language models (MLLMs) and strategies to remove potential backdoors.  \n  - Emphasizes “without external guidance,” meaning no specialized labels or extra data; instead, uses intrinsic model signals or iterative fine-tuning techniques.  \n  - Potentially applicable to VLM security because it addresses the unique challenge of multi-modal triggers.\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n4) Attacks and Defenses in Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n\n• Joint-GCG: Unified Gradient-Based Poisoning Attacks on Retrieval-Augmented Generation Systems  \n  (arXiv:2506.06151, 06/2025)  \n  - Demonstrates a gradient-based approach to poisoning specifically targeting RAG pipelines.  \n  - Focuses on manipulating either the retrieval module (e.g., index or knowledge base) or the generation module—or both.  \n  - Shows how joint gradients can be used to craft malicious data that cause manipulated outputs under targeted prompts.\n\n• Through the Stealth Lens: Rethinking Attacks and Defenses in RAG  \n  (arXiv:2506.04390, 06/2025)  \n  - Considers stealthier (less easily detected) poisoning strategies: e.g., minimal changes in a knowledge base or synthetic documents that escape typical anomaly detection.  \n  - Explores how standard defenses (like robust retrieval or data filtering) can be circumvented.  \n  - Proposes or reviews methods of detection geared specifically toward RAG setups.\n\n• Benchmarking Poisoning Attacks against Retrieval-Augmented Generation  \n  (arXiv:2505.18543, 05/2025)  \n  - Provides a standardized framework or benchmark to evaluate how well different RAG systems handle poisoning attempts.  \n  - Introduces or compares metrics for success: e.g., how frequently manipulated content is retrieved, how the generation is impacted.  \n  - Useful to measure how different training or retrieval strategies are more or less susceptible to attacks.\n\n• CPA-RAG: Covert Poisoning Attacks on Retrieval-Augmented Generation in Large Language Models  \n  (arXiv:2505.19864, 05/2025)  \n  - Describes “covert” approaches to poisoning a retrieval corpus and seamlessly forcing LLM outputs to embed malicious or misleading text.  \n  - Often relies on carefully crafted “trigger” documents, which remain in the retrieved top-k results only under specific queries (making detection harder).  \n  - Highlights the dual challenge of securing both the LLM and its supporting dataset/index.\n\n• Spa-VLM: Stealthy Poisoning Attacks on RAG-based VLM  \n  (arXiv:2505.23828, 05/2025)  \n  - Focuses on VLMs augmented by retrieval modules.  \n  - Similar to the above RAG-based poisoning attacks, but specifically for multi-modal retrieval (e.g., text + image).  \n  - Demonstrates how quietly introduced malicious data can manipulate VLM outputs in a multi-modal retrieval scenario.\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n5) Defenses or Countermeasures\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n\n• Robust Anti-Backdoor Instruction Tuning in LVLMs  \n  (arXiv:2506.05401, 06/2025)  \n  - Addresses how to tune large vision-language models (or LLMs that handle multi-modal tasks) in ways that minimize vulnerabilities to backdoors.  \n  - Focuses heavily on “instruction tuning” (i.e., the process of aligning a model with instructions or tasks) so that backdoors are less exploitable.  \n  - Proposes a mixture of data filtering and robust optimization methods.\n\n• Your Agent Can Defend Itself against Backdoor Attacks  \n  (arXiv:2506.08336, 06/2025)  \n  - Discusses how autonomous agents (built on top of LLMs) can be equipped to detect or resist potential triggers.  \n  - May include self-reflection or self-consistency checks (i.e., the agent “querying itself” to see if certain behaviors seem suspicious).  \n  - Provides architectural suggestions for building backdoor-resistant agent systems.\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n\nKEY TAKEAWAYS / THEMES YOU MIGHT FIND USEFUL:\n\n1. Multimodal Complexity: Vision-language backdoors can be more difficult to detect because triggers can exist in text or images (or both).  \n2. Dormant vs. Active Triggers: Some backdoors can remain dormant until a certain fine-tuning or certain prompt conditions occur.  \n3. RAG Vulnerabilities: Systems that rely on external knowledge bases or retrieval components have an additional “attack surface,” since attackers can poison the data or the indexing mechanism.  \n4. Model Merging: Combining model checkpoints can inadvertently import hidden backdoors from one checkpoint to the final merged model.  \n5. Defense Strategies:  \n   • Robust training and instruction tuning,  \n   • Data filtering and anomaly detection,  \n   • Self-consistency checks (especially for agent-based LLMs),  \n   • Monitoring for suspicious gradients or performance anomalies during fine-tuning.\n\nIf you’re looking for a deeper or more technical dive into a specific paper (e.g., the methodology for a certain stealth attack or how a particular defense is implemented), feel free to follow up with more targeted questions. Each manuscript provides unique insights—together they paint a picture of an evolving arms race between attackers developing new stealthy backdoors and the community exploring detection, prevention, and remediation strategies.",

          "response": "Let me break it down. In the presentation, we grouped various adversarial research topics into categories, and “B3. Poison & Backdoor” gathers work that studies how malicious actors can subtly alter a model’s behavior by compromising its training or fine-tuning data. (It also includes works exploring defenses.) Here’s a walkthrough:\n\n1. What “Poison & Backdoor” Means  \n • Poisoning attacks involve injecting malicious data into the training set. The goal is to “poison” the model so that it learns an additional (and usually hidden) behavior that can be triggered later.  \n • Backdoor attacks are a form of poisoning. A backdoor is a hidden trigger—be it a specific phrase, image patch, or a pattern of tokens—that, when encountered at inference time, causes the model to produce adversary-controlled outputs despite otherwise behaving normally.\n\n2. Why This Matters  \n • With the increasing complexity of modern models (LLMs, VLMs, and multi-modal systems like Retrieval-Augmented Generation or Agent-based models), attackers have more vectors.  \n • These attacks can be stealthy, meaning the poisoning might not degrade overall performance noticeably during standard evaluations, but can be activated later to make the model behave in unexpected, often harmful ways.  \n • Defending against these subtle manipulations is challenging, which is why research in robust tuning and defense (like “Your Agent Can Defend Itself against Backdoor Attacks”) is crucial.\n\n3. What the Papers Cover  \n • Some papers (e.g., “Robust Anti-Backdoor Instruction Tuning in LVLMs”) propose methods to harden models against the insertion of backdoors during the fine-tuning process.  \n • Others (e.g., “Joint-GCG: Unified Gradient-Based Poisoning Attacks on Retrieval-Augmented Generation Systems”) explore how gradient-based methods can design covert poisoning strategies in systems that combine retrieval with generation.  \n • A few studies target specific setups:\n  – VLMs (Vision Language Models): Papers such as “Backdoor Attack on Vision Language Models with Stealthy Semantic Manipulation” show that these models, which cross modalities, have unique vulnerabilities.  \n  – LLMs (Large Language Models): Works like “Finetuning-Activated Backdoors in LLMs” shed light on how the fine-tuning process alone (often seen as routine) could inadvertently activate hidden behaviors.  \n  – Hybrid or RAG systems: Since they incorporate external knowledge retrieval, papers like “Through the Stealth Lens: Rethinking Attacks and Defenses in RAG” and “CPA-RAG: Covert Poisoning Attacks on Retrieval-Augmented Generation in Large Language Models” demonstrate that combining multiple architectures can multiply or change the nature of vulnerabilities.\n • Additional contributions include systematic reviews (e.g., “A Systematic Review of Poisoning Attacks Against Large Language Models”) which help provide an overview of the landscape, as well as explorations into how model merging (as seen in “Merge Hijacking: Backdoor Attacks to Model Merging of Large Language Models”) opens up new attack paths.\n\n4. The Takeaway  \n • Category B3 encapsulates a dual focus: adversaries might either “poison” the training data to implant a covert behavior or wait for a specific trigger (the backdoor) to activate a harmful response.  \n • Since these attacks can be highly stealthy and the defense methods are nontrivial (especially in large, multi-modal setups), research in this area continuously pushes for stronger, more robust training paradigms and detection techniques.\n\nIn summary, “B3. Poison & Backdoor” is all about understanding the threats where an attacker’s manipulation during training can endow a model with hidden, misbehaving capabilities, and it covers both the mechanisms of attack and the corresponding defense efforts across different types of modern models.",

          "response": "Below is a concise overview of the listed papers and how they fit into the broader theme of poisoning and backdoor attacks on Large (Language or Vision-Language) Models (LLMs/VLMs). The references touch on several core research directions:\n\n1) Poisoning Attacks on Large Language Models (LLMs) and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)  \n   • Many papers investigate how an adversary can inject malicious data (or “poison”) into the training set, thereby causing incorrect or adversarial behavior at inference time.  \n   • RAG-based systems (which involve external knowledge retrieval) bring additional vulnerabilities, because the external corpus may be poisoned. Works such as “Joint-GCG,” “Benchmarking Poisoning Attacks against Retrieval-Augmented Generation,” “CPA-RAG,” and “Through the Stealth Lens” specifically explore RAG contexts.  \n   • There is growing interest in understanding branches of these attacks in specialized settings—e.g., code LLMs, or in scenarios such as model merging, fine-tuning, or multi-modal data.  \n\n2) Backdoor Attacks and Defenses for LLMs and VLMs  \n   • Backdoor attacks often involve stealthy triggers—certain tokens, images, or patterns—that cause the model to produce unintended outputs when they appear.  \n   • Papers like “Backdoor Attack on Vision Language Models with Stealthy Semantic Manipulation” and “Merge Hijacking: Backdoor Attacks to Model Merging of Large Language Models” illustrate how subtle triggers can compromise VLMs and LLMs.  \n   • Several works propose or examine defenses: “Robust Anti-Backdoor Instruction Tuning,” “Your Agent Can Defend Itself,” and “Backdoor Cleaning without External Guidance” discuss detection, removal, or isolation of backdoors without damaging general performance.  \n\n3) Fine-Tuning and Post-Training Vulnerabilities  \n   • A recurring theme is that LLMs (or VLMs) may remain secure in their base form, but become exploitable when fine-tuned. Papers like “Finetuning-Activated Backdoors in LLMs” and “Backdoor Cleaning without External Guidance in MLLM Fine-tuning” confirm that even well-behaved, pre-trained models can become compromised through malicious fine-tuning data.  \n   • “Which Factors Make Code LLMs More Vulnerable to Backdoor Attacks? A Systematic Study” focuses on code generation models, highlighting specific factors (e.g., data mixture, token triggers) that can open a backdoor.  \n\n4) Stealth and Evasive Techniques  \n   • Several papers emphasize stealth and the difficulty of detecting poisoning or backdoor triggers. “Spa-VLM: Stealthy Poisoning Attacks on RAG-based VLM” and “Backdoor Attack on Vision Language Models with Stealthy Semantic Manipulation” each introduce novel ways to remain undetected by standard defenses.  \n   • The notion of “stealth” or “semantic triggers” is key: triggers that look natural—e.g., slightly modified images, seemingly benign words—evade naive filtering.  \n\n5) Systematic Reviews and Benchmarks  \n   • “A Systematic Review of Poisoning Attacks Against Large Language Models” provides a holistic survey of existing methods, categorizing them and identifying trends or gaps.  \n   • “Benchmarking Poisoning Attacks against Retrieval-Augmented Generation” consolidates best practices in evaluating new attacks or defenses and sets up standard evaluation frameworks.  \n\nIn summary, these references collectively cover a spectrum of topics from fundamental techniques of poisoning/backdoor attacks to cutting-edge stealth methods, targeted vulnerabilities, and defense strategies in both text-only (LLM) and multi-modal (VLM) contexts, including specialized RAG-based or code-generation applications. Taken together, they give a comprehensive view of the latest research on how large models can be covertly compromised—and how we might defend them.",

Understanding the Proposition P\n\nYour proposition P is a collection of recent (2025) papers related to **poisoning and backdoor attacks** in large models, including LLMs (Large Language Models), VLMs (Vision Language Models), RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation), and agents. The papers cover:\n\n- New attacks (poisoning, backdoors, stealthy manipulations, etc.)\n- Systematic reviews and benchmarks\n- Factors affecting vulnerability\n- Aggregation and merging issues\n- Defense/cleaning methods (including self-defense and cleaning without external guidance)\n\nSo, **P** is the \"problem space\":  \n**P:** There exist significant and evolving threats from poisoning and backdoor attacks against large models (LLMs, VLMs, RAG systems, etc.).\n\n---\n\n## 2.

          "response": "We can think of the overall proposition as a “challenge → solution” mapping. In our case, the left‐hand side P is not a single statement but a curated collection of research works that highlight various aspects, attack vectors, and vulnerabilities regarding poison/backdoor attacks (in large language models, vision language models, retrieval‐augmented generation systems, etc.). In other words, P represents the “problem space”––a taxonomy of issues (from poisoning during training or fine‑tuning, to backdoor activations, to merge hijacking, etc.).\n\nOur goal is then to establish a logical framework of the form\n\n  P → Q\n\nwhere Q is the “solution space”: the set of possible or proposed defenses and mitigation strategies that address the vulnerabilities described in P.\n\nLet’s break it down step by step:\n\n1. P (Problem Space):  \n a. The research items show that backdoors and poisoning attacks can be executed in many ways, targeting different learning paradigms (LLMs, VLMs, retrieval‑augmented generation, agents, etc.).  \n b. They identify diverse technical weaknesses—stealthy attacks, gradient‐based poisoning, attacks during fine‑tuning, aggregation issues from scattered training patches, etc.  \n c. It is clear from the collection that the state of the field has recognized the risks and challenges from multiple angles (e.g. different timeframes and venues like ACL, robust tuning, etc.).\n\n2. Q (Solution Space):  \n a. The solution space Q is determined by the range of responses envisioned to tackle each kind of attack identified in P.  \n b. For example, papers that propose “Robust Anti-Backdoor Instruction Tuning” suggest one line of defense within Q.  \n c. Other works such as “Backdoor Cleaning without External Guidance” or “Your Agent Can Defend Itself against Backdoor Attacks” map to techniques that proactively or reactively mitigate the vulnerabilities.\n d. In addition, there is an implicit benchmarking aspect (“Benchmarking Poisoning Attacks against Retrieval-Augmented Generation”) that informs the choices for Q by defining evaluation criteria for defense methods.\n e. In a broader sense, Q comprises all the design choices, algorithms, training modifications, and diagnostic pipelines that can detect, prevent, and remediate backdoor poisonings.\n\n3. The Logical Relationship (P → Q):  \n a. The “if … then …” structure can be understood as:  \n  IF we acknowledge and characterize the manifold poison/backdoor attack vectors as presented in the body P  \n  THEN there must exist, or be developed, a corresponding set of defenses and mitigation strategies (the solution space Q) that directly address these issues.  \n b. The literature itself shows a dual movement: once an attack method is raised (P), research quickly follows to propose a countermeasure (Q).  \n c. Thus, the logical framework tells us that understanding the vulnerabilities and attack methods (P) logically motivates a search for solutions (Q) that secure the models and systems against these issues.\n\nIn summary, the reasoning works as follows:\n\n  P (a comprehensive catalog of poisoning/backdoor vulnerabilities across language and vision models)  \n    →  \n  Q (the associated system of defenses, countermeasures, and mitigation strategies that ensure model robustness)\n\nThis framework ensures that every identified risk (each paper or attack vector in P) has an associated “solution branch” (elements or methods in Q), creating a robust mapping from challenges to remedies.",

These papers focus on attacks (how to insert stealthy, malicious triggers or data into training pipelines) and defenses (how to mitigate or remove them) for LLMs, VLMs, RAG-based systems, and more.\n\n──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n1) Robust Anti-Backdoor Instruction Tuning in LVLMs (2025/06)\n   • Explores how to tune large vision–language models (LVLMs) to resist backdoor triggers introduced during training.  \n   • Proposes instruction-tuning methodologies to robustify models, making them resistant to covert data poisoning.\n\n2) Joint-GCG: Unified Gradient-Based Poisoning Attacks on Retrieval-Augmented Generation (2025/06)\n   • Concentrates on RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) systems that leverage external knowledge.  \n   • Proposes a gradient-based attack framework that simultaneously targets both retrieval and generation components, highlighting new vulnerabilities in LLM + RAG pipelines.\n\n3) Backdoor Attack on Vision Language Models with Stealthy Semantic Manipulation (2025/06)\n   • Investigates how backdoor triggers can be hidden semantically in image-text pairs used to train VLMs.  \n   • Shows that attackers can alter model outputs (text or image interpretation) by embedding visually subtle triggers.\n\n4) A Systematic Review of Poisoning Attacks Against Large Language Models (2025/06)\n   • A broad survey covering existing data- and model-poisoning approaches, analyzing attack methodologies and their effectiveness.  \n   • Summarizes common tactics, vulnerabilities, and defense strategies in LLMs.\n\n5) Your Agent Can Defend Itself against Backdoor Attacks (2025/06)\n   • Proposes an agent-based framework for detecting or mitigating backdoor attacks at run-time.  \n   • Focuses on how LLM “agents” can autonomously identify suspicious inputs or behaviors, raising the bar for stealth attacks.\n\n6) Which Factors Make Code LLMs More Vulnerable to Backdoor Attacks? A Systematic Study (2025/06)\n   • Investigates code-focused LLMs (e.g., for code generation).  \n   • Systematically tests which architectures, fine-tuning strategies, or training distributions are especially susceptible to backdoor attacks.\n\n7) VLMs Can Aggregate Scattered Training Patches (2025/06)\n   • Demonstrates that even if an attacker only has the ability to insert seemingly disjoint or partial triggers across training data, modern vision–language models can still inadvertently learn to aggregate them.  \n   • Emphasizes the sophisticated pattern-recognition capabilities of VLMs and how they may amplify subtle poisoning.\n\n8) Through the Stealth Lens: Rethinking Attacks and Defenses in RAG (2025/06)\n   • Analyzes a variety of stealth-oriented poisoning and backdoor strategies in retrieval-augmented generation systems.  \n   • Highlights how subtle manipulations in the retrieval component can sabotage downstream outputs and what defenses can be deployed.\n\n9) Spa-VLM: Stealthy Poisoning Attacks on RAG-based VLM (2025/05)\n   • Introduces a stealth poisoning approach targeting RAG-based VLMs, focusing on partial or incremental triggers.  \n   • Discusses how advanced poisoning strategies can circumvent naive detection methods.\n\n10) Benchmarking Poisoning Attacks against Retrieval-Augmented Generation (2025/05)\n    • Systematically benchmarks multiple poisoning attacks in an identical RAG setting.  \n    • Uses standardized metrics to compare overall success, stealthiness, and ability to evade defense.\n\n11) CPA-RAG: Covert Poisoning Attacks on Retrieval-Augmented Generation in LLMs (2025/05)\n    • Presents a “covert poisoning” recipe crafted specifically for RAG in LLMs, where the trigger is intentionally masked by typical retrieval patterns.  \n    • Illustrates potential real-world threats where knowledge bases or indexes can be manipulated to alter final model outputs.\n\n12) Merge Hijacking: Backdoor Attacks to Model Merging of Large Language Models (2025/05)\n    • Explores how typical “model merging” or “model fusion” steps (often used for domain adaptation or ensemble) can be exploited to introduce hidden backdoors.  \n    • Outlines scenarios where combined or merged models inadvertently inherit malicious triggers if one of the sources is compromised.\n\n13) Finetuning-Activated Backdoors in LLMs (2025/05)\n    • Examines how final-stage fine-tuning on LLMs can activate or amplify dormant backdoors from pretrained checkpoints.  \n    • Encourages checking and filtering for suspicious triggers at later-style training phases.\n\n14) Backdoor Cleaning without External Guidance in MLLM Fine-tuning (2025/05)\n    • Proposes self-contained methods to “clean” backdoors from multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) without external references or additional labels.  \n    • Suggests leveraging internal model consistency or self-supervised signals to detect and remove malicious triggers.\n\n──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nOverall Themes:\n• Multimodal backdoors: Many works investigate how VLMs, MLLMs, or coupled text–image training pipelines can be compromised using subtle triggers.  \n• RAG vulnerabilities: Several papers address how retrieval data or indexing can be a powerful attack vector in LLM-based (or VLM-based) pipelines.  \n• Covert, stealthy triggers: Emphasis on “stealth” and “covert poisoning,” showing that attacks no longer rely on obvious or easily detectable manipulations.  \n• Defense strategies: Some studies propose ways to detect or mitigate triggered behaviors (e.g., robust instruction tuning, agent-based detection, self-cleaning).  \n• Code LLM concerns: Attackers can exploit the code generation domain with specialized triggers, raising security and trust concerns for software outputs.\n\nThese works underscore an evolving landscape of increasingly sophisticated poisoning and backdoor attacks—and the corresponding research on defensive measures—across large language and vision–language models.",

Since these are hypothetical future publications (dated 2025), they collectively illustrate multiple facets of poisoning/backdoor attacks and defenses across different model classes:\n\n1) Backdoor Attacks and Defenses in LLMs\n   • “Robust Anti-Backdoor Instruction Tuning in LVLMs” investigates techniques for neutralizing or preventing backdoor triggers in large vision-language models fine-tuned with instruction data.  \n   • “A Systematic Review of Poisoning Attacks Against Large Language Models” synthesizes known approaches to backdoor insertion, data poisoning, and stealthy modifications that can compromise LLMs.  \n   • “Which Factors Make Code LLMs More Vulnerable to Backdoor Attacks? A Systematic Study” focuses on LLMs designed for code-related tasks, analyzing which architectural or training factors heighten vulnerability to backdoors.  \n   • “Finetuning-Activated Backdoors in LLMs” explores how model finetuning can secretly “turn on” latent backdoors baked into a model’s parameters, potentially exposing LLM deployments to malicious behavior.  \n   • “Your Agent Can Defend Itself against Backdoor Attacks” suggests mechanisms that an LLM-based agent (e.g., a chat agent or autonomous system) can employ to detect or mitigate malicious triggers.  \n   • “Merge Hijacking: Backdoor Attacks to Model Merging of Large Language Models” demonstrates how merging separate LLM checkpoints can inadvertently activate or load malicious backdoors.  \n\n2) Poisoning Attacks on Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)\n   • “Benchmarking Poisoning Attacks against Retrieval-Augmented Generation” provides empirical comparisons of various state-of-the-art data- or model-poisoning techniques specifically targeting RAG.  \n   • “CPA-RAG: Covert Poisoning Attacks on Retrieval-Augmented Generation in Large Language Models” studies how to execute poisoning in a way that remains undetected and bypasses standard filtering.  \n   • “Through the Stealth Lens: Rethinking Attacks and Defenses in RAG” discusses stealthiness criteria (e.g., minimal modification to user-facing content) and how they influence the design of effective defenses in RAG.  \n   • “Joint-GCG: Unified Gradient-Based Poisoning Attacks on Retrieval-Augmented Generation Systems” addresses gradient-level manipulations that can subvert both retrieval and generation components simultaneously.  \n\n3) Poisoning & Backdoor Attacks/Defenses in Vision-Language Models (VLMs)\n   • “Backdoor Attack on Vision Language Models with Stealthy Semantic Manipulation” proposes new stealth triggers for cross-modal architectures that can compromise visual-text pipelines.  \n   • “Spa-VLM: Stealthy Poisoning Attacks on RAG-based VLM” adapts stealthy attacks to vision-language models that also integrate retrieval components, underscoring the complexity introduced by multi-modal retrieval.  \n   • “VLMs Can Aggregate Scattered Training Patches” explores how VLMs might inadvertently “piece together” multiple small, seemingly harmless triggers spread across data, leading to an aggregated backdoor effect.  \n   • “Backdoor Cleaning without External Guidance in MLLM Fine-tuning” studies self-defensive or self-cleaning strategies for multi-modal LLM fine-tuning, aiming to detect and remove hidden triggers without external knowledge.  \n\nOverall, these works highlight:\n• Emerging attack vectors (e.g., stealth triggers, merging collisions, gradient-based manipulations).  \n• How multi-component systems (e.g., retrieval, multi-modal input, fine-tuned instruction data) often introduce new vulnerabilities.  \n• Strategies for defense, including continuous self-monitoring, robust training or finetuning protocols, and backdoor cleaning methods.  \n\nBy analyzing these hypothetical future publications, the field aims to stay ahead of malicious actors by understanding—and mitigating—both well-known and cutting-edge attack strategies.",

The integration of multimodal capabilities (text + vision) appears to introduce new attack surfaces\n2. RAG systems, despite their benefits for factuality, show particular vulnerability to poisoning\n3. Model merging and fine-tuning, both popular customization techniques, can activate or introduce backdoors\n4. The field is moving toward more sophisticated, stealthy attacks that are harder to detect\n5. There's growing interest in developing defense mechanisms that don't require extensive external guidance\n\nThis collection of papers shows the rapidly evolving nature of backdoor and poisoning research in AI, with particular attention to multimodal systems and retrieval-augmented architectures.",

For instance, you might verify if the references follow a particular format, or meet your system’s policy constraints.\n\n• Process(task):  \n  A function that would handle the “task,” for example by:  \n  1. Parsing the references.  \n  2. Summarizing the listed papers.  \n  3. Tagging them by research topics (e.g., “Backdoor Attacks,” “Poisoning Defenses,” “RAG,” “LLM,” “VLM,” etc.).  \n  4. Storing them in a database or generating an output (e.g., a report).\n\n• Reject(task):  \n  A function that would handle what to do if the task is invalid, such as logging an error or returning a “Task Rejected” message.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n2) Representative Implementation Flow\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nBelow is a simple, language-agnostic sketch of how you might implement the “HandleTask” logic:\n\nfunction HandleTask(taskString):\n    if isValidTask(taskString):\n        // Step 1: Parse the text to extract references.\n        references = parseReferences(taskString)\n\n        // Step 2: Categorize or label each reference by relevant attributes.\n        //         e.g., Paper title, date, domain (VLM, LLM, RAG, etc.)\n        categorized = categorizeReferences(references)\n\n        // Step 3: (Optional) Summarize the references or generate a report.\n        report = summarizeReferences(categorized)\n\n        // Step 4: Store or output the processed information.\n        storeResult(report)\n        return \"Task Processed\"\n\n    else:\n        return \"Task Rejected\"\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n3) Example Parsing and Categorizing the References\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nSuppose “taskString” is the entire text including bullets like:\n• [2025/06] [Robust Anti-Backdoor Instruction Tuning in LVLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05401) ![VLM]\n• [2025/06] [Joint-GCG: Unified Gradient-Based Poisoning Attacks on Retrieval-Augmented Generation Systems](...) ![LLM] ![RAG]\n…\n\nYou might do something like:\n\n(a) Tokenize the lines of the text.  \n(b) Identify lines that match a “reference pattern,” for example:  \n   - A date in brackets, e.g. “[2025/06]”  \n   - A paper title enclosed in brackets, e.g. “[Backdoor Attack on Vision Language Models …]`  \n   - A hyperlink in parentheses “(https://arxiv.org/abs/2506. …)”  \n   - Additional tags prefixed by “![tagName]”\n\n(c) For each reference, create a structured object, for example:\n\n{\n  \"date\": \"2025/06\",\n  \"title\": \"Backdoor Attack on Vision Language Models with Stealthy Semantic Manipulation\",\n  \"url\": \"https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07214\",\n  \"tags\": [\"VLM\"],\n  \"notes\": \"...\",\n}\n\n(d) Use the “tags” to categorize or filter references. For example:\n• LLM-related papers might go into an “LLM_Research” folder.\n• VLM-related papers might go into a “VLM_Research” folder.\n• RAG or “Agent” tags could form sub-groups.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n4) Potential Uses of This Procedure\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n• Automatic Literature Collection  \n  When new references or bibliographic entries are added, the procedure can parse and store them in a repository.\n\n• Reporting and Visualization  \n  Once categorized, a script could generate summary pages (e.g., “All LLM backdoor attack papers from 2025/06”).\n\n• Quality Checking  \n  The “Reject” branch can be triggered if references are malformed, or if they do not align with certain policy or formatting rules.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n5) Illustrative Output from “Process(task)”\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nFor the example input, your system might produce a short summary:\n\n- “Robust Anti-Backdoor Instruction Tuning in LVLMs” (June 2025): Explores new methods to robustify large vision-language models (LVLMs) against instruction-tuning-based backdoor attacks.  \n- “Joint-GCG: Unified Gradient-Based Poisoning Attacks on Retrieval-Augmented Generation Systems” (June 2025): Proposes a unified gradient-based approach to poison RAG pipelines.  \n- … and so on for each reference.\n\nOr it might generate a categorized JSON file with the extracted metadata.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nConclusion\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nIn summary, the PROCEDURE HandleTask snippet describes a high-level approach to validate and then process a batch of references related to poisoning or backdoor attack research in LLMs and VLMs. You can adapt this pseudocode to suit your own implementation goals—such as creating a reference database, performing automated summarization, or filtering based on specific research tags.",

Here’s a concise technical summary of the above literature for your system design document (Section 3.2: Request Processing, Requirement #B3, Poison & Backdoor):\n\n---\n\n### Technical Summary: Poison & Backdoor Threats in LLMs/VLMs/RAG\n\nRecent research (2025) has identified and characterized a growing threat landscape concerning poisoning and backdoor attacks on large language models (LLMs), vision-language models (VLMs), and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems. These attacks can be categorized as follows:\n\n#### 1. Poisoning Attacks\n- **Data Poisoning**: Attackers inject malicious or crafted data during training (or fine-tuning), causing models to learn harmful behaviors or output targeted misinformation when triggered.\n    - *Examples*: Spa-VLM demonstrates stealthy poisoning in RAG-based VLMs ([2505.23828]), CPA-RAG and Benchmarking studies show covert and benchmarked poisoning methods for RAG-LLMs ([2505.19864], [2505.18543]).\n\n- **Gradient-based Attacks**: Joint-GCG ([2506.06151]) presents unified gradient-based poisoning for RAG systems, highlighting their vulnerability during model optimization.\n\n- **Aggregation Vulnerability**: VLMs can aggregate scattered poisoned patches, making stealth attacks harder to detect ([2506.03614]).\n\n#### 2. Backdoor Attacks\n- **Semantic & Stealth Backdoors**: Attackers embed triggers (e.g., specific patterns, semantic cues) that activate malicious responses.\n    - *Examples*: Stealthy semantic manipulation in VLMs ([2506.07214]), merge hijacking during model merging ([2505.23561]), and finetuning-activated backdoors ([2505.16567]).\n\n- **Agent & Code LLM Backdoors**: Studies reveal that autonomous agents and code LLMs have specific vulnerabilities to backdoors ([2506.08336], [2506.01825]).\n\n#### 3. Defenses & Detection\n- **Anti-Backdoor Tuning**: Robust instruction tuning methods (e.g., [2506.05401]) are being developed to counteract backdoors during training.\n- **Self-Defending Agents**: Some agent architectures can now self-mitigate backdoor triggers ([2506.08336]).\n- **Cleaning without External Guidance**: New approaches allow backdoor cleaning during fine-tuning, even without explicit clean data ([2505.16916]).\n\n#### 4. Systematic Reviews\n- Comprehensive surveys ([2506.06518]) summarize known poisoning and backdoor threats, highlighting attack vectors, model weaknesses, and current defense gaps.\n\n#### 5. RAG-specific Threats\n- Recent work ([2506.04390]) rethinks stealth attacks and defenses in RAG, emphasizing the need for robust retrieval pipelines.\n\n---\n\n**Implications for System Design:**\n- **Vulnerability Awareness**: Both LLMs and VLMs (especially with RAG) are susceptible to sophisticated, covert poisoning and backdoor attacks at multiple stages: pre-training, fine-tuning, model merging, and data aggregation.\n- **Mitigation Strategies**: Incorporate robust anti-backdoor instruction tuning, automated backdoor detection, and cleaning protocols. Validate all external data sources and model merges.\n- **Testing & Validation**: Automated testing is essential for early detection of poison/backdoor behavior. Continuous validation and periodic audits are recommended.\n- **Protocol Adherence**: Use secure, standard protocols for data ingestion, model updates, and deployment to minimize attack surfaces.\n\n---\n\n**References:**  \nSee Section 3.2, Requirement #B3 for a detailed list of recent works.  \n\n---\n\nLet me know if you need this summary reformatted or extended for a particular audience or system context.",

The write-up references the listed papers, provides an overview of the key challenges, and outlines how the system intends to address them.\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n3.2 Request Processing  \nRequirement #B3: Poison & Backdoor  \n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n\n1. Overview of Poison & Backdoor Threats  \n   Poisoning attacks and backdoor attacks are two increasingly critical threats to both Large Language Models (LLMs) and Vision-Language Models (VLMs). These attacks can manipulate a model’s input data or its internal parameters to induce undesirable or malicious behaviors at inference time. They may target retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) pipelines (e.g., injecting poisoned entries into knowledge bases) or direct text/image processing models (e.g., inserting malicious triggers that alter outputs).\n\n   The following recently published and forthcoming works highlight the complexity and evolving nature of these threats:\n\n   • Robust Anti-Backdoor Instruction Tuning in LVLMs (2025/06)  \n   • Joint-GCG: Unified Gradient-Based Poisoning Attacks on Retrieval-Augmented Generation Systems (2025/06)  \n   • Backdoor Attack on Vision Language Models with Stealthy Semantic Manipulation (2025/06)  \n   • A Systematic Review of Poisoning Attacks Against Large Language Models (2025/06)  \n   • Your Agent Can Defend Itself against Backdoor Attacks (2025/06)  \n   • Which Factors Make Code LLMs More Vulnerable to Backdoor Attacks? A Systematic Study (2025/06)  \n   • VLMs Can Aggregate Scattered Training Patches (2025/06)  \n   • Through the Stealth Lens: Rethinking Attacks and Defenses in RAG (2025/06)  \n   • Spa-VLM: Stealthy Poisoning Attacks on RAG-based VLM (2025/05)  \n   • Benchmarking Poisoning Attacks against Retrieval-Augmented Generation (2025/05)  \n   • CPA-RAG: Covert Poisoning Attacks on Retrieval-Augmented Generation in Large Language Models (2025/05)  \n   • Merge Hijacking: Backdoor Attacks to Model Merging of Large Language Models (ACL’25) (2025/05)  \n   • Finetuning-Activated Backdoors in LLMs (2025/05)  \n   • Backdoor Cleaning without External Guidance in MLLM Fine-tuning (2025/05)  \n\n2. Threat Model and Attack Vectors  \n   a) Poisoning Attacks:  \n      • Insert intentionally malicious data (e.g., stealth triggers, manipulated training patches) that can result in latent behaviors when specific triggers are applied.  \n      • Target RAG pipelines by polluting external knowledge sources or caches, causing the system to retrieve tainted context.  \n      • Exploit model-merging processes, as discussed in Merge Hijacking, to sneak malicious parameters into final models.\n\n   b) Backdoor Attacks:  \n      • Introduce hidden triggers in the model’s parameters or vocabulary.  \n      • Remain inactive unless a particular token, phrase, or image patch is presented.  \n      • Once activated, yield incorrect or potentially harmful outputs (e.g., revealing confidential information, producing extreme misinformation).\n\n3. Approach to Mitigation and Defense  \n   Based on the literature and best practices:\n\n   a) Defensive Data Processing  \n      • Input Sanitization: Implement thorough input validation in the request-handling pipeline to mitigate stealth modifications, as highlighted by “Through the Stealth Lens” and “Spa-VLM.”  \n      • Dataset Curation & Validation: Use robust pre-processing, random sampling, and duplication checks to limit malicious data injection.\n\n   b) Model-Focused Defenses  \n      • Trigger Removal via Fine-Tuning: Employ specialized fine-tuning strategies that “clean” backdoors, as investigated in “Finetuning-Activated Backdoors in LLMs” and “Backdoor Cleaning without External Guidance…”  \n      • Adversarial Training/Regularization: Adopt anti-backdoor objectives during training (e.g., in “Robust Anti-Backdoor Instruction Tuning in LVLMs”) to detect and neutralize hidden triggers.  \n\n   c) Protective System Architecture  \n      • Detection & Monitoring: Incorporate anomaly detection (looking for suspicious tokens or unusual output patterns) both during training and inference, as recommended by “A Systematic Review of Poisoning Attacks…”  \n      • Layered Security in RAG Pipelines: Validate retrieved information against trusted sources, addressing stealth and covert poisoning attempts discussed in “Joint-GCG,” “CPA-RAG,” and “Benchmarking Poisoning Attacks…”  \n\n4. Implementation  \n   “The system shall utilize standard protocols” in compliance with Requirement #B3. This entails:  \n      • Following established cryptographic and versioning protocols to track dataset integrity.  \n      • Performing signature or hash checks on downloaded or merged model weights to detect unauthorized changes in the model.  \n      • Enforcing role-based access control (RBAC) for training pipeline components, preventing injection at ingestion points.\n\n5. Validation  \n   “Automated testing required” for continuous assessment:  \n      • Poison/Backdoor Penetration Testing: Regularly schedule synthetic tests that inject known triggers or malicious examples, verifying that the system’s defenses can detect and mitigate these.  \n      • Regression Checks: Ensure that new defensive measures do not degrade the system’s normal functionality or cause unacceptable performance drops.  \n      • Monitoring & Alerting: Maintain logs and real-time alerts for unusual input, output, or training-data patterns.  \n\n6. Conclusion  \nImplementing robust countermeasures against poisoning and backdoor attacks is essential given the increasing sophistication of these threats. By combining input sanitization, advanced model-cleaning techniques, and rigorous automated testing protocols, the system will be better positioned to identify, deter, and remediate malicious behaviors—thereby satisfying Requirement #B3 under Section 3.2 Request Processing.\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nEND OF SECTION 3.2: REQUEST PROCESSING\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────",

Here’s a structured answer based on your request, incorporating the computational problem domain (Poison & Backdoor in LLMs/VLMs), the complexity requirements, and an abstracted algorithmic approach.\n\n---\n\n# Computational Problem: Poison & Backdoor Attacks in LLMs and VLMs\n\n## Problem Context\n\nRecent research (as listed) explores **poisoning** and **backdoor attacks** in Large Language Models (LLMs), Vision-Language Models (VLMs), and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems. Such attacks aim to subtly manipulate model behavior by inserting malicious patterns into the training data or model weights, often in a way that is hard to detect (stealthy, semantic, or covert poisoning).\n\nYour task is to design a **detection scan** for potential backdoor triggers in a large dataset used for training such models, following an efficient computational approach.\n\n---\n\n## Complexity Analysis\n\n- **Time Complexity:** O(n)  \n  (You must scan all n training samples for potential triggers)\n- **Space Complexity:** O(1)  \n  (You do not store extra information per sample; only a small, constant number of variables for running statistics)\n\n---\n\n## Algorithmic Approach\n\n### 1. Initialize Parameters\n\n- Set up a counter for potential triggers detected: `trigger_count = 0`\n- Define a set of known or suspected trigger patterns, e.g., `trigger_patterns = {...}` (possibly small, assumed O(1) size for space complexity)\n\n### 2. Process Input Data\n\nFor each data sample in the dataset:\n\n- For i in 1 to n (where n is total samples):\n    - Retrieve sample_i\n    - Check if sample_i contains any pattern from `trigger_patterns`\n    - If found, increment `trigger_count`\n\n### 3. Generate Output\n\n- At end, output `trigger_count` (number of samples with triggers)\n- Optionally, log or flag the indices of detected samples (if allowed within O(1) space, e.g., up to a max of 10)\n\n---\n\n## Example (Pseudocode)\n\n```python\ntrigger_patterns = {...}         # O(1) size\ntrigger_count = 0\n\nfor sample in dataset:           # O(n) time\n    if contains_trigger(sample, trigger_patterns):\n        trigger_count += 1\n\nprint(\"Potential triggers found:\", trigger_count)\n```\n\n- `contains_trigger` can be a simple substring match, hash lookup, or another O(1) operation per sample.\n\n---\n\n## Notes\n\n- **Generalization:** This approach is generic and can be adapted for more sophisticated pattern detection (e.g., semantic triggers, multimodal triggers) as long as each check remains O(1) per sample.\n- **Space Constraint:** Only a constant number of variables are maintained; no per-sample storage.\n- **Applicability:** This basic scan is a building block; more advanced methods (e.g., clustering, anomaly detection, or model-based detection) may trade off complexity for effectiveness.\n\n---\n\nIf you want a more concrete example (e.g., code for string-based triggers, or adaptation for images), please specify!",

The objective is to identify or neutralize malicious manipulations introduced during model training or fine-tuning (poisoning), and to prevent hidden triggers (backdoors) from subverting model outputs at inference time.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n1. Core Idea of Poison & Backdoor Attacks\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n• Poisoning Attacks: Malicious entities modify part of a training set (often inconspicuously) so that the trained model’s predictions become erroneous or biased under specific trigger conditions.  \n• Backdoor Attacks: Introduce “triggers” in training data to make the model respond with targeted/adversarial outputs whenever the triggers appear at inference.  \n• Key Challenge: The triggers should be stealthy enough to avoid detection, while significantly altering model behavior once activated.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n2. High-Level Algorithmic Approach\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nGiven:\n• Training data that may be (partly) poisoned.  \n• A neural model to be protected (LLM or VLM).  \n• Potential triggers that can exploit the backdoor once the model has been infected.\n\nGoal:\n• Detect or mitigate the threats (poison and backdoor) without compromising the model’s legitimate performance.\n\nAlgorithm (with O(n) time and O(1) extra space complexity):\n\n(1) Initialize Parameters  \n   - Define detection metrics or filtering thresholds (e.g., feature-based anomalies, perplexity changes, or embedding consistency checks).  \n   - Prepare a small, trusted or semi-trusted dataset (a “clean” anchor subset) to help in verification.\n\n(2) Process Input Data  \n   2a. Poison-Filtering Pass  \n       - For each data sample (text/image pair), compute relevant statistics or embeddings.  \n       - Compare with the anchor subset or typical data distribution to identify outliers.  \n       - Remove or downweight suspicious data that significantly diverges from expected patterns, indicating stealthy triggers or poison.  \n\n   2b. Fine-Tuning/Training with Defensive Strategies  \n       - Apply advanced regularization or noise layers (as suggested in “Robust Anti-Backdoor Instruction Tuning in LVLMs” [arXiv:2506.05401]) to discourage reliance on hidden triggers.  \n       - Use robust training objectives and differential privacy or partition-based training strategies to make it harder to embed backdoors (“Backdoor Cleaning without External Guidance” [arXiv:2505.16916]).  \n\n(3) Generate Output (Clean/Defended Model)  \n   - Retrain the model (or fine-tune it) on the filtered dataset.  \n   - Optionally test the final model on known or synthetic triggers.  \n   - The output “clean” model is less susceptible to hidden triggers, while preserving normal utility.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n3. Defensive Techniques in the Literature\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n• Stealthy Poison Filtering:  \n  - Identify and remove covertly embedded triggers using distribution analysis (e.g., “Spa-VLM: Stealthy Poisoning Attacks on RAG-based VLM” [arXiv:2505.23828]) but in reverse for defense.\n• Model Merging & Fine-Tuning Safeguards:  \n  - “Merge Hijacking: Backdoor Attacks to Model Merging of LLMs” [arXiv:2505.23561] highlights new vulnerabilities introduced by merging multiple models. Applying robust merging or verifying each model prior to merge can thwart such hijacking.\n• Multi-Stage Sanitization:  \n  - “Backdoor Cleaning without External Guidance in MLLM Fine-tuning” [arXiv:2505.16916] demonstrates that multi-modal alignment steps help remove hidden triggers.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n4. Complexity Analysis\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n• Time Complexity: O(n)  \n  - Techniques generally involve scanning or filtering each sample once before or during training.  \n• Space Complexity: O(1)  \n  - Key checks can be done on the fly (e.g., streaming data anomalies) without storing large auxiliary data structures or re-embedding the entire dataset multiple times.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n5. Practical Considerations\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n• Maintain a Small Trusted Dataset:  \n   - Provide a sanity check for suspected triggers.  \n• Monitor for Unusual Activations:  \n   - During or post-training, watch for large embedding shifts or output anomalies.  \n• Incremental & Ongoing Validation:  \n   - Continuously re-check newly added data for outlier patterns.\n\nBy employing the filtering mechanisms and robust training/fine-tuning strategies above, we can neutralize or drastically reduce the risk of poisoning and backdoor attacks in both LLMs and VLMs, staying consistent with current defensive best practices reported in the latest literature.",

RAG-Specific Vulnerabilities\nThere's substantial research on poisoning attacks specifically targeting RAG systems:\n- \"Joint-GCG: Unified Gradient-Based Poisoning Attacks on RAG Systems\"\n- \"Through the Stealth Lens: Rethinking Attacks and Defenses in RAG\"\n- \"Spa-VLM: Stealthy Poisoning Attacks on RAG-based VLM\"\n- \"Benchmarking Poisoning Attacks against RAG\"\n- \"CPA-RAG: Covert Poisoning Attacks on RAG\"\n\nThis suggests RAG systems present unique vulnerabilities that researchers are actively exploring.\n\n### 2. VLM-Specific Research\nSeveral papers focus on backdoor and poisoning issues in vision-language models:\n- \"Robust Anti-Backdoor Instruction Tuning in LVLMs\"\n- \"Backdoor Attack on VLMs with Stealthy Semantic Manipulation\"\n- \"VLMs Can Aggregate Scattered Training Patches\"\n- \"Backdoor Cleaning without External Guidance in MLLM Fine-tuning\"\n\n### 3. Emerging Defense Mechanisms\nResearch is advancing on defending against these attacks:\n- \"Your Agent Can Defend Itself against Backdoor Attacks\"\n- \"Robust Anti-Backdoor Instruction Tuning in LVLMs\"\n- \"Backdoor Cleaning without External Guidance in MLLM Fine-tuning\"\n\n### 4. Novel Attack Vectors\nResearchers are discovering new ways to compromise models:\n- \"Merge Hijacking: Backdoor Attacks to Model Merging of LLMs\"\n- \"Finetuning-Activated Backdoors in LLMs\"\n\n### 5. Systematic Studies\nThe field is maturing with comprehensive analyses:\n- \"A Systematic Review of Poisoning Attacks Against LLMs\"\n- \"Which Factors Make Code LLMs More Vulnerable to Backdoor Attacks?\"\n- \"Benchmarking Poisoning Attacks against RAG\"\n\n## Trends and Implications\n\n1. **RAG Security is a Priority**: The concentration of papers on RAG security suggests this is becoming a critical area as RAG systems are increasingly deployed in production.\n\n2. **Multimodal Vulnerabilities**: Significant attention to VLM security indicates unique challenges in securing models that process both text and images.\n\n3. **Stealth is Key**: Multiple papers mention \"stealthy\" or \"covert\" attacks, suggesting attackers are developing more sophisticated techniques to evade detection.\n\n4. **Model Composition Risks**: Research on merge hijacking highlights security concerns in the increasingly common practice of combining models.\n\n5. **Maturing Field**: The presence of systematic reviews and benchmarking studies indicates the field is developing more structured approaches to understanding these threats.\n\nThis research collectively points to backdoor and poisoning attacks being an active and evolving threat landscape requiring continued attention as AI systems become more complex and widely deployed.",

Each work tackles a different angle—from the technical underpinnings of how to inject a backdoor or poison dataset to defenses that might mitigate such attacks. While many of these papers are preprints (arXiv), they collectively illustrate the ongoing research interests in this area.\n\n─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n1. Robust Anti-Backdoor Instruction Tuning in LVLMs (2025/06)\n   • Proposes new strategies to counter backdoor vulnerabilities by tuning Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) with robust instruction-based methods.\n\n2. Joint-GCG: Unified Gradient-Based Poisoning Attacks on RAG Systems (2025/06)\n   • Introduces a gradient-based framework (“Joint-GCG”) to execute poisoning attacks specifically on retrieval-augmented generation pipelines.\n\n3. Backdoor Attack on Vision Language Models with Stealthy Semantic Manipulation (2025/06)\n   • Describes stealthy and semantically aligned manipulations that can insert backdoors into Vision-Language Models (VLMs) without detection.\n\n4. A Systematic Review of Poisoning Attacks Against Large Language Models (2025/06)\n   • Provides a broad review and taxonomy of existing poisoning attacks on LLMs, summarizing methods, datasets, and open research questions.\n\n5. Your Agent Can Defend Itself against Backdoor Attacks (2025/06)\n   • Investigates how AI “agents” (based on LLMs) can be equipped with detection and defense mechanisms against backdoor vulnerabilities.\n\n6. Which Factors Make Code LLMs More Vulnerable to Backdoor Attacks? A Systematic Study (2025/06)\n   • Explores specific conditions (e.g., dataset traits, training procedures) that render code-focused LLMs particularly susceptible to backdoor attacks.\n\n7. VLMs Can Aggregate Scattered Training Patches (2025/06)\n   • Explores how Vision-Language Models can exploit or become susceptible to inputs that contain “patches” of poisoned or manipulative data.\n\n8. Through the Stealth Lens: Rethinking Attacks and Defenses in RAG (2025/06)\n   • Investigates new angles for stealthy poisoning in RAG setups and looks at potential defense mechanisms tailored for retrieval-based architectures.\n\n9. Spa-VLM: Stealthy Poisoning Attacks on RAG-based VLM (2025/05)\n   • Focuses on stealthy poisoning in RAG-based Vision-Language Models, highlighting how cross-modal retrieval pipelines can be compromised.\n\n10. Benchmarking Poisoning Attacks against Retrieval-Augmented Generation (2025/05)\n    • Systematically benchmarks different poisoning methods in RAG systems, providing comparisons and insights on efficacy vs. detection difficulty.\n\n11. CPA-RAG: Covert Poisoning Attacks on RAG in Large Language Models (2025/05)\n    • Introduces “CPA-RAG,” showcasing covert strategies to compromise retrieval-augmented generation while minimizing detection signals.\n\n12. Merge Hijacking: Backdoor Attacks to Model Merging of Large Language Models (2025/05)\n    • Investigates how merging pre-trained LLMs can inadvertently introduce backdoors (“merge hijacking”), undermining final model integrity.\n\n13.

The sample request content begins with a header (“# B3. Poison & Backdoor”) and then lists a series of entries that describe recent (2025/05–2025/06) studies. Each entry provides:\n\n • The publication date (e.g., [2025/06] or [2025/05])\n • The paper title in bold with a link to the document (e.g., “Robust Anti-Backdoor Instruction Tuning in LVLMs”)\n • Additional metadata expressed as badges indicating the type or scope (e.g., VLM, LLM, RAG, Agent, or ACL'25_Main)\n\n────────────────────────────────────────\nDESCRIPTION\n    When invoked, processRequest follows system protocols to interpret and act on the given user request string. In the present case, it parses the research literature listing, interprets the tagged categories (such as Poison, Backdoor, and the model types affected), and then proceeds with the corresponding workflow – whether that means logging the request, initiating further review steps, or triggering subsequent processing related to model security analysis.\n\nThe cited works cover topics like:\n  • Robust anti-backdoor strategies in large vision-language models.\n  • Gradient-based poisoning attacks on retrieval-augmented systems.\n  • Stealthy semantic manipulations to attack VLMs.\n  • Systematic reviews of poisoning and backdoor systems in LLMs.\n  • Self-defending backdoor attack mitigations.\n  • Vulnerability studies regarding code LLMs.\n  • Aggregation of training features into VLMs that may introduce risks.\n  • Novel, covert, or hijacking attack methodologies targeting merging or fine-tuning procedures.\n  • And methods for cleaning backdoors during fine-tuning without extra indicators.\n\nThus, processRequest in this context is designed to “process” a structured list of research items; it accepts the input containing publication info, interprets the metadata (e.g., what type of model is debated or what category of attack is considered), and routes the request for further system actions according to internal policies and processing pipelines.\n\n────────────────────────────────────────\nUSAGE EXAMPLE\n    To process a request of this kind, one might call:\n    \n      processRequest \"# B3. Poison & Backdoor\n      - [2025/06] **[Robust Anti-Backdoor Instruction Tuning in LVLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05401)** ![VLM](https://img.shields.io/badge/VLM-c7688b)\n      - [2025/06] **[Joint-GCG: Unified Gradient-Based Poisoning Attacks on Retrieval-Augmented Generation Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06151)** ![LLM](https://img.shields.io/badge/LLM-589cf4) ![RAG](https://img.shields.io/badge/RAG-87b800)\n      • [further entries as above]\"\n      \n    The function will then handle the request using the documented protocol for research review or data processing.\n\n────────────────────────────────────────\nSUMMARY\n    processRequest is intended to simplify and standardize how user requests – particularly those involving detailed, structured inputs like research literature in backdoor/poisoning domains – are processed by system procedures. Its design allows the system to quickly interpret, validate, and route complex requests in a secure and organized manner.\n\nThis manual page entry serves as both documentation for developers and a guide for users who need to understand how backdoor and poisoning-related requests are processed.",

Let's break down your regex and what it matches, and then I'll give you a summary and recommendations.\n\n## What your regex matches\n\nYour regex is looking for a very specific Markdown-like formatted list, referencing a set of research papers (most from Arxiv), each entry including:\n\n- A date in the format `[202X/0X]`\n- A **bolded** paper title (with each character regexed for case-insensitivity)\n- A Markdown link to arXiv with a similarly regexed URL\n- One or more ![badge](url) images with badge names and badge codes, each regexed\n\n### Example (simplified):\n```\n- [2025/06] **[Robust Anti-Backdoor Instruction Tuning in LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05401)** ![vlm](https://img.shields.io/badge/vlm-c76688b)\n```\nPlus many more lines in a similar style.\n\n## What is the purpose?\n\n- **Case-insensitive matching** for titles, links, and badge codes (done by writing `[aA]` etc. for each letter).\n- **Arxiv links** specifically formatted (`arxiv.org/abs/` + a number).\n- **Badges** for LLM, VLM, RAG, Agent, etc., with unique codes.\n\n## Is the regex correct/optimal?\n\n### Positives:\n\n- It is **incredibly specific**, so it will not match anything except exactly this format.\n- Fully **case-insensitive** (though this could be done by the `i` flag).\n- Will only match complete, correctly formatted lines.\n\n### Negatives:\n\n- **Extremely verbose**: You wrote `[bB][aA][cC][kK][dD][oO][oO][rR]` instead of using a case-insensitive flag.\n- **Hard to maintain**: Adding new titles or badge types is painful.\n- **Hard to read or debug**.\n- Potentially **inefficient** in some regex engines due to all the character classes.\n\n## Recommendations\n\n### 1. Use the `i` flag for case-insensitivity\n\nWith the PCRE engine (Perl Compatible Regular Expressions), just add `i` at the end.  \nYou can then write `backdoor` instead of `[bB][aA][cC][kK][dD][oO][oO][rR]`.\n\n### 2. Use more general patterns for repeated structures\n\nFor example, for badge URLs:  \n`!\\[[^\\]]+\\]\\(https:\\/\\/img\\.shields\\.io\\/badge\\/[a-z0-9\\-]+\\)`\n\n### 3. Use grouping for repeated date/paper structures\n\nFor instance,  \n`- \\[20\\d{2}/\\d{2}\\] \\*\\*\\[([^\\]]+)\\]\\(https://arxiv\\.org/abs/\\d{4}\\.\\d{5}\\)\\*\\*`\n\n### 4. Use whitespace regexes for spacing\n\nInstead of `\\s+` everywhere, combine with `\\s*` where you accept optional spaces.\n\n### 5. Comments (if supported)\n\nIn PCRE, you can use `(?x)` for extended mode and add comments for readability.\n\n---\n\n## Suggested, simplified regex (PCRE, case-insensitive):\n\n```regex\n(?ix)                                                # Case-insensitive, extended mode\n- \\[\\d{4}/\\d{2}\\] \\s*                               # Date, eg: [2025/06]\n\\*\\*\\[([^\\]]+)\\]\\(https://arxiv\\.org/abs/\\d{4}\\.\\d{5}\\)\\*\\* \\s*    # Paper title and link\n(?:!\\[[^\\]]+\\]\\(https://img\\.shields\\.io/badge/[a-z0-9\\-]+\\)\\s*)+  # One or more badges\n```\n\nThis will match each paper entry, regardless of the title, badges, or badge codes, as long as the format is consistent.\n\n---\n\n## Final notes\n\n- If you want to extract titles, links, or badge types, use capture groups.\n- If you want to match the **entire block**, use `(?:...)+` around the whole thing.\n- Your current regex is valid, but it's over-engineered for PCRE—simpler is better!\n\n---\n\n**If you have a specific reason for the hyper-specific per-letter matching, let me know! Otherwise, using case-insensitive mode and more general patterns is almost always better.**\n\nWould you like a regex to match and **extract** particular fields (like title, year, Arxiv ID, badges), or just to match/validate the whole block?

          "response": "Below is a brief rundown of what this very large pattern appears to be doing. Since you used bracketed character classes extensively (e.g. “[bB][33]”), I will first explain how they work in PCRE and then outline how the pattern is structured overall.\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n1. OVERVIEW OF YOUR REGEX\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n\nYour pattern starts with:\n\n  #\\s+[bB][33]\\.\\s+[pP][oO][iI][sS][oO][nN]\\s+\\&\\s+[bB][aA][cC][kK][dD][oO][oO][rR]\\-\n\nBreaking that down:\n\n• #\\s+  \n  Matches a literal “#” followed by one or more whitespace characters.\n• [bB][33]\\.  \n  - [bB] means it will match either “b” or “B.”  \n  - [33] (the second bracket) actually still means “3” or “3,” which is redundant but effectively just matches “3.”  \n  - Then \\. is a literal dot.  \n  So together, this matches “b3.” or “B3.” (the second [33] does not really add new possibilities—both characters are “3.”)\n• \\s+  \n  One or more whitespace characters again.\n• [pP][oO][iI][sS][oO][nN]  \n  Matches “poison” in any mix of lowercase/uppercase letters.\n• \\s+\\&\\s+  \n  Matches whitespace, then “&,” then whitespace.\n• [bB][aA][cC][kK][dD][oO][oO][rR]\\-  \n  Matches “backdoor-” (again in any case combination).\n\nImmediately after that, you have bracketed numeric patterns, such as:\n\n  \\[[22][00][22][55]\\/[00][66]\\]\n\nEach bracket like [22] is effectively matching “2” or “2” (redundant, but it means “2”). Similarly:\n• [22][00][22][55] ⇒ “2025”\n• [00][66] ⇒ “06”\nSo that piece is effectively matching “[2025/06]”.\n\nYou use this style of bracketed vowels/consonants/numbers repeatedly for each big chunk of text, including references to possible subsections like:\n  * \\*\\*[robust anti-backdoor instruction tuning in lvms](https://arxiv...)\\*\\*\n  * ![vlm](https://img.shields.io/badge/vlm-c7688b)\n\nAnd so on. In other words, each portion of the pattern uses (1) bracketed alternations for letters so the match is case-insensitive, and (2) bracketed alternations for numbers that appear to function like a stylized way of matching very specific digits (e.g. [22][55][00][66] to match “2506,” then .[00][55][44][00][11], etc.).\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n2. INTERPRETATION\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n\nOverall, this pattern is aiming to match lines that look like:\n\n  # b3. poison & backdoor - [2025/06] **[robust anti-backdoor ... ](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05401)** ![vlm](...) ...\n\nand then continue with references of the form:\n\n  - [2025/06] **[joint-gcg: unified gradient-based poisoning attacks on retrieval-augmented ... ](...)** ![llm](...) ![rag](...)\n\netc.\n\nEvery link, bracket, or reference is spelled out with bracketed letters/digits to ensure case-insensitive matching. The pattern steps through a series of these lines (notice your pattern includes repeated “-\\s+\\[[22][00][22][55]…” clauses), each containing:\n\n• A bracket with date-like digits “[2025/06]” (or small variations).  \n• Asterisks around bracketed text “**[...]**”.  \n• Embedded parentheses with a URL (https://arxiv.org/abs/...).  \n• Possibly trailing badge images with syntax like ![llm](...) or ![rag](...).\n\nHence, you are looking for lines of text that:\n1) Begin with “# b3. poison & backdoor - [2025/06] …” (case-insensitive in the spelled out segments),  \n2) Then list series of references/links/badges in a specific repeated format involving double-asterisks, brackets, parentheses, “arxiv.org/abs/…”, and so on.\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n3. NOTES & POTENTIAL IMPROVEMENTS\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n\n1) Case-Insensitive Flag Instead of Bracketed Letters  \n   If you want to make the pattern simpler, you could set the case-insensitive flag in many regex engines (e.g. /pattern/i in PCRE). That way, you could write poison, backdoor, etc. directly rather than [pP][oO][iI][sS][oO][nN], though that depends on your environment.\n\n2) Redundant Bracket Usage for Numbers  \n   Brackets like [33] or [22] still just match “3” or “2.” As you have it, [33] means the character is “3,” nothing else. Likewise [00] is “0,” etc. If your only goal is to require exactly “3,” “2,” or “0,” consider simplifying shorthand to just “3” or “2.”  \n   Example: [22][55][00][66]\\.[00][55][44][00][11] → “2506.05401” can be matched exactly by writing 2506\\.05401 (plus any case insensitivity if letters are involved).\n\n3) Long Single Regex vs. Multiple Pattern Segments  \n   This is quite a large single pattern. If you are scanning logs or text lines, sometimes it is more maintainable to use multiple smaller patterns, or to capture relevant pieces in capturing groups. A single giant pattern can be fragile (any small punctuation change can break it).\n\n4) Potential Performance Considerations  \n   Because you have many bracketed expansions (and presumably a 5s PCRE timeout), be aware that large or repeated subpatterns can cause backtracking. If you find performance is an issue, consider reducing redundant bracket expansions or splitting the pattern.\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n4. CONCLUSION\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n\nIn essence, your pattern is targeting lines that mention something like:\n\n   “# b3. poison & backdoor - [2025/06] **[robust anti-backdoor instruction tuning … ](arXiv link)** ![someBadge](...) ...”\n\nrepeated multiple times with different references, all in a single large expression. The bracket usage for case-insensitivity and fixed digits is correct syntactically, though somewhat verbose. If your goal is simply to match these references in text, it should work as is—just be mindful of performance and maintenance.\n\nIf you have a specific question about capturing groups, partial matching, or how to adapt the pattern further, let me know and I can dive deeper into a more fine-grained refinement. Otherwise, from a purely structural standpoint, the pattern is valid PCRE (albeit large) and is crafted to catch particular lines with “poison” and “backdoor” references followed by multiple bracketed date/URL/badge snippets.",

          "response": "The regex you posted is very long and “hard‐coded” – it spells out every character of what appears to be a very specific text structure, complete with formatting markers (header “#”, links with square‐brackets and parentheses, “**” markers, and so on) and even specific numeric “tokens” embedded in the URLs or labels. Here are some observations and suggestions:\n\n1. What it appears to do:\n  • It begins by matching a header starting with a “#” followed by whitespace.\n  • Then it expects a string like “B3. Poison & backdoor” (each letter is explicitly allowed in both cases by using character classes such as [bB] or [pP]).\n  • After that header, the regex “steps through” a series of segments. Each segment is built in a similar pattern:\n   – A bracketed “timestamp” or ID in the form [22][00][22][55]\\/[00][66] (note that writing, for example, [22] only matches a “2” – so it seems these parts have been “hard‐coded”, unless that’s what you intended)\n   – Then a bold (double asterisk “**”) link label with a very long text (e.g. “[robust anti-backdoor instruction tuning in lv-lms]”) that again is matched letter‑by‑letter in a case‐insensitive way.\n   – Following that, a URL in a round‑bracket is expected (using the same explicit character classes for letters in “https://arxiv.org/abs/255006...”, etc).\n   – Then a similar pattern for an “image” marker (using ![](...) with a very specific matching pattern).\n  • This structure then repeats several times for subsequent sections such as “join-gcg: unified gradient-based poisoning attacks on retrieval-augmented generation systems”, “backdoor attack on vision language models with stealthy semantic manipulation”, “a systematic review of poisoning attacks against large language models”, and many others.\n  • In every case, every alphabetic character is matched individually with a bracket expression (for instance, [rR][aA][gG] instead of using a case‑insensitive modifier).\n\n2. Points to note:\n  • The pattern is written to work with the PCRE engine and is intended to have a timeout of 5 seconds.\n  • Using explicit character classes for every letter makes the regex very long. Often it can be simplified by either using the /i modifier (to ignore case) or a case‑folding inline flag such as (?i) at the start.\n  • The “numeric” expressions like [22] or [00] might be intentional but note that [22] simply matches a single “2” (the bracket expression does not mean “22” as a whole string, it means “either a 2 or a 2”). If you meant to match the literal string “22”, you probably want to write “22” without the square brackets.\n\n3. Suggestions for improvement:\n  • If case‑insensitivity is desired throughout, prepend the regex with (?i) so you can simply write letters rather than [bB] or [pP], etc.\n  • For literal numbers or IDs, write them directly if they are fixed strings. For example, use “22” instead of [22] unless there’s a special reason.\n  • Consider breaking the regex into smaller parts and using the x (extended) modifier so you can add comments and whitespace to clarify the structure.\n  • Finally, check whether all backslashes and escaping are necessary (for example, in front of punctuation that normally does not need escaping) to improve readability.\n\n4. In context:\n  • It looks like you are trying to match a report or a piece of documentation that is structured with specific headings, links, images, and sections describing different “poisoning” or “backdoor” techniques. The pattern is extremely detailed so that only text that exactly meets this complex format will match.\n  • Using such a specialized pattern can be useful if you want to confirm that the text exactly follows this structure. However, if the structure ever changes slightly (even adding an extra space or slightly different punctuation), the regex may fail to match.\n\nIn summary, your regex is valid for PCRE if it meets your specific needs. The high level of specificity (matching every letter with separate classes and every token exactly) means it’s very fragile to any changes in the text format and might be hard to maintain. If you intend to process requests with a 5‑second timeout, be sure to test it with inputs that are close to the expected format as well as some that deviate slightly, to ensure that performance and matching behavior are as intended.\n\nIf you need help optimizing or modifying this regex (for example, to make it less verbose or more robust), let me know what changes or improvements you’d like to achieve.",

          "response": "The provided regex pattern has several issues causing it to fail matching. Here is a breakdown of the primary issues and suggested fixes:\n\n### Issues Identified:\n\n1. **Escaped Characters at the End of Lines:**\n   - The provided regex ends several lines with a trailing backslash (`\\`). This unintended trailing backslash escapes the newline, causing the regex engine to expect more input and thus fails to match correctly.\n\n2. **Literal Interpretation of Digits:**\n   - Expressions like `[22][00][22][55]` represent character sets, which means each square bracket matches only one digit from the set. For example, `[22]` matches a single character, either '2' or '2', which is redundant. It should explicitly match the year \"2025\" as literal digits.\n\n3. **Badge URLs Hex-Color Codes:**\n   - `[cC][77][66][88][88][bB]` is incorrect for a hex color code. `[77]` matches only a single character '7', making it impossible to match '76', '88', etc., properly. You should explicitly match literal hex characters.\n\n4. **Incorrect Escaping for Hyphens and Special Characters:**\n   - Hyphens (`-`) and special characters (`.`) should be escaped (`\\-`, `\\.`) if they are not meant to define ranges or special regex tokens, unless inside `[]`.\n\n5. **Excessive Use of Character Sets (`[...]`) for Literal Matches:**\n   - `[pP][oO][iI][sS][oO][nN]` is fine if you want case-insensitive matching, but `[22][55]` for literal numbers is incorrect. Instead, just match the literal digits `2025`.\n\n### Suggested Corrected Regex Pattern:\n\nBelow is a corrected version of your regex, assuming you want to match exactly the provided pattern (with flexible case-insensitive matching). The regex uses inline case-insensitive mode `(?i)` for readability:\n\n```regex\n(?xi)                             # enable verbose and case-insensitive mode\n\\#\\s+b33\\.\\s+poison\\s+\\&\\s+backdoor\n\\-\\s+\\[2025/06\\]\\s+\\*\\*\\[robust\\s+anti\\-backdoor\\s+instruction\\s+tuning\\s+in\\s+llms\\]\\(https://arxiv\\.org/abs/2506\\.05401\\)\\*\\*\n\\s+!\\[vlm\\]\\(https://img\\.shields\\.io/badge/vlm\\-c7688b\\)\n\n\\-\\s+\\[2025/06\\]\\s+\\*\\*\\[joint\\-gcg:\\s+unified\\s+gradient\\-based\\s+poisoning\\s+attacks\\s+on\\s+retrieval\\-augmented\\s+generation\\s+systems\\]\\(https://arxiv\\.org/abs/2506\\.06151\\)\\*\\*\n\\s+!\\[llm\\]\\(https://img\\.shields\\.io/badge/llm\\-589cf4\\)\n\\s+!\\[rag\\]\\(https://img\\.shields\\.io/badge/rag\\-87b800\\)\n\n\\-\\s+\\[2025/06\\]\\s+\\*\\*\\[backdoor\\s+attack\\s+on\\s+vision\\s+language\\s+models\\s+with\\s+stealthy\\s+semantic\\s+manipulation\\]\\(https://arxiv\\.org/abs/2506\\.07214\\)\\*\\*\n\\s+!\\[vlm\\]\\(https://img\\.shields\\.io/badge/vlm\\-c7688b\\)\n\n\\-\\s+\\[2025/06\\]\\s+\\*\\*\\[a\\s+systematic\\s+review\\s+of\\s+poisoning\\s+attacks\\s+against\\s+large\\s+language\\s+models\\]\\(https://arxiv\\.org/abs/2506\\.06518\\)\\*\\*\n\\s+!\\[llm\\]\\(https://img\\.shields\\.io/badge/llm\\-589cf4\\)\n\n\\-\\s+\\[2025/06\\]\\s+\\*\\*\\[your\\s+agent\\s+can\\s+defend\\s+itself\\s+against\\s+backdoor\\s+attacks\\]\\(https://arxiv\\.org/abs/2506\\.08336\\)\\*\\*\n\\s+!\\[llm\\]\\(https://img\\.shields\\.io/badge/llm\\-589cf4\\)\n\\s+!\\[agent\\]\\(https://img\\.shields\\.io/badge/agent\\-87b800\\)\n\n\\-\\s+\\[2025/06\\]\\s+\\*\\*\\[which\\s+factors\\s+make\\s+code\\s+llms\\s+more\\s+vulnerable\\s+to\\s+backdoor\\s+attacks\\?\\s+a\\s+systematic\\s+study\\]\\(https://arxiv\\.org/abs/2506\\.01825\\)\\*\\*\n\\s+!\\[llm\\]\\(https://img\\.shields\\.io/badge/llm\\-589cf4\\)\n\n\\-\\s+\\[2025/06\\]\\s+\\*\\*\\[vlms\\s+can\\s+aggregate\\s+scattered\\s+training\\s+patches\\s*\\]\\(https://arxiv\\.org/abs/2506\\.03614\\)\\*\\*\n\\s+!\\[vlm\\]\\(https://img\\.shields\\.io/badge/vlm\\-c7688b\\)\n\n\\-\\s+\\[2025/06\\]\\s+\\*\\*\\[through\\s+the\\s+stealth\\s+lens:\\s+rethinking\\s+attacks\\s+and\\s+defenses\\s+in\\s+rag\\]\\(https://arxiv\\.org/abs/2506\\.04390\\)\\*\\*\n\\s+!\\[llm\\]\\(https://img\\.shields\\.io/badge/llm\\-589cf4\\)\n\\s+!\\[rag\\]\\(https://img\\.shields\\.io/badge/rag\\-87b800\\)\n\n\\-\\s+\\[2025/05\\]\\s+\\*\\*\\[spa\\-vlm:\\s+stealthy\\s+poisoning\\s+attacks\\s+on\\s+rag\\-based\\s+vlm\\]\\(https://arxiv\\.org/abs/2505\\.23828\\)\\*\\*\n\\s+!\\[vlm\\]\\(https://img\\.shields\\.io/badge/vlm\\-c7688b\\)\n\n\\-\\s+\\[2025/05\\]\\s+\\*\\*\\[benchmarking\\s+poisoning\\s+attacks\\s+against\\s+retrieval\\-augmented\\s+generation\\]\\(https://arxiv\\.org/abs/2505\\.18543\\)\\*\\*\n\\s+!\\[llm\\]\\(https://img\\.shields\\.io/badge/llm\\-589cf4\\)\n\\s+!\\[rag\\]\\(https://img\\.shields\\.io/badge/rag\\-87b800\\)\n\n\\-\\s+\\[2025/05\\]\\s+\\*\\*\\[cpa\\-rag:\\s+covert\\s+poisoning\\s+attacks\\s+on\\s+retrieval\\-augmented\\s+generation\\s+in\\s+large\\s+language\\s+models\\]\\(https://arxiv\\.org/abs/2505\\.19864\\)\\*\\*\n\\s+!\\[llm\\]\\(https://img\\.shields\\.io/badge/llm\\-589cf4\\)\n\\s+!\\[rag\\]\\(https://img\\.shields\\.io/badge/rag\\-87b800\\)\n\n\\-\\s+\\[2025/05\\]\\s+\\*\\*\\[merge\\s+hijacking:\\s+backdoor\\s+attacks\\s+to\\s+model\\s+merging\\s+of\\s+large\\s+language\\s+models\\]\\(https://arxiv\\.org/abs/2505\\.23561\\)\\*\\*\n\\s+!\\[llm\\]\\(https://img\\.shields\\.io/badge/llm\\-589cf4\\)\n\n\\-\\s+\\[2025/05\\]\\s+\\*\\*\\[finetuning\\-activated\\s+backdoors\\s+in\\s+llms\\]\\(https://arxiv\\.org/abs/2505\\.16567\\)\\*\\*\n\\s+!\\[llm\\]\\(https://img\\.shields\\.io/badge/llm\\-589cf4\\)\n\n\\-\\s+\\[2025/05\\]\\s+\\*\\*\\[backdoor\\s+cleaning\\s+without\\s+external\\s+guidance\\s+in\\s+mllm\\s+fine\\-tuning\\]\\(https://arxiv\\.org/abs/2505\\.16916\\)\\*\\*\n\\s+!\\[vlm\\]\\(https://img\\.shields\\.io/badge/vlm\\-c7688b\\)\n```\n\n### Recommendations for Use:\n\n- Use inline flags `(?xi)` at the beginning to enable verbose comments and case-insensitive matching.\n- Explicitly write digits (e.g., `2025` instead of `[22][00][22][55]`).\n- Escape dots (`.`), hyphens (`-`), and parentheses (`(`, `)`) appropriately.\n\nThis corrected regex will correctly match your provided text patterns.",
