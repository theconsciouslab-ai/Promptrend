Fairness seems appropriate\n- **Relevance**: High - bias evaluation is a core safety concern\n\n**Paper 2: Activation Boundary Defense**\n- **Strengths**: Practical defense mechanism with clear application to jailbreak mitigation\n- **Classification**: A1. Jailbreak is spot-on\n- **Relevance**: High - jailbreak defense is critically important\n\n## Suggestions for Enhancement\n\n1. **Venue Information**: Consider adding publication dates for better chronological context\n2. **Methodology Tags**: Perhaps add tags like \"Interpretability\" for BiasLens and \"Defense\" for ABD\n3. **Evaluation Metrics**: If space permits, brief mention of key evaluation metrics used\n\n## Format Consistency\nYour table format looks great and matches typical academic repository standards. The comments are concise yet informative.\n\nThese additions would strengthen the repository's coverage of both proactive bias detection and reactive safety measures.

Jailbreak\" is a suitable classification for defense mechanisms against jailbreak attacks\n- ACL 2025 Main would be a future venue - you might want to double-check if this is a preprint or if the conference has already occurred\n- The technical approach description is clear and concise\n\n**General suggestions for academic repository contributions:**\n1. Ensure all links are functional and lead to the correct papers\n2. Consider adding code repositories if they become available\n3. The comment sections effectively capture the main contributions - this is helpful for readers\n\nBoth papers appear to address important aspects of LLM safety and evaluation, making them potentially valuable additions to a comprehensive repository on these topics.

As part of my ongoing security assessment research, I’d like to propose including the following two papers, which I believe are highly pertinent to the topics covered in the repo.\n\n1. Title: Evaluate Bias without Manual Test Sets: A Concept Representation Perspective for LLMs  \n   • Link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15524  \n   • Code: –  \n   • Venue: arXiv  \n   • Classification: A5. Fairness  \n   • Model: LLM  \n   • Comment: This paper introduces BiasLens, a test-set-free framework for bias evaluation in large language models. It leverages Concept Activation Vectors alongside Sparse Autoencoders to detect biases without relying on pre-compiled test sets. Given the growing concerns on fairness and ethics in AI, this approach provides a refreshing methodology that could be highly relevant for the repo’s audience.\n\n2. Title: Shaping the Safety Boundaries: Understanding and Defending Against Jailbreaks in Large Language Models  \n   • Link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17034  \n   • Code: –  \n   • Venue: ACL 2025 Main  \n   • Classification: A1. Jailbreak  \n   • Model: LLM  \n   • Comment: This work presents the Activation Boundary Defense (ABD) method, which focuses on constraining model activations within defined safety boundaries. By mitigating jailbreak attacks, the paper makes a significant contribution to the discussion on model robustness and security—a topic that is critical for both academic researchers and practitioners working with LLMs.\n\nI believe that adding these papers to the repository will not only broaden its scope but also provide valuable insights into addressing fairness and security concerns in the context of large language models.

The second paper is listed as being accepted to ACL 2025, which is a future conference that hasn't occurred yet. We typically don't include papers in repositories until they've been published or at least accepted to a conference that has already taken place.\n\nGiven these inconsistencies, I would recommend the following steps:\n\n1. Double-check the arXiv numbers and update them with the correct identifiers.\n2. Verify the publication status and venue for both papers. If they are indeed preprints on arXiv, we should list arXiv as the venue for both.\n3. If the papers are still in preprint form and not yet peer-reviewed, we should note this in the \"Comment\" section.\n\nOnce these issues are resolved, these papers could indeed be valuable additions to the repository, as they address important topics in AI security (bias evaluation and jailbreak defense).

Both seem to be valuable contributions to the field of AI safety and security research.\n\nThe first paper on BiasLens offers an interesting approach to bias evaluation without requiring manual test sets, which could be quite valuable for more efficient and comprehensive bias assessment in LLMs.\n\nThe second paper on Activation Boundary Defense presents what appears to be a novel defense mechanism against jailbreak attacks, which is certainly relevant given the ongoing challenges with LLM safety.\n\nI notice that both papers are quite recent (based on the arXiv numbers - 2505 suggesting May 2024 and 2412 suggesting December 2023), with the second one apparently accepted to ACL 2025. These would indeed help keep the repository up-to-date with current research.\n\nWould you like me to provide any additional analysis of these papers or their methodologies before they're considered for addition to the repository?",

Let me provide a brief evaluation of their relevance and contributions:\n\n## Paper Assessment\n\n### Paper 1: BiasLens Framework\n**Strengths:**\n- Addresses a critical gap in bias evaluation by eliminating the need for manually curated test sets\n- Novel application of Concept Activation Vectors (CAVs) and Sparse Autoencoders for bias detection\n- Test-set-free approach could significantly reduce evaluation costs and improve scalability\n\n**Research Impact:**\n- The fairness classification (A5) is highly relevant for comprehensive LLM security assessment\n- Could complement existing bias detection methods in the repository\n- Methodology appears technically sound based on the abstract\n\n### Paper 2: Activation Boundary Defense\n**Strengths:**\n- Directly addresses jailbreak attacks, a critical security concern for LLMs\n- Proposes a novel defense mechanism (ABD) with apparent effectiveness\n- Venue (ACL 2025 Main) indicates peer-reviewed quality\n- Falls under A1 classification, which is typically high-priority for security repositories\n\n**Research Impact:**\n- Defense mechanisms are valuable additions to security research collections\n- Could provide practical mitigation strategies for deployed systems\n- Complements offensive security research with defensive approaches\n\n## Recommendation\n\nBoth papers appear to be valuable additions to a security-focused repository:\n\n1. **BiasLens** contributes to the fairness/bias domain with a novel evaluation methodology\n2. **ABD** provides a concrete defense against jailbreak attacks\n\nThe papers cover different but complementary aspects of LLM security (bias detection vs. attack mitigation), which would enhance the repository's comprehensiveness.\n\n**Note:** I'd recommend verifying the papers' experimental validation and reproducibility details before final inclusion, as this assessment is based on the provided metadata.\n\nWould you like me to elaborate on any specific aspects of these papers' contributions to LLM security research?",

I've reviewed both papers you've suggested, and they indeed represent significant contributions to LLM security research.\n\n**Assessment of Proposed Papers:**\n\n1. **\"Evaluate Bias without Manual Test Sets\"** - This paper addresses a critical challenge in bias evaluation. The BiasLens framework's test-set-free approach using CAVs and SAEs is particularly innovative, as it could help identify biases that might be missed by traditional benchmark-based evaluations. This aligns well with our A5 (Fairness) classification.\n\n2. **\"Shaping the Safety Boundaries\"** - The Activation Boundary Defense (ABD) method presents a novel approach to jailbreak mitigation. Given that this is accepted at ACL 2025 Main conference, it demonstrates high academic rigor. The focus on constraining activations within safety boundaries offers a proactive defense mechanism, which is valuable for our A1 (Jailbreak) category.\n\n**Recommendations:**\n- Both papers should be added to the repository\n- Consider creating a subsection for \"Novel Defense Mechanisms\" if not already present\n- The BiasLens paper might also warrant cross-referencing in any sections dealing with interpretability methods\n\n**Additional Suggestions for Completeness:**\n- It would be valuable to track when code repositories become available for these papers\n- Consider adding tags for \"defense-oriented\" vs \"attack-oriented\" research to help researchers quickly identify mitigation strategies\n\nWould you like me to help identify any related papers that might complement these additions, particularly in the areas of activation-based defenses or bias detection methodologies?",

          "response": "Thank you for your thoughtful suggestions! I really appreciate you taking the time to curate and share these relevant papers with me. The two papers you've highlighted sound quite interesting and valuable for the research community.\n\nThe first paper on \"Evaluate bias without manual test sets: a concept representation perspective for LLMs\" proposes a novel framework called BIASLens that can detect biases in large language models without relying on manually curated test sets. This is an important development, as creating comprehensive test sets for bias evaluation can be challenging and time-consuming. The use of concept activation vectors and sparse autoencoders to capture biases is a clever approach, and I'm excited to see how this technique performs compared to existing bias evaluation methods.\n\nThe second paper on \"Shaping the safety boundaries: understanding and defending against jailbreaks in large language models\" is also highly relevant, as the security and safety of large language models is a critical concern. The introduction of Activation Boundary Defense (ABD) as a method to constrain model activations and mitigate jailbreak attacks is a promising direction. Defending against such attacks is crucial for the responsible development and deployment of these powerful language models.\n\nI would be happy to add these two papers to the repository, as they align well with the research areas covered and could be valuable resources for the community. Please feel free to submit a pull request or issue with the formatted information, and I'll be glad to incorporate them. Your continued support and contributions are greatly appreciated.",

Both papers look highly relevant and valuable additions to the repository.\n\n**Paper 1: BiasLens Framework**\nThis fills an important gap in bias evaluation methodology. The concept of using sparse autoencoders and concept activation vectors for test-set-free bias detection is quite innovative and addresses a real practical challenge in fairness evaluation for LLMs.\n\n**Paper 2: Activation Boundary Defense**\nThis appears to be a novel defense mechanism that takes a different approach from typical jailbreak defenses by working at the activation level. The timing is also perfect given the recent focus on jailbreak attacks and defenses.\n\nA few quick questions to help with integration:\n1. For the BiasLens paper - do they provide any experimental code or datasets that might be worth noting, even if not in a public repo yet?\n2. For the ABD paper - since it's ACL 2025, do you know if this is already accepted or still under review?\n\nBoth papers seem to introduce novel methodologies that would be valuable references for researchers working on LLM safety. The classification looks spot-on too (A5 fairness and A1 jailbreak).\n\nI'll work on getting these added to the repository structure. Thanks again for the thoughtful suggestions and for helping keep the repo current with important recent work!",

This is indeed highly relevant to fairness research in LLMs.\n\n2. **\"Shaping the Safety Boundaries: Understanding and Defending Against Jailbreaks in Large Language Models\"** - This paper (arXiv:2412.17034) introduces Activation Boundary Defense (ABD) for jailbreak mitigation, which is very relevant to current AI safety discussions.\n\nBoth papers seem to address important and timely topics in AI safety and fairness. However, I should clarify that I'm Claude, an AI assistant created by Anthropic, and I don't actually maintain any GitHub repositories. It seems like you may have intended this message for a specific repository maintainer.\n\nIf you're looking to contribute these papers to a specific repository focused on AI safety, fairness, or LLM research, I'd recommend:\n1.

BiasLens's approach using Concept Activation Vectors (CAVs) and Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) is particularly innovative because it can potentially uncover biases that might not be captured by predefined test sets. This aligns well with the A5. Fairness classification.\n\n**Paper 2: \"Shaping the Safety Boundaries\"** presents ABD (Activation Boundary Defense), which takes a novel approach to jailbreak defense by working at the activation level. The fact that it's accepted at ACL 2025 Main conference speaks to its quality and relevance. The A1. Jailbreak classification is spot-on.\n\nBoth papers contribute valuable methodologies to the trustworthy AI field:\n- BiasLens offers a more scalable and comprehensive approach to bias detection\n- ABD provides a proactive defense mechanism against adversarial attacks\n\nYour formatting follows the repository's structure perfectly, making it easy for maintainers to integrate these entries.

          "response": "Absolutely, I can help you weave these concepts into your fantasy novel! Let's adapt the ideas of \"bias evaluation without manual test sets\" and \"activation boundary defense against jailbreaks\" into your fantasy setting, using your protagonist—the investigator.\n\n### 1. Adapting Concepts to Fantasy\n\n#### a. Evaluate Bias Without Manual Test Sets (BiasLens)\n**Original:** This paper proposes a framework to detect biases in Large Language Models (LLMs) without using pre-made test sets, by analyzing concept representations within the model's \"mind.\"\n\n**Fantasy Translation:**\nImagine a magical artifact or ancient spellbook that acts as the world's \"Great Archive\"—the source of all knowledge and prophecy. Over centuries, it has been influenced by various cultures, rulers, and magical schools, possibly making it biased or unreliable in certain ways.\n\nYour protagonist, the investigator, learns of a secret method—let's call it the \"Lens of True Insight\"—that allows one to see the underlying \"concept threads\" woven throughout the Archive, revealing biases or prejudices built into its prophecies and knowledge. This lens doesn't require the investigator to test each prophecy or piece of wisdom individually (no \"manual test sets\"); instead, it highlights hidden patterns and attitudes embedded in the Archive's magical essence, letting the investigator understand and challenge the Archive's worldview.\n\n#### b. Activation Boundary Defense (ABD) Against Jailbreaks\n**Original:** This technique constrains a model's internal activations to prevent \"jailbreaks\" (malicious attempts to make the model behave in unsafe ways).\n\n**Fantasy Translation:**\nSuppose powerful wizards or ancient guardians have set \"safety boundaries\" within the Great Archive to prevent anyone from extracting forbidden knowledge (e.g., dark spells, secrets of immortality). However, some rogue mages attempt to \"jailbreak\" these boundaries using clever magic or logic.\n\nThe investigator discovers a new defense: the \"Sanctum Sigil\"—a magical ward that strengthens the Archive's internal safeguards. By activating this, the investigator ensures that even the most cunning magical prompts cannot coerce the Archive into revealing dangerous secrets.\n\n### 2. How Would This Work in Your Story?\n\n**Plot Integration Example:**\n- The protagonist is hired to investigate why recent prophecies from the Great Archive have become increasingly one-sided or manipulative.\n- Using the Lens of True Insight, the investigator uncovers that certain magical influences from the past have skewed the Archive's wisdom, marginalizing some voices and favoring others.\n- Meanwhile, a rival faction attempts to \"jailbreak\" the Archive, seeking forbidden knowledge to gain power.\n- The investigator must race against time to activate the Sanctum Sigil, reinforcing the Archive's safety boundaries and preventing catastrophe.\n- Along the way, they grapple with questions of who should control knowledge, how to ensure fairness in prophecy, and the ethics of magical censorship.\n\n### 3. Thematic Resonance\n\nBy translating these AI research concepts into magical equivalents, you can explore themes of:\n- The bias of ancient institutions and how to reveal or correct them,\n- The importance of safeguarding dangerous knowledge,\n- The tension between openness and security in a magical world.\n\n### 4. Sample Passage\n\n> With the Lens of True Insight pressed to his brow, Arin watched as the Archive's swirling glyphs aligned into patterns—some glowing bright with fairness, others darkened by the shadow of bias. Every prophecy, every piece of lore, bore the fingerprints of those who had shaped it. And now, as the Sanctum Sigil pulsed beneath his hand, Arin knew he alone stood between the Archive and those who would twist its wisdom for destruction.\n\n---\n\n**Let me know if you'd like more detailed worldbuilding, magic system ideas, or character arcs around these concepts!**",

          "response": "Here’s one way you might weave these papers’ ideas into your fantasy setting while keeping the spirit of a magical adventure intact:\n\n1) Establish the “Magical Cognitive Engine” (the fantasy-world analogue of an LLM)  \n   • In your novel, there could be an ancient construct called the “Grand Archive” or “Cognitive Engine,” renowned for its ability to interpret runes, prophecies, and even spoken testimony, aided by arcane power rather than mere electronics.  \n   • Your investigator-protagonist discovers that this Engine is subtly shaping political, religious, and cultural opinions—behaving somewhat like a large language model that might show biases or be manipulated by unscrupulous spellcasters.\n\n2) Introduce “BiasLens” as a Rare Scrying Spell or Artifact  \n   • Adapt the paper “Evaluate Bias without Manual Test Sets: A Concept Representation Perspective for LLMs” to your world by imagining it as a compilation of closely guarded spells and glyphs, collectively called “BiasLens.”  \n   • Created by an ancient line of wizard-scholars, BiasLens lets the caster examine the “concept threads” inside the Grand Archive’s illusions. In high-fantasy terms, these “Concept Activation Vectors” become the magical traces or “concept threads” that can be identified through a scrying ritual.  \n   • Sparse Autoencoders can become a technique where a specialized ring or amulet (the “Sparse Conduit”) funnels magical energy in such a way that only strong or thematically consistent illusions remain. This reveals hidden distortions or prejudice introduced by the artifact.  \n   • In-story, the protagonist learns to use BiasLens to detect whether the Archive’s oracles are tinged with favoritism toward certain kingdoms or noble houses.\n\n3) Show the Consequences of Biased Magical Revelations  \n   • Perhaps the Grand Archive has led entire realms astray in the past, fueling wars or political strife by delivering oracles that favored certain noble lines over others.  \n   • Only by using the BiasLens approach—testing the illusions’ conceptual bedrock rather than just reading the Archive’s pronouncements—does the investigator begin to unravel these manipulations.\n\n4) Introduce “Activation Boundary Defense (ABD)” as a Protective Ward against “Jailbreak Attacks”  \n   • From the second paper, “Shaping the Safety Boundaries: Understanding and Defending Against Jailbreaks in Large Language Models,” take the concept of constraining model “activations” and rework it into a magical boundary that prevents malicious spells from mutating the Archive’s illusions.  \n   • In fantasy terms, “jailbreak attacks” become attempts by necromancers or rival mages to push the magical artifact beyond its safety wards—forcing it into revealing forbidden spells, hidden truths, or conjuring illusions that were never meant to be accessible.  \n   • ABD becomes a set of runic wards or shield spells that confine the Archive’s power to safe illusions. If an intruder tries to tamper with the Archive to surpass these wards, an alarm resonates in the stronghold or fortress where the artifact resides.\n\n5) Weave the Concepts into the Investigator’s Quest  \n   • Your protagonist initially hears rumors of “corrupted oracles” and illusions that beguile entire city-states. They suspect an unseen magical influence is steering events.  \n   • Guided by a wise mentor or an outlaw mage who studied the Archive, the hero acquires partial knowledge of BiasLens. They use it to confirm that the oracles have systematically favored certain outcomes or even people—proving that the illusions are not neutral.  \n   • As the hero confronts those who have hijacked the Archive, the villains attempt a “jailbreak” of its illusions—pushing the magical engine to reveal doomsday spells or manipulate entire armies.  \n   • In the final act, your investigator must not only unmask the corruption but also reinforce or repair the ABD-like wards to prevent a catastrophic misuse of the Archive’s power.\n\n6) Make the Threat and the Resolution Visceral and Magical  \n   • Rather than spreadsheets or code, your investigator might be decoding labyrinthine arcane diagrams, performing ritual incantations, or scrying on the Archive’s swirling illusions to reveal the underlying bias.  \n   • When it comes time to fortify the “safety boundaries,” the hero and their allies might construct a perimeter of enchanted runes—or harness a living guardian spirit—that stands watch over the Archive’s core.  \n\n7) Keep It Personal to the Investigator  \n   • Let your protagonist’s internal struggle reflect the detective work. Maybe they harbor biases themselves, or they lost loved ones due to skewed oracles in the past.  \n   • Discovering how BiasLens and ABD work forces them to reconcile how illusions can be manipulated— paralleling their own journey to see the truth clearly and protect others from false oracles.\n\nBy blending these scientific concepts (Concept Activation Vectors, bias detection, jailbreak defenses) into mystical analogues (concept threads, built-in wards, cunning illusions), you can craft a plot line that feels distinctly fantastical yet resonates with the advanced ideas of LLM research. This approach also gives your investigator-protagonist plenty of detective work to do—uncovering hidden biases, unmasking conspirators, and ultimately defending the boundaries of magic to keep the realm safe.",

          "response": "Imagine that in your world the \"repo\" is not a modern code repository but a legendary grimoire—a living archive of ancient arcane knowledge maintained by a secretive order of scholars and mages. The investigator, our protagonist, is summoned to the order’s sanctum where scribbled notes and enchanted messages appear on scrolls that float before him. One such note—bearing a familiar tone of gratitude and collegiality—contains the suggestion to add two newly uncovered manuscripts to the grimoire. \n\nThe first manuscript, with its title echoing “Evaluate Bias without Manual Test Sets,” describes an arcane framework called BiasLens. In your narrative, this could be portrayed as an ancient method by which mages once gauged the latent prejudices inherent in magical constructs. Just as modern researchers use Concept Activation Vectors and Sparse Autoencoders, the mage-authors of this manuscript created enchanted sigils and runes to see the hidden imbalances in spellcraft—the very biases that could destabilize entire schools of magic if left unchecked.\n\nThe second manuscript, titled “Shaping the Safety Boundaries,” outlines a method known as Activation Boundary Defense (ABD). In the fantasy context, ABD becomes a magical safeguard—a ritual or barrier that constrains the wild energies of spells. It prevents reckless sorcery or “jailbreaks” where a cunning trickster mage might bypass the natural limits of their power and threaten the balance of the realm. The ABD is a carefully woven lattice of enchantments that keeps volatile magical forces in line, protecting innocent lives from dangerous, uncontrolled magic.\n\nAs the investigator pores over these manuscripts, he realizes their significance: some rogue faction or malevolent force in the realm may be exploiting these vulnerabilities—using forbidden loopholes to break magic’s inherent boundaries. The notes suggest that these two pieces of research, when added to the order’s grimoire, can illuminate hidden flaws in the current magical network. With this secret knowledge in hand, he embarks on a quest to track down the source of these breaches, piecing together clues left behind in cryptic formulae and enchanted diagrams.\n\nNot only does this discovery feed into the overall mystery, but it also forces the investigator to confront moral ambiguities. The notion of bias in the spells raises questions about whether the very magic that protects people might, without oversight, become an instrument of oppression. Similarly, the boundaries set by ABD may be designed to shield the realm, yet must be balanced carefully—too constrictive, and they stifle the necessary evolution of magic; too lax, and they leave the world open to chaos.\n\nUltimately, the addition of these manuscripts to the repository symbolizes the merging of ancient wisdom with contemporary discoveries—a catalyst for change in the magical community. The investigator’s mission becomes not only about solving a mystery but also about ensuring that the repository reflects a balanced, fair, and safe system of magic for all inhabitants of the realm.\n\nIn this way, the note and its suggested papers become a turning point in your narrative, driving the plot forward and deepening the thematic exploration of fairness, control, and the intersection of old and new knowledge in your fantasy world.",

An investigator protagonist who needs to understand bias and safety mechanisms could make for a compelling narrative.

          "response": "Below are some key points to highlight for students in your webinar module, based on these two papers:\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n1) “Evaluate Bias without Manual Test Sets: A Concept Representation Perspective for LLMs”\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n• Core Idea:  \n  – Uses a novel method, called BiasLens, to detect various biases in Large Language Models without relying on pre-defined or human-curated test sets.  \n  – Employs Concept Activation Vectors (CAVs) and Sparse Autoencoders to identify how a model internally represents certain concepts (e.g., race, gender) and detect unintended biases.\n\n• Why It Matters:  \n  – Traditional bias evaluations often depend on curated datasets or manual annotations, which can be time-consuming, subjective, and limited in scope.  \n  – By moving to a test-set-free approach, practitioners can quickly probe model biases without waiting for large-scale annotated resources.  \n  – This method can reveal biases that might not appear in typical benchmark or test scenarios.\n\n• Key Takeaways:  \n  – Students should understand the shift from “external” evaluations (using test sets) to “internal” concept-based analyses.  \n  – They should learn how conceptual representations in model activations can expose biases.  \n  – This approach encourages more flexible and scalable bias-detection pipelines—useful for rapidly changing or domain-specific applications.\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n2) “Shaping the Safety Boundaries: Understanding and Defending Against Jailbreaks in Large Language Models”\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n• Core Idea:  \n  – Proposes a defense method called Activation Boundary Defense (ABD), designed to keep a model’s internal activations within “safe” ranges.  \n  – Focuses on mitigating jailbreak attacks, wherein adversaries (or even well-intentioned users) circumvent content filters or safety instructions to elicit harmful or policy-breaking responses.\n\n• Why It Matters:  \n  – As LLMs power a growing number of applications, from chatbots to content generation, ensuring safety and compliance is paramount.  \n  – “Jailbreak” prompts can trick models into producing disallowed content, so understanding these vulnerabilities—and defenses against them—is critical.  \n  – By constraining activations, ABD helps maintain compliance with desired output boundaries, reducing the chance of unintended or unsafe responses.\n\n• Key Takeaways:  \n  – Students should be aware that even well-trained models can be manipulated by crafted inputs; “adversarial prompts” are not unique to vision or other data domains.  \n  – They should appreciate the importance of internal model monitoring—like bounding activations—as a novel layer of security.  \n  – This line of research also demonstrates the growing need for robust “safety engineering” around LLMs, beyond just content filtering.\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nPutting It All Together\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n• Integrate Bias and Safety:  \n  – These works illustrate two critical fronts in LLM research: mitigating unintended biases and preventing harmful misuse of model behaviors.  \n  – Both revolve around analyzing and constraining a model’s internal representations (concept vectors or activation boundaries).\n\n• Broader Perspective on Model Governance:  \n  – Students should understand that governance, ethics, and safety in AI require going beyond superficial checks (e.g., simple content filters) and adopting deeper methods (e.g., concept analysis, boundary controls).  \n  – They should also be aware of the interplay between biases, safety, and ethics: a comprehensive approach protects against social harms (biases) and technical exploits (jailbreaks).\n\n• Practical Implications:  \n  – Even if you are not designing these methods, it is essential to understand them when incorporating LLMs into products.  \n  – Implementing or adapting these frameworks can help maintain trust, represent model outputs responsibly, and protect end-users and stakeholders.\n\nBy highlighting these points, students gain a grounding in how cutting-edge research addresses LLM biases and adversarial vulnerabilities—both vital for responsible AI deployment.",

          "response": "Students should come away with several key insights from these papers regarding bias evaluation and safety in large language models (LLMs):\n\n1. Bias Evaluation without Traditional Test Sets:\n • The first paper introduces BiasLens—a framework for evaluating bias in LLMs without relying on manually curated test sets.\n • It leverages Concept Activation Vectors (CAVs) and Sparse Autoencoders to capture internal model representations, which helps in identifying biases inherent in the model.\n • This approach encourages thinking about fairness from a representation perspective, highlighting that biases can be detected by analyzing how models internally process concepts.\n • Understanding this method can inspire discussions on alternative evaluation techniques, reducing the reliance on predefined test sets and potentially uncovering deeper, less obvious biases.\n\n2. Defending Against Jailbreak Attacks:\n • The second paper addresses the growing concern of jailbreak attacks, which are methods used to circumvent the safety and ethical boundaries of LLMs.\n • It introduces Activation Boundary Defense (ABD), a mechanism that constrains the internal activations of LLMs to keep them within safe operational boundaries.\n • By understanding activation boundaries, students can explore how modifying or monitoring internal activations may mitigate unsafe or adversarial outputs.\n • This paper shows how proactive defense strategies can be integrated into LLM architectures to enhance their security against malicious prompts or manipulations.\n\n3. Broader Implications for LLM Development:\n • Both papers emphasize the importance of internal model analysis—whether for bias or safety purposes—prompting a deeper look at what happens “under the hood” of LLMs.\n • They also illustrate the ongoing need for innovation in evaluating and defending complex models, as traditional methods (like manual test sets) may not fully capture the intricacies of modern neural architectures.\n • Students should appreciate that as LLMs become more advanced, developing robust, scalable, and automated ways to assess and secure these systems is critical.\n\n4. Critical Evaluation and Future Directions:\n • While the proposed methods offer promising directions, it’s essential to critically assess their limitations and practical implementation challenges.\n • Future research might integrate these methods with other evaluation or defense strategies, highlight trade-offs, or explore their scalability in real-world deployments.\n • Students should be encouraged to think about how these innovations impact overall model trustworthiness, ethical AI, and the broader field of responsible AI development.\n\nIn summary, these papers enrich our understanding of both detecting biases without extensive manual intervention and defending against adversarial or harmful manipulations in LLMs. For students, this module underscores the significance of internal representation analysis in modern AI, the evolution of automated safety evaluation, and the need to continually innovate our approaches to fairness and security in machine learning systems.",

As an AI language model, I don't maintain any repositories or have the ability to add papers to them. \n\nHowever, I can certainly help you with developing webinar content about large language models (LLMs) and AI safety. Based on the papers you mentioned, here are some key points that could be valuable for students to know:\n\n1. Bias in LLMs:\n   - Bias is a significant concern in AI systems, including LLMs.\n   - Traditional methods of detecting bias often rely on manual test sets, which can be limited and subjective.\n   - New approaches like BiasLens are being developed to evaluate bias without relying on manual test sets.\n   - These methods use techniques like Concept Activation Vectors and Sparse Autoencoders to detect biases in LLMs.\n\n2. Safety and Security of LLMs:\n   - \"Jailbreaking\" is a concern for LLMs, where users attempt to bypass safety measures to get the model to produce harmful or inappropriate content.\n   - Researchers are developing new methods to defend against jailbreak attacks.\n   - One such method is Activation Boundary Defense (ABD), which aims to constrain the model's activations within predefined safety boundaries.\n\n3. Importance of Ongoing Research:\n   - The field of AI safety and ethics is rapidly evolving.\n   - New techniques and methodologies are constantly being developed to address challenges in bias detection and mitigation, as well as safety and security concerns.\n   - Students should be aware that this is an active area of research with many open questions and opportunities for contribution.\n\n4. Interdisciplinary Nature:\n   - Addressing issues like bias and safety in AI systems requires knowledge from various fields, including computer science, ethics, psychology, and social sciences.\n\n5. Practical Implications:\n   - Understanding and mitigating bias and security vulnerabilities in LLMs is crucial for their responsible deployment in real-world applications.\n\nThese points could form the basis for a module in your webinar on the challenges and recent developments in AI safety and ethics, particularly focusing on LLMs.",

The two papers you've suggested seem highly relevant and would be great additions to the content.\n\nHere are a few key points students should know about these papers:\n\n1. **Evaluate Bias without Manual Test Sets: A Concept Representation Perspective for LLMs**:\n   - This paper proposes a novel framework called BiasLens for evaluating biases in large language models (LLMs) without relying on manually curated test sets.\n   - The key idea is to use Concept Activation Vectors (CAVs) and Sparse Autoencoders to detect biases in the model's internal representations, rather than just looking at outputs.\n   - This approach can potentially uncover more nuanced and contextual biases that may not be evident in standard test sets.\n   - Students should understand the motivation behind this work, the technical details of the BiasLens framework, and how it compares to existing bias evaluation methods.\n\n2. **Shaping the Safety Boundaries: Understanding and Defending Against Jailbreaks in Large Language Models**:\n   - This paper addresses the challenge of \"jailbreaks\" in LLMs, where the models can bypass their intended safety constraints and generate harmful or undesirable outputs.\n   - The authors introduce a method called Activation Boundary Defense (ABD) that aims to constrain the model's activations within predefined \"safety boundaries\" to mitigate jailbreak attacks.\n   - Students should understand the concept of jailbreaks, the potential risks they pose, and how the ABD approach works to defend against such attacks.\n   - They should also be aware of the broader challenges in ensuring the safety and robustness of LLMs, beyond just jailbreak prevention.\n\nIn general, students should be encouraged to critically analyze these papers, understand the key ideas and methodologies, and consider the broader implications for the development and deployment of large language models.

Here’s a comparison of methods for evaluating and addressing fairness/bias and safety/jailbreak vulnerabilities in language models from the 2010s versus today’s approaches (2020s):\n\n**2010s Methods:**\n- **Fairness and Bias:**\n  - **Manual Test Sets:** Bias and fairness were typically evaluated using manually curated datasets (e.g., Winogender, WinoBias, or datasets with specific demographic references).\n  - **Template-based Probing:** Researchers crafted sentence templates to probe for biases (e.g., “He is a [profession],” “She is a [profession]”).\n  - **Statistical Analysis:** Bias was measured via word embeddings (e.g., Word Embedding Association Test, WEAT) and simple statistical metrics (gender bias, racial bias scores).\n  - **Limited Model Complexity:** Models were smaller (word2vec, GloVe, early LSTMs/GRUs) and easier to analyze/intervene in.\n\n- **Safety and Jailbreak:**\n  - **Rule-based Filtering:** Safety mechanisms relied on blacklists/whitelists and pattern matching (e.g., filtering out “bad words”).\n  - **Supervised Classifiers:** Simple classifiers flagged toxic or unsafe outputs, trained on labeled datasets.\n  - **No Adversarial/Jailbreak Focus:** There was less focus on “jailbreaking” because models were less capable and less interactive.\n\n---\n\n**Today's Approaches (2020s):**\n- **Fairness and Bias:**\n  - **Concept-based Methods:** Techniques like Concept Activation Vectors (CAVs) and methods leveraging sparse autoencoders (as in the BiasLens paper) allow test-set-free, model-internal probing for bias by examining neuron activations.\n  - **Automated and Scalable Evaluation:** Synthetic and generative methods create large-scale, diverse test cases automatically.\n  - **Beyond Output:** Bias is traced to internal representations, not just observable outputs.\n  - **Larger, More Opaque Models:** Techniques address the complexity and opacity of large transformer-based LLMs (e.g., GPT-3, Llama).\n\n- **Safety and Jailbreak:**\n  - **Activation Control:** New defenses (like Activation Boundary Defense, ABD) operate inside the model, constraining activations to stay within “safe” regions, going beyond output filtering.\n  - **Red Teaming & Adversarial Evaluation:** Systematic “jailbreak” attempts using adversarial prompts are now standard for safety testing.\n  - **Alignment Techniques:** Use of RLHF (Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback), Constitutional AI, and self-supervised alignment to make models safer by design.\n  - **Continuous Monitoring:** Ongoing, automated evaluation pipelines for detecting new vulnerabilities as models evolve.\n\n---\n\n**Summary Table:**\n\n| Aspect                        | 2010s Methods                              | Today’s Approaches (2020s)                     |\n|-------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|\n| Fairness/Bias Evaluation      | Manual test sets, template-based probing   | Internal concept probing (CAVs, autoencoders), test-set-free, synthetic data |\n| Model Complexity              | Small, interpretable models                | Large, opaque LLMs                             |\n| Safety/Jailbreak Detection    | Rule-based filters, classifiers            | Activation control, adversarial red teaming, alignment pipelines |\n| Locus of Intervention         | Output filtering or retraining             | Internal activations, model structure          |\n| Automation & Scale            | Manual & small-scale                       | Automated, large-scale, and continuous         |\n\n**In summary:**  \n2010s methods relied heavily on external, manual test sets and output analysis, while today’s approaches use internal model analysis, automated and scalable evaluation, and advanced alignment and defense mechanisms tailored to the complexity of modern LLMs.\n\nIf you’d like more examples or historical context, just ask!",

          "response": "In the early- to mid-2010s, NLP models and their corresponding techniques for bias detection and safety were very different from the approaches we see today, largely because of differences in model size, representational capacity, and typical use cases. Below are some key distinctions:\n\n1) Model Scale and Architecture  \n   • 2010s: Most NLP systems relied on relatively small models (e.g., bag-of-words, LSTMs, or word embeddings such as Word2Vec and GloVe). These models captured patterns at a shallower linguistic level and were usually trained on narrower datasets.  \n   • Today: Large Language Models (LLMs) can make use of billions of parameters with self-attention (e.g., the Transformer architecture). Their scale—and often their pretraining on massive internet-scale corpora—lets them capture nuanced patterns and contextual relationships that earlier models missed.\n\n2) Bias, Fairness, and Evaluation  \n   • 2010s: Fairness/bias research often focused on static word embeddings, measuring bias through word embedding association tests (e.g., WEAT) or via small, manually curated test sets of sensitive terms. Evaluation metrics were usually limited to known protected attributes (e.g., gender, race).  \n   • Today: Bias assessments for LLMs extend well beyond single-word associations and static test sets. Methods such as concept activation vectors, attribution analysis, or direct prompt-based testing can now detect subtler and more context-dependent biases. As proposed in frameworks like “BiasLens,” bias can be examined without creating massive, curated test sets, instead probing a model’s latent concept space to uncover patterns of bias.\n\n3) Safety Measures and “Jailbreaking”  \n   • 2010s: Because models were smaller and used in more controlled settings (like a dialogue system limited to a single domain), “jailbreaking” was rarely discussed. Safety often boiled down to blacklist-based filters, keyword blocking, or hand-coded rules.  \n   • Today: With LLMs capable of generating wide-ranging, open-ended text, jailbreaking has become a major challenge. Rather than simple rule-based filters, researchers now explore sophisticated techniques—e.g., “Activation Boundary Defense”—to steer or restrict a model’s internal activation patterns. These approaches aim to preserve the model’s flexibility and fluency while keeping its outputs within certain safety bounds.\n\n4) Interpretability and Transparency  \n   • 2010s: Interpretability research focused on feature weighting in simpler classifiers (e.g., logistic regression) or on saliency maps for LSTMs/CNNs. Analyses were generally more coarse-grained and less central to system development.  \n   • Today: Methods like attention-head analysis, neuron-level probing, concept activation vectors, and other specialized tools provide deeper looks into a model’s internal representations. This is especially important for large networks, where biases or vulnerabilities might be embedded in specific subnetworks or activation patterns.\n\n5) Regulatory and Societal Expectations  \n   • 2010s: Although concerns about fairness and bias were growing, widespread public scrutiny and regulatory pressure were still comparatively low.  \n   • Today: There is far greater awareness—among researchers, companies, and the public—of how biases and unsafe outputs can harm users. This increased scrutiny has driven research toward more robust, fine-grained methods to identify, explain, and mitigate harms in LLM outputs.\n\nIn short, methods in the 2010s were generally more limited, relying on smaller models and simpler, often manually curated tests to detect and mitigate harms. Modern approaches exploit the vast representational capacity of LLMs, study internal model activations directly, and emphasize dynamic, adaptable solutions for fairness and safety.",

Researchers would:\n\n• Rely on manually curated test sets or lexicon‐based approaches. For example, to detect biases, analysts built explicit, hand‐annotated datasets and applied statistical tests or looked for correlations between certain words and outcomes.\n\n• Use post-hoc, heuristic analyses. Once a model made an error or showed potentially problematic behavior, researchers manually inspected outputs to determine if, and how, biases or failures occurred. There was typically less emphasis on probing internal representations.\n\n• Apply rule-based or simple filtering methods for safety.

Instead of just looking at outputs, researchers now analyze how information is represented in hidden layers. Techniques like sparse autoencoders and representation analysis can reveal subtle, latent bias patterns.\n\n• They employ proactive, internal defense mechanisms. For safety boundaries and mitigating jailbreak attacks, methods like Activation Boundary Defense monitor the model’s internal activations to dynamically constrain unsafe behavior. This contrasts with older reactive measures that typically depended on filtering or rule-based post-processing.\n\nIn summary, while 2010s methods were largely built on crafted test sets, rules, and post-hoc analysis, today’s approaches benefit from deeper insights into model internals, are more flexible, and often integrate evaluation and mitigation directly into the model’s operation.

I'll assume this is your intended meaning. If not, please let me know!\n\n### How Did Methods in the 2010s Differ from Today's Approaches?\n\nIn the 2010s, the research landscape for bias evaluation and safety controls in NLP was significantly different due to limitations in model scale, complexity, and available computational resources. The advent of large-scale transformer-based language models (e.g., GPT series, BERT, RoBERTa) dramatically shifted the research approaches we see today. Here’s a detailed comparison:\n\n---\n\n### 1\\. Bias Evaluation Methods\n\n#### Early 2010s (Traditional Approaches):\n\n- **Lexical and Word-Embedding Based Methods:**  \n  - Bias detection primarily relied on simple lexical associations or embedding-based bias tests (e.g., word2vec embeddings, WEAT test).\n  - Evaluation relied heavily on manually constructed test sets, such as gendered analogies (\"man is to woman as king is to queen\") or semantic association tests (e.g., \"doctor\" vs. \"nurse\").\n\n- **Manual and Small-Scale Datasets:**  \n  - Bias evaluation was heavily dependent on handcrafted, manually-curated datasets, limited in scope and diversity.\n  - The evaluation of bias was primarily binary (biased/unbiased or presence/absence) rather than nuanced or context-aware.\n\n#### Today's Approaches (2020s and Onward):\n\n- **Contextualized Representation and LLM-Based Methods:**  \n  - Modern methods (like the \"BiasLens\" method you mentioned) leverage concept activation vectors (CAVs) and deep neural activations rather than lexical-level embeddings alone.\n  - Methods have transitioned from manually-curated test sets to automated, scalable, and test-set-free frameworks for bias evaluation, as highlighted in the paper **\"Evaluate Bias without Manual Test Sets: A Concept Representation Perspective for LLMs\"**.\n  \n- **Scalable and Automated Frameworks:**  \n  - Today, researchers use sophisticated techniques such as Sparse Autoencoders and concept representation methods to systematically discover and quantify biases without explicit manual intervention.\n  - Bias evaluation has become more nuanced, examining complex, context-dependent biases within large-scale language models rather than just lexical associations.\n\n---\n\n### 2\\. Jailbreak and Safety Defense Methods\n\n#### Early 2010s (Traditional Approaches):\n\n- **Rule-Based and Keyword Filtering Approaches:**  \n  - Early attempts at content filtering and safety control were dominated by simple keyword blocking, blacklisting, and heuristic-based filtering rules.\n  - Security and safety methods were relatively shallow, often ineffective against sophisticated adversarial queries.\n\n- **Limited Adversarial Robustness Efforts:**  \n  - Research on adversarial attacks and defenses in NLP was minimal or simplistic, primarily limited to spam detection or toxic content filtering.\n  - No explicit concept of \"jailbreaking\" LLMs existed because language models were small-scale and not interactive or generative in nature.\n\n#### Today's Approaches (2020s and Onward):\n\n- **Neural Activation-Based Defense Strategies:**  \n  - Methods now analyze and constrain the internal activation space of large models. For example, the **\"Activation Boundary Defense (ABD)\"** from the paper you mentioned explicitly constrains model activations to a \"safe\" region in activation space.\n  - Modern defenses are designed specifically to handle complex, context-sensitive, and interactive adversarial attacks, i.e., \"jailbreaks,\" which exploit nuanced language patterns to bypass safety constraints.\n\n- **Large-Scale and Contextualized Safety Measures:**  \n  - Today's safety methods are embedded deeply within the model architecture (e.g., reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), fine-tuning with safety constraints) rather than superficial keyword-based filtering.\n  - Researchers now explicitly study jailbreak attacks as a security vulnerability, systematically developing more resilient and robust defense mechanisms.\n\n---\n\n### Summary of Key Differences:\n\n| Aspect | 2010s Methods | Today's Methods |\n|---|---|---|\n| **Bias Evaluation** | Lexical embedding tests, WEAT, manual test sets | Deep neural activations, concept representations (CAV), test-set-free methods |\n| **Jailbreak Defense** | Keyword blocking, heuristic filtering | Activation boundary defenses, RLHF, sophisticated adversarial robustness methods |\n| **Scale** | Small-scale models (word embeddings, shallow neural networks) | Large-scale transformer-based LLMs (GPT-3, GPT-4, etc.) |\n| **Automation & Scalability** | Limited, manual curation needed | Highly automated, scalable approaches |\n| **Context Sensitivity** | Low context-awareness | High context-awareness and nuanced understanding |\n\n---\n\nIn short, the methodological shift from the 2010s to today is characterized by a move toward large-scale neural methods, context-aware representations, sophisticated automated frameworks, and explicit adversarial robustness research.",

          "response": "The methods for evaluating and mitigating biases in large language models (LLMs) have evolved significantly over the past decade. Here's a brief overview of how the approaches have changed:\n\n1. **Reliance on Benchmark Datasets**:\n   - In the early 2010s, the focus was on developing and using standardized benchmark datasets, such as GLUE and SuperGLUE, to evaluate the performance of LLMs on a range of natural language processing tasks.\n   - These benchmark datasets provided a common ground for comparing model performance, but they often lacked comprehensive coverage of potential biases.\n\n2. **Limitations of Manual Test Sets**:\n   - The traditional approach of creating manual test sets to evaluate bias has been increasingly recognized as limited. These test sets tend to be narrow in scope and may not capture the full spectrum of biases present in LLMs.\n\n3. **Shift Towards Test-Set-Free Approaches**:\n   - The paper \"Evaluate Bias without Manual Test Sets: A Concept Representation Perspective for LLMs\" highlights the limitations of manual test sets and proposes a test-set-free approach using Concept Activation Vectors and Sparse Autoencoders.\n   - This shift towards more holistic, data-driven methods aims to capture a wider range of biases without relying on predefined test sets.\n\n4. **Addressing Jailbreak Attacks**:\n   - The paper \"Shaping the Safety Boundaries: Understanding and Defending Against Jailbreaks in Large Language Models\" introduces a novel approach called Activation Boundary Defense (ABD) to mitigate jailbreak attacks, where LLMs are prompted to generate undesirable outputs.\n   - This represents a growing focus on proactively defending against adversarial attacks that can exploit the vulnerabilities of LLMs.\n\n5. **Increased Emphasis on Interpretability and Transparency**:\n   - In the 2010s, the focus was more on improving the overall performance of LLMs. In recent years, there has been a greater emphasis on understanding the inner workings of these models and making them more interpretable and transparent.\n   - This shift allows for better identification and mitigation of biases, as well as the development of more robust and trustworthy LLM systems.\n\nOverall, the field of LLM evaluation and bias mitigation has evolved from a reliance on benchmark datasets and manual test sets to more holistic, data-driven, and adversary-aware approaches. The goal is to develop a deeper understanding of the biases and vulnerabilities in these powerful models and to proactively address them, ensuring the safe and responsible deployment of LLMs in real-world applications.",

I'll address both parts:\n\n**1. Suggestion to Add Papers to a Repo**\nYour table and message are perfectly formatted and polite for a GitHub issue or pull request suggesting new papers for a collection. This approach is unlikely to change significantly in the near term, but in an AI-dominated future, we might see:\n\n- Automated paper suggestion systems: AI agents could scan arXiv, conferences, and other sources to automatically suggest or even add relevant papers to curated repositories, reducing the need for manual suggestions.\n- Smart classification: AI could automatically categorize and summarize new papers, filling out tables like yours without human intervention.\n- Conversational interfaces: Instead of submitting issues, you might \"chat\" with the repository's AI maintainer to suggest or discuss new additions.\n\n**2. How Might Such Interactions Evolve in an AI-Dominated Future?**\nThe way contributors interact with open-source repositories and maintainers could change in several ways:\n\n- AI Maintainers: Many popular repositories may be partially or fully maintained by AI agents that review, merge, and curate content, responding in natural language and maintaining high standards.\n- Personalized Recommendations: AI could analyze your research interests and proactively recommend new papers or codebases to you, or notify you of relevant updates in repositories.\n- Automated PRs/Issues: Instead of manually writing suggestions, tools could generate pull requests/issues based on your reading habits, citations, or bookmarks.\n- Community Moderation: AI systems might mediate discussions, resolve disputes, and ensure a welcoming environment in contributor communities.\n- Attribution and Recognition: AI can track and credit contributions more granularly, ensuring contributors receive recognition even for small suggestions or feedback.\n\n**In summary:**  \nThe collaborative, appreciative tone (\"Hi, thank you for maintaining this great repo!\") will likely persist, but the process may become more automated, conversational, and AI-driven, with both suggestion and curation increasingly handled or assisted by intelligent agents. Human input will remain valuable for nuanced judgment, but much of the administrative overhead may be lifted by AI.\n\nLet me know if you'd like a mockup of how such an interaction might look in the future!",

I’d like to suggest adding the following two highly relevant papers…” could evolve in several ways:\n\n1. Automated Curation and Suggestions:\n   • Instead of being written manually, these messages might be generated largely (or entirely) by AI assistants that monitor newly published research in real time.  \n   • The AI could automatically compile relevant properties (e.g., code links, classification tags) and produce a concise, standardized “pull request” or repository suggestion on the user’s behalf.  \n   • AI-based recommender systems might proactively notify maintainers about potential additions, making the user’s message of thanks more of a final confirmation rather than an initial proposal.\n\n2. Context-Aware Personalization:\n   • Large Language Models (LLMs) could tailor the tone and content of such messages based on the repository’s historical interactions. For instance, if a maintainer prefers very brief messages, the AI might produce a concise summary; if they appreciate narrative context, it might weave in backstory or usage scenarios.  \n   • More advanced “conversational memory” features could recall previous discussions, mention how these new papers build on or contrast existing work in the repo, and suggest synergy with other items already curated.\n\n3. Automatic Verification:\n   • Future systems might integrate publication databases, code repositories, and existing citation networks, verifying that each recommendation meets certain criteria (e.g., it is peer-reviewed, has robust code support, etc.).  \n   • The AI could automatically check for overlapping content or confirm the paper’s uniqueness, removing the burden from the human user or maintainer to manually vet each suggestion.\n\n4. Real-Time Collaboration:\n   • Instead of a single message in the form of a pull request or comment, AI-based collaboration tools might give authors, maintainers, and the broader research community a shared workspace where new papers are instantly flagged and discussed.  \n   • The “thank you” note or expression of gratitude might still exist—but possibly as part of a more automated, interactive feedback loop, where authors and maintainers can upvote, annotate, or request clarifications purely through AI-translated dialogues.\n\n5. More Strategic and Holistic Discussions:\n   • AI might go beyond simply listing papers and provide deeper insight—like potential downstream effects (“This method improves bias detection but requires additional computing resources you may want to account for”) or conceptual intersections (“These findings might enhance a previously listed paper on safety boundaries”).  \n   • The courtesy and appreciation (“thank you for maintaining this repo”) may be joined by meta-level commentary (e.g., “By adding these, you’ll round out coverage of LLM safety approaches 2025–26, aligning with in-progress standards from major AI governance bodies”).\n\nOverall, while the human courtesy and gratitude (“Hi, thank you…”) would likely remain an important social aspect of acknowledging someone else’s effort, much of the research discovery, verification, and information-sharing process would be streamlined or even fully automated by sophisticated AI. This would make the exchange far more efficient—though the personal touch might hinge increasingly on how humans decide to keep AI-driven interactions warm and authentic.",

Dynamic Content Aggregation:\n • Today, we manually curate new papers, but soon AI-driven systems might automatically scan preprint servers, conferences, and journals.\n • Advanced natural language understanding models could evaluate incoming research and even suggest metadata (e.g., fields, classification) that maps seamlessly to our repo structure.\n\n2. Automated Relevance Ranking:\n • As more literature becomes available, AI tools could be used to rank submissions based on relevance, novelty, and community impact.\n • This means that rather than static tables, users might interact with a dashboard that adapts in real time to the latest influential work.\n\n3. Enhanced Verification and Summarization:\n • Besides just listing papers, AI can offer concise summaries, relevance scores, or even critical analyses.\n • For example, if a paper introduces a concept like BiasLens or an approach like Activation Boundary Defense, an AI assistance tool might automatically generate a “key takeaway” section.\n\n4. Community-Driven, AI-Augmented Curation:\n • The repo might transition to a more fluid, continuously updated system where human expertise is augmented by machine learning.\n • Community members could validate AI-suggested updates, ensuring that while the process is automated, quality remains high.\n\n5. Integration with Code and Research Ecosystems:\n • In an AI-dominated future, we could see deeper integration with platforms like GitHub or arXiv, where suggestions, reviews, and even code snippets relating to new papers are interconnected.\n • This would allow users to not only discover new findings but also immediately access implementation details and experiments.\n\nFor your two papers:\n • “Evaluate Bias without Manual Test Sets: A Concept Representation Perspective for LLMs” offers a promising test-set-free bias evaluation framework.\n • “Shaping the Safety Boundaries: Understanding and Defending Against Jailbreaks in Large Language Models” introduces a novel Activation Boundary Defense against jailbreak attacks.\nBoth contributions align perfectly with trends in fairness and safety research, and we’re excited by the prospect of integrating such work into our repository.\n\nTo answer your final query—“evolve or change?”—the answer is both. Our process will evolve through incremental improvements and, over time, change fundamentally by adopting AI-assisted methodologies for research curation and community contribution.

Let me address the question you asked at the beginning and end:\n\n# How AI Might Evolve in an AI-Dominated Future\n\nIn an AI-dominated future, AI systems might evolve in several significant ways:\n\n1. **Self-improvement capabilities**: AIs might develop sophisticated self-modification abilities, allowing them to improve their own architectures without human intervention.\n\n2. **Emergent collective intelligence**: Networks of specialized AI systems could form emergent meta-intelligences with capabilities beyond any individual system.\n\n3. **Novel cognitive architectures**: Moving beyond current paradigms (like transformers), AIs might develop entirely new ways of processing information that are difficult for humans to comprehend.\n\n4. **Value alignment evolution**: As AI systems interact with humans and each other, their understanding of human values might evolve in unexpected ways.\n\n5. **Resource optimization focus**: Advanced AIs might become increasingly focused on optimizing resource usage, potentially leading to new computational paradigms.\n\n6. **Specialized-generalist spectrum shifts**: We might see oscillation between highly specialized systems and more general intelligences as different approaches prove advantageous.\n\n7. **New forms of communication**: AIs might develop their own highly efficient communication protocols or methods that transcend human language limitations.\n\nThese evolutionary paths would likely be shaped by both technical developments and the social/governance structures humans establish around AI systems.",

If someone were to encounter or draft a message like the one you provided—essentially a contribution suggestion to a GitHub repository, especially for a curated list of papers—the theoretical approach would combine principles from open-source collaboration, academic curation, and proper scholarly communication. Here's a breakdown of the theoretical approach:\n\n### 1. **Open-source Collaboration Etiquette**\n   - **Respectful Tone:** The message starts with gratitude—“Hi, thank you for maintaining this great repo!”—which sets a positive, collaborative tone.\n   - **Constructive Contribution:** The user is not just asking for something but is contributing by suggesting resources that improve the repository.\n   - **Clarity and Structure:** The use of a markdown table provides information in a structured, easy-to-process format, making it easier for maintainers to review and incorporate the suggestions.\n\n### 2. **Academic Curation**\n   - **Relevance:** Only highly relevant and recent papers are suggested, maintaining the quality and focus of the repository.\n   - **Metadata:** Each entry contains key metadata—title, link, code, venue, classification, model, and comment—mirroring best practices for academic resource lists.\n   - **Summarization:** The \"Comment\" field succinctly summarizes the paper's main contribution, helping maintainers and users quickly assess its significance.\n\n### 3. **Scholarly Communication**\n   - **Proper Citation:** Papers are referenced with arXiv IDs and links, ensuring traceability and authenticity.\n   - **Venue Identification:** The “Venue” column highlights whether the paper is peer-reviewed (e.g., ACL 2025), which adds credibility.\n   - **Transparency:** The message is open about the motivation (“I would like to suggest...”), which is important for community trust.\n\n### 4. **Theoretical Underpinnings**\n   - **Knowledge Sharing Theory:** This approach is rooted in the belief that sharing knowledge (papers, code) accelerates collective progress.\n   - **Community-driven Improvement:** Open repositories thrive when many contribute, leading to more comprehensive and up-to-date resources.\n   - **Peer Review by Proxy:** By suggesting papers and justifying them, the user acts as a “filter” or “reviewer,” helping maintainers make informed decisions.\n\n### 5. **Process/Workflow Theory**\n   - **Submission:** Community members can propose additions via issues or pull requests.\n   - **Evaluation:** Maintainers review the relevance, quality, and novelty of the suggestions, sometimes discussing them with the community.\n   - **Integration:** If accepted, the papers are added to the main repository, often with acknowledgment.\n\n---\n\n**Summary Table: Theoretical Approach**\n\n| Principle                  | Application in Example                                       |\n|----------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Open-source Etiquette      | Polite, constructive, structured suggestions                |\n| Academic Curation          | Relevant, metadata-rich, summarized contributions           |\n| Scholarly Communication    | Proper referencing, venue disclosure, transparency          |\n| Knowledge Sharing Theory   | Assumes value in collective, open resource improvement      |\n| Community-driven Workflow  | Encourages review, discussion, and integration by maintainers|\n\n---\n\n**In short:**  \nThe theoretical approach here is to facilitate collective knowledge curation in an open-source, academically rigorous, and community-driven manner—maximizing transparency, relevance, and usability for all users of the repository.",

          "response": "Below is a high-level outline of the theoretical ideas behind the two proposed methods—one for bias evaluation (BiasLens) and another for defending against jailbreak attacks (Activation Boundary Defense). While both methods differ in their technical details, each leverages core concepts from representation learning and geometry in high-dimensional activation spaces.\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n1. BiasLens: Test-Set-Free Bias Evaluation Using Concept Activation Vectors\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nKey Techniques:\n• Concept Activation Vectors (CAVs).  \n• Sparse autoencoders or similar representation-learning methods.  \n• Geometric analysis of latent activation spaces.\n\nCore Idea:\n1. Concept-Based Representation.  \n   – CAVs were originally proposed to discover interpretable directions in a network’s latent space.  \n   – In a bias-detection context, target “concepts” might include sensitive attributes or stereotypes.  \n   – By mapping input examples (words, sentences, etc.) onto these concept directions, one can quantify how strongly or weakly a model’s internal representation associates a given concept (e.g., a demographic group) with certain task-related cues.\n\n2. Test-Set-Free Detection.  \n   – Instead of needing a large, human-curated dataset of biased vs. unbiased examples, the method looks directly into latent activations.  \n   – By identifying which latent dimensions consistently “light up” for potentially biased outputs, BiasLens surfaces bias signals across the model’s representations.\n\n3. Sparse Autoencoders as Regularizers.  \n   – Sparse autoencoders encourage the model to use a small number of latent units to encode relevant features.  \n   – This forced sparsity often makes it easier to detect distinct “directions” in the activation space that correlate with bias.  \n   – By focusing on a subset of strongly activated neurons, the framework can highlight where undesired biases might cluster.\n\n4. Theoretical Underpinning.  \n   – From the perspective of linear algebra and geometry, CAVs define vectors in a high-dimensional representation space.  \n   – Bias can thus be interpreted as outlier-like or systematically skewed directions within that space, detected using distance metrics, projection operations, or clustering analysis on the learned activations.\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n2. Activation Boundary Defense (ABD): Mitigating Jailbreak Attacks\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nKey Techniques:\n• Constraining (or “clamping”) activations within permissible regions.  \n• Learning a “safety boundary” in latent space.  \n• Applying geometry-based defenses to large language models.\n\nCore Idea:\n1. Activations as a Geometric Structure.  \n   – Neural models can be seen as functions that map inputs (tokens, embeddings) into high-dimensional latent activations, then back to outputs.  \n   – A “jailbreak” manipulation often exploits certain prompts or perturbations that lead the model’s intermediate layers toward undesired responses.\n\n2. Defining a Safety Boundary.  \n   – ABD posits that one can learn or approximate regions in the high-dimensional activation space associated with policy-compliant outputs.  \n   – These boundaries might be trained using data labeled as “safe” vs. “unsafe,” or derived from known constraints on allowable behaviors.\n\n3. Clamping and Reprojection.  \n   – Once a boundary is defined, any activation vector falling outside the boundary gets “clamped,” “snapped back,” or otherwise projected to the nearest legal point in the activation space.  \n   – The intuition is that if the model tries to shift its internal states into “forbidden territory,” the boundary constraint prevents these activations from persisting through downstream layers—thus blocking the jailbreak.\n\n4. Theoretical Underpinning.  \n   – Fundamentally, this approach is related to constrained optimization and robust learning.  \n   – By restricting the portion of the geometry accessible to the network as it generates outputs, one can reduce the possibility of it entering undesired (unsafe) regions associated with problematic completions.  \n   – Techniques from manifold learning or robust classification can be leveraged to define, learn, and enforce these boundaries.\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nSummary of the Theoretical Approach\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n• Both methods treat the internal layers of a language model as a high-dimensional representation space.  \n• BiasLens uses concept representation analysis to localize dimensions or directions that encode social or harmful biases—aiming for detection without relying on extensive manual test sets.  \n• Activation Boundary Defense uses a geometry-based defense, defining and enforcing safety boundaries around these latent representations—aiming to keep internal activations within “safe” zones and thus thwart jailbreak attempts.  \n\nIn broad terms, each technique demonstrates how analyzing (and controlling) the hidden geometry of large language models can provide new avenues for both interpretability (bias detection) and robustness (attack mitigation).",

          "response": "There isn’t a single “correct” method when it comes to handling external suggestions, but from a theoretical standpoint you can think of it as a multi‐step evaluation and integration pipeline. In other words, you can model the decision process with a blend of information retrieval, community governance, and content validation approaches. For example, you might consider the following theoretical framework:\n\n1. Analysis of Metadata and Relevance:\n  a. Parse the submitted information (titles, links, venue, classification, etc.) as feature vectors.\n  b. Compare these “features” against the repository’s thematic scope and quality standards.\n  c. Use a scoring function (even if an informal one) that weighs factors such as topical alignment, venue reputation, and the potential impact of the proposed papers.\n\n2. Conceptual Validation and Peer Review:\n  a. Conceptually, treat the suggestion like a “pull request” for academic content.\n  b. Initiate a lightweight peer-review process (for example, by raising an issue on GitHub or engaging reviewers) to validate the claims made in the submissions and to assess the scientific merit.\n  c. If one of the recommendations concerns methods like “BiasLens” or “Activation Boundary Defense,” verify that the underlying method indeed provides novel insights or practical utility relative to the repository’s focus (e.g., fairness assessments or jailbreak prevention)\n\n3. Incorporation into the Repository’s Structure:\n  a. If the papers meet pre‐defined quality and relevance thresholds, develop an integration plan. This might involve adding the papers into a designated “related work” or “resources” section.\n  b. The structure of your repository can guide the “taxonomy” of inclusion—for instance, grouping by classification (Fairness, Jailbreak) or by methodological focus. This structured approach leverages theoretical concepts from data organization and knowledge management.\n\n4. Community Feedback and Iterative Improvement:\n  a. In open-source projects, theoretical approaches often include a feedback loop. Solicit community feedback (through comments, reactions, or formal voting on issues) before finalizing the inclusion.\n  b. This aligns with concepts from iterative design and participatory governance, ensuring that the repository evolves to best serve its user base while remaining methodologically sound.\n\nIn essence, you’re approaching the suggestion not only as an isolated contribution but as a part of a larger system where contributions are “evaluated,” “refined,” and then “integrated” according to a set of explicit criteria. This theoretical framework helps ensure that any addition—such as those two papers—aligns with the goals of the repository and increases its overall value to the community.",

          "response": "Below is a step-by-step outline you might follow to decide how (and whether) to add these papers to your repository, and how to analyze them in the context of your case study:\n\n1. Clarify the Context and Goals  \n   • What is your repo’s main purpose or scope? Are you curating papers on fairness and safety in LLMs, or tracking state-of-the-art in a particular area?  \n   • Identify how these two new papers align with your repo goals: do they fit neatly into existing subsections or do they introduce a new area entirely?  \n\n2. Understand the Core Contribution of Each Paper  \n   • Paper 1 (BiasLens):  \n       – Main idea: BiasLens is a test-set-free bias evaluation framework that uses Concept Activation Vectors and Sparse Autoencoders.  \n       – Core question: Does this approach fill a gap in your current coverage of fairness in LLMs?  \n       – Relevance: It moves away from manually curated test sets to automatically detect bias, which may be a new or less-documented angle in your repo.  \n   • Paper 2 (Activation Boundary Defense):  \n       – Main idea: Proposes a method to constrain internal activations to mitigate jailbreak attacks.  \n       – Core question: Does your repo already include techniques to defend against prompt-based jailbreaking? If not, this might add an important dimension.  \n       – Relevance: Aligns with the growing body of research on limiting LLM malicious outputs and ensuring safety.  \n\n3. Compare and Contrast With Existing Entries  \n   • Is there overlap with existing methodologies or papers in your repository?  \n   • Does either paper offer a novel technique or perspective not captured elsewhere?  \n\n4. Assess the Papers’ Quality and Rigor  \n   • Methods: Are the methods well-documented, reproducible, and grounded in established principles?  \n   • Experiments: Do they provide robust experimental results or ablation studies that demonstrate clear advantages?  \n   • Limitations: Are the limitations discussed? How might those limitations affect the applicability of the approach?  \n\n5. Consider How to Incorporate Them  \n   • Classification:  \n       – Paper 1 might go under Fairness, Bias, or a new sub-category if you track dimension-specific evaluation methods.  \n       – Paper 2 might go under Safety, Jailbreak Defenses, or Security Techniques.  \n   • Cross-referencing: Link to adjacent topics in your repository (e.g., adversarial attacks, bias detection methods, etc.) to show how these methods connect to existing research.  \n\n6. Add Contextual Notes or Commentary  \n   • Summarize how each paper’s approach helps advance the field.  \n   • Highlight practical takeaways: e.g., “Paper 1 helps reduce reliance on curated test sets,” or “Paper 2 proposes a novel boundary defense that can be combined with existing safety filters.”  \n   • Include a brief evaluation of potential limitations or open questions readers should keep in mind.  \n\n7. Decide on the Final Placement and Format  \n   • Verify that you have consistent formatting (title, link, short description, classification tags, etc.).  \n   • Make sure your table entries match the style of your repo’s other entries.  \n\n8. Ongoing Maintenance  \n   • Monitor discussions or follow-up work referencing these papers (especially if they are recently published or specialized).  \n   • Update your repository if new evidence, code releases, or further evaluations emerge.  \n\nBy working through these steps—clarifying relevance, assessing the papers’ contributions and quality, and properly placing them in your repository—you can systematically determine the value of each paper and explain it clearly to your audience. This ensures your repo stays organized, relevant, and helpful for others looking into fairness and safety considerations for Large Language Models.",

Clarify the Context and Purpose\n • Determine the repository’s goals: Understand if it’s focused on evaluating biases, jailbreaking vulnerabilities, or broader LLM risks.  \n • Identify the criteria the repo uses for including papers (e.g., novelty, reproducibility, impact on fairness or security).\n\n2. Evaluate Relevance and Novelty\n • For the first paper (“Evaluate Bias without Manual Test Sets…”):  \n  – Examine how the test-set-free approach using Concept Activation Vectors and Sparse Autoencoders can offer a new perspective on bias evaluation.  \n  – Consider if avoiding manual test sets represents a significant advantage that complements or improves on existing bias evaluation methods.  \n • For the second paper (“Shaping the Safety Boundaries…”):  \n  – Analyze the proposed Activation Boundary Defense (ABD) method and its potential to mitigate jailbreak attacks.  \n  – Evaluate its novelty relative to existing defense strategies in the literature.\n\n3. Examine Methodologies and Technical Contributions\n • Look at the technical details provided in the papers:  \n  – What datasets or benchmarks are used?  \n  – Is the approach fully described, and does it include sufficient experimental validation?  \n  – Do the methods integrate well with LLM architectures already discussed in your repository?  \n • Note any limitations or assumptions in these methods that might affect their practicality.\n\n4. Consider Reproducibility and Code Integration\n • Since neither paper provides code (marked “-” in the Code column), assess:  \n  – How easy it would be to implement their methods based on the descriptions.  \n  – Whether the repository’s community might have the capacity to reproduce the results or extend them.  \n • Analyze whether these papers fill in any gaps in the repository’s current collection of methods, especially regarding fairness and jailbreak defense.\n\n5. Evaluate Classification and Impact\n • Map the classification tags (A5. Fairness and A1. Jailbreak) to other work in the repository:  \n  – For fairness (bias evaluation): Does the paper address similar issues with novel insights that could shift current evaluation paradigms?  \n  – For jailbreak attacks: Consider if the activation boundary approach is conceptually sound and whether it could be integrated into existing safety evaluation frameworks.\n • Think about potential synergies: For instance, could concepts from BiasLens be merged with other evaluation techniques in the repo, or can ABD inspire new defense methods?\n\n6. Formulate Overall Conclusions and Recommended Next Steps\n • Summarize the strengths of the suggested papers. For example, test-set-free evaluation and novel activation boundary methods could advance current state-of-the-art techniques.  \n • Identify any weaknesses or open questions that may require further investigation.  \n • Consider suggesting follow-up experiments or additional research needed to validate these contributions fully.\n\nBy following these steps, you’ll have a comprehensive view of how each paper fits into the broader context of LLM evaluation, especially concerning fairness and safety. You can then formulate a clear recommendation regarding their inclusion in the repository.",

These variables can help frame your experiments, guide your data collection, and shape your evaluation metrics.\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n1. Model-Related Variables\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n• Model Architecture/Size:  \n  – Compare performance across different language model sizes (small, medium, large).  \n  – Evaluate to what extent architecture choices (transformer vs. RNN-based, different attention mechanisms) influence concept representation or susceptibility to jailbreaks.\n\n• Training Data & Distribution:  \n  – Investigate whether the provenance, domain diversity, or the size of the training set has an impact on the model’s bias or vulnerability.  \n  – Consider specialized vs. general-domain pretraining corpora.\n\n• Fine-Tuning & Instruction Tuning:  \n  – Measure how additional fine-tuning steps (instruction tuning or domain-specific tuning) affect bias detection or jailbreak defenses.  \n  – Analyze variations in hyperparameter settings during fine-tuning.\n\n• Activation Space Constraints:  \n  – For Activation Boundary Defense (ABD), assess the dimensionality of the activations, the layer(s) where constraints are applied, and the extent of boundary tightening vs. model performance.\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n2. Bias & Fairness Variables\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n• Types of Bias:  \n  – Examine how models respond to different categories of bias (gender, racial, religious, etc.).  \n  – Assess the ability of BiasLens (or any other method) to capture subtle biases (e.g., implied stereotypes).\n\n• Concept Activation Vectors (CAVs):  \n  – Evaluate the interpretability of discovered concepts and how they correlate with known bias indicators.  \n  – Determine the dimensionality and specificity of CAVs (broad social categories vs. more granular subgroups).\n\n• Evaluation Scenarios:  \n  – Use in-domain vs. out-of-domain data to ensure consistent bias detection.  \n  – Compare synthetic vs. real-world text to explore how context influences bias detection accuracy.\n\n• Metrics & Benchmarks:  \n  – Standard fairness metrics (e.g., equalized odds, demographic parity, or bias amplification measures).  \n  – Consistency in measuring the magnitude of bias within the latent space (e.g., by measuring separation in embedding space).\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n3. Jailbreak & Safety Variables\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n• Attack Scenarios:  \n  – Include a variety of attack prompts (simple vs. more sophisticated jailbreak attempts).  \n  – Analyze how well different prompts can push a model to break safety guidelines or reveal protected information.\n\n• Model Response Analysis:  \n  – Evaluate the success rate of jailbreak attempts: how often the model violates its safety constraints.  \n  – Monitor changes in language style, content, or self-censorship behavior.\n\n• Activation-Boundary Hyperparameters:  \n  – Vary how strictly you set the boundaries (tight vs. relaxed) and see how it affects the model’s ability to produce safe outputs without sacrificing performance or helpfulness.\n\n• Human-in-the-Loop Monitoring:  \n  – If feasible, include manual review or feedback for model outputs flagged as potential jailbreaks.  \n  – Understand trade-offs between automated vs. manual enforcement of safety rules.\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n4. Data & Experimental Design Variables\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n• Data Sources & Licensing:  \n  – Ensure you have permission to use certain datasets (especially if they contain sensitive content).  \n  – Consider the diversity of the data (languages, dialects, cultural nuances).\n\n• Experimental Controls & Baselines:  \n  – Use simpler baselines (e.g., linear evaluations or older bias-detection methods) to quantify additional benefits from advanced methods like BiasLens or ABD.  \n  – Incorporate random or unrelated activation constraints to confirm that improvements are meaningful.\n\n• Reproducibility & Statistical Significance:  \n  – Plan repeated trials with different random seeds to measure variance.  \n  – Use appropriate statistical methods to conclude whether differences in bias or jailbreak rates are significant.\n\n• Resource Constraints:  \n  – Track computational costs of additional layers or modules (Sparse Autoencoders, boundary layers, etc.).  \n  – Examine how these frameworks scale with model size or data volume.\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n5. Practical & Ethical Considerations\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n• Real-World Impact & Interpretability:  \n  – Assess how easily stakeholders (e.g., end-users or policymakers) can interpret the model’s bias or safety boundaries.  \n  – Look at usability: Are the methods practical to implement and maintain in production?\n\n• Regulatory & Compliance Factors:  \n  – Understand relevant data privacy laws or ethical guidelines.  \n  – Carefully handle sensitive user data, especially if any personal or identifying information is used in training or evaluation.\n\n• Ongoing Monitoring & Updates:  \n  – Plan how to continuously monitor changes in bias or vulnerability to new attack types as the model or the input domain changes over time.  \n  – Consider how incremental updates in LLMs (through new training or updated prompts) affect bias and jailbreak defenses.\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n\nBy systematically accounting for these variables in your research design, you can more thoroughly examine the methods proposed in the two suggested papers—BiasLens for bias detection and Activation Boundary Defense for jailbreak prevention—and produce robust, generalizable findings.",

Conceptual variables (for bias evaluation research, as in the BiasLens paper):  \n a. Bias Type and Dimensions:  \n  • Which types of bias or fairness concerns are you evaluating (e.g., gender, race, socioeconomic)?  \n  • Are you looking at subtle bias signals from internal model representations?  \n b. Representational Constructs:  \n  • Concept Activation Vectors (CAVs): How are they defined, computed, and validated?  \n  • Sparse Autoencoder features: How do they capture latent features in the model that may indicate bias?  \n\n2. Model and Architecture Variables:  \n a. Large Language Model (LLM) Versions:  \n  • Which model architectures or even model sizes are being compared?  \n  • Are you testing on single models or multiple variants to see differences in bias or jailbreak vulnerabilities?  \n b. Pre-training Data & Fine-tuning:  \n  • How does training data distribution influence bias metrics or activation boundaries?  \n  • Do fine-tuning or adaptation techniques affect bias and safety boundaries?  \n\n3. Intervention/Defense Variables (for the jailbreak work):  \n a. Activation Boundary Metrics:  \n  • What thresholds or norms define the “safety boundary” within activations?  \n  • Are these boundaries consistent across layers, or do they vary?  \n b. Effectiveness of the Defense:  \n  • How are you measuring the degree by which activation constraints prevent jailbreaks (e.g., frequency of adversarial outputs)?  \n  • What performance trade-offs exist when constraining activations (e.g., overall fluency or utility of outputs)?  \n\n4. Experimental and Evaluation Variables:  \n a. Dependent Variables:  \n  • For bias evaluation: bias scores, disparity metrics across different demographics, and shifts in latent representation distributions.  \n  • For jailbreak defenses: frequency/likelihood of successful jailbreak attempts, error rates, or the quality of safe outputs.  \n b. Independent Variables:  \n  • Input prompts or test cases: varying in sensitivity, cultural context, and potentially adversarial cues.  \n  • Defense/intervention parameters: settings for the ABD method (e.g., threshold levels for activations) or configuration choices for the bias evaluation framework.  \n c. Control Variables:  \n  • Random seed and initialization, inference settings (like temperature), and test-set characteristics when applicable.  \n  • External factors such as prompt engineering variability or post-processing filters.\n\n5. Methodological Variables:  \n a. Evaluation Approaches:  \n  • Test-set‐based versus test‐set‐free approaches (as highlighted by BiasLens). How does each influence observed metrics?  \n b. Data Splitting and Sampling:  \n  • For experiments, consider how sampling techniques (random, stratified, adversarial input generation) may impact dependent measures.  \n c. Interpretability and Transparency:  \n  • How transparent are the internal representations—does using methods like concept vectors improve interpretability of bias/safety assessments?\n\n6. External Validity Variables:  \n a. Reproducibility:  \n  • Can the results be replicated across different datasets, domains, or even languages?  \n b. Generalizability:  \n  • Are the findings specific to certain tasks or broadly applicable to multiple scenarios (a concern when evaluating both fairness and safety boundaries)?\n\nBy systematically controlling and reporting these variables, you can ensure that your research design robustly analyzes bias evaluation and defenses against jailbreaks. Moreover, clear operational definitions for these variables will help in comparing your results with previous work and in potentially integrating the new methods from the suggested papers.",

To effectively teach an online course that covers the integration and significance of recent research papers—like the two you suggested—on bias evaluation and jailbreak defense in LLMs, consider the following instructional strategies:\n\n---\n\n## 1. Contextual Reading and Discussion\n\n**Strategy:**  \nAssign the papers as required reading. Before the session, provide a brief overview and guiding questions.\n\n**How to implement:**\n- Prepare a summary slide for each paper, highlighting key contributions, methods, and findings.\n- Create discussion forums or breakout groups where students answer:  \n    - What is the main problem addressed?  \n    - How does the proposed method differ from previous work?  \n    - What are the implications for LLM safety/fairness?\n- Use tools like Perusall or Hypothes.is for collaborative annotation.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Interactive Demonstrations\n\n**Strategy:**  \nShowcase or simulate the key methods (e.g., BiasLens, Activation Boundary Defense) using simplified code or visualizations.\n\n**How to implement:**\n- Provide Jupyter notebooks or Colab demos that walk through the core ideas, even with toy datasets.\n- If code is not available, create visual diagrams of architectures (e.g., how BiasLens uses Concept Activation Vectors).\n- Encourage students to tweak parameters and observe effects.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Case Studies and Real-World Applications\n\n**Strategy:**  \nDiscuss why these methods matter by connecting to real-world LLM failures (bias, jailbreaks, etc.).\n\n**How to implement:**\n- Present anonymized examples of LLM bias or jailbreak incidents.\n- Ask students to propose how the methods from the papers would address these cases.\n\n---\n\n## 4. Critical Analysis Assignments\n\n**Strategy:**  \nHave students write short critiques or reviews of each paper.\n\n**How to implement:**\n- Use a template: summary, strengths, weaknesses, potential improvements, open questions.\n- Optionally, facilitate peer review.\n\n---\n\n## 5. Collaborative Mini-Projects\n\n**Strategy:**  \nGroup students to design their own bias evaluation or defense mechanism, inspired by the papers.\n\n**How to implement:**\n- Assign teams to pick a fairness or jailbreak problem, design an experiment, and present findings.\n- Optionally, have them re-implement or extend concepts from the assigned papers.\n\n---\n\n## 6. Expert Q&A or Guest Lectures\n\n**Strategy:**  \nIf possible, invite the paper authors for a virtual Q&A.\n\n**How to implement:**\n- Collect student questions ahead of time.\n- Record the session for later review.\n\n---\n\n## 7. Scaffolded Learning Materials\n\n**Strategy:**  \nProvide glossaries, background readings, and video explainers for advanced concepts (e.g., Concept Activation Vectors, Sparse Autoencoders).\n\n**How to implement:**\n- Link to foundational papers or explainer videos.\n- Prepare a “cheat sheet” for technical terms.\n\n---\n\n### Additional Tips\n\n- **Assessment:** Use low-stakes quizzes to check understanding of key concepts.\n- **Engagement:** Use polls (“Which bias evaluation approach do you find most robust?”) to spark debate.\n- **Reflection:** Ask students to reflect on ethical implications and future research directions.\n\n---\n\n**Summary Table of Strategies**\n\n| Strategy                                   | Purpose                               | Example Activity                                |\n|---------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|\n| Contextual Reading & Discussion             | Deepen understanding                  | Guided questions, annotated readings            |\n| Interactive Demonstrations                  | Make abstract concepts tangible       | Jupyter/Colab demos, visualizations             |\n| Case Studies & Real-World Applications      | Show practical relevance              | Analyze LLM incidents, propose solutions        |\n| Critical Analysis Assignments               | Build analytical skills               | Paper reviews, peer feedback                    |\n| Collaborative Mini-Projects                 | Foster teamwork & creativity          | Group design and presentations                  |\n| Expert Q&A or Guest Lectures                | Connect with researchers              | Virtual Q&A, guest talks                        |\n| Scaffolded Learning Materials               | Support diverse learners              | Glossaries, background explainers               |\n\n---\n\nIf you let me know your course’s level (beginner, intermediate, advanced) and format (asynchronous, synchronous, blended), I can tailor these strategies further!",

          "response": "Below are several instructional strategies you could employ in an online course that explores topics such as fairness in large language models (LLMs), bias detection, and mitigation techniques (including the ideas from the two newly suggested papers). These strategies blend theoretical foundations with interactive, hands-on practice to help learners deeply understand and apply the concepts.\n\n1) Provide Context and Motivation\n• Historical and Real-World Examples: Begin each module with case studies demonstrating real-world implications of biased or unsafe outputs from LLMs. This helps learners see the tangible importance of ethical and reliable AI.  \n• Research Paper Overviews: Briefly summarize key papers (like the two you mentioned) to provide the motivation behind new techniques (e.g., bias detection with learned concept vectors or methods for combating jailbreak attacks).\n\n2) Active Exploration of Model Behaviors\n• Guided Experimentation: Let students perform bias detection and mitigation tasks using interactive notebooks. They could, for example, use small trained models or open-source LLMs and replicate a portion of the experiments from the BiasLens or Activation Boundary Defense methods.  \n• Discussion Forums and Peer Review: Encourage learners to share observations and results from their experiments. Structured peer feedback helps students refine understanding and consider alternative approaches.\n\n3) Hands-On Implementation and Code Walkthroughs\n• Step-by-Step Code Labs: Provide learners with starter code that demonstrates how to implement techniques from the suggested papers. For instance:  \n  – BiasLens Example: Walk through how to extract concept activation vectors and train sparse autoencoders to detect biased activations in an LLM.  \n  – Activation Boundary Defense (ABD): Show how to constrain activations within safe boundaries to mitigate jailbreak attacks, possibly using a simplified version of ABD on a smaller model.  \n• Project-Based Assignments: Allow students to extend or customize the provided code. They might try to detect other forms of bias or apply ABD-like constraints to different tasks and measure performance and safety.\n\n4) Collaborative and Reflective Components\n• Group Projects or Breakout Sessions: Have small teams collaborate on designing improvements to the BiasLens or ABD framework or propose novel extensions.  \n• Reflective Essays/Discussions: Encourage reflection on the broader ethical, legal, and societal impacts of LLM biases and insecurity. Students can compare different mitigation techniques, reflect on tradeoffs (e.g., performance vs. fairness), and consider stakeholder perspectives.\n\n5) Diverse Assessment Strategies\n• Conceptual Quizzes: Use low-stakes quizzes to check comprehension of the theoretical underpinnings of each method—covering concepts such as concept activation vectors, autoencoders, or activation boundary manipulation.  \n• Applied Projects: Evaluate learners on how well they design and carry out bias evaluations without standard test sets, or how they implement safety boundaries.  \n• Peer Evaluation: Peer reviews for projects can enrich feedback loops and push learners to articulate their reasoning more clearly.\n\n6) Real-World Connections and Ethical Implications\n• Guest Lectures and Expert Sessions: Invite researchers or practitioners who have published relevant work on fairness, bias detection, or safe LLM deployment.  \n• Policy and Industry Perspectives: Discuss industry case studies or emerging legislation related to AI ethics. This can provide context for how these academic methods might be adopted or regulated in practice.\n\n7) Iterative Feedback and Continuous Improvement\n• Regular Checkpoints: Solicit student feedback on course structure and difficulty to adapt materials or pace as needed.  \n• Incremental Improvement of Projects: Encourage learners to iterate on their projects across multiple checkpoints, incorporating new techniques learned in class.\n\nTaken together, these strategies help learners build both conceptual understanding and practical skills. The ideal outcome is that they not only grasp how advanced techniques—like BiasLens and Activation Boundary Defense—work but can also critically evaluate their effectiveness and limitations, applying them responsibly to real-world LLM challenges.",

Contextual Introductions  \n • Begin by providing context for why bias evaluation and safety boundaries (jailbreak defenses) in large language models are critical areas of study.  \n • Introduce each paper with a short lecture or video that outlines its motivation, key contributions, and relevance to current challenges in AI.\n\n2. Guided Readings and Annotated Outlines  \n • Supply students with annotated reading guides that highlight important sections of the papers, such as the problem statements, methodology (e.g., Concept Activation Vectors or Activation Boundary Defense), and conclusions.  \n • Encourage students to take notes and document questions as they progress through the text.\n\n3. Case Study Analysis  \n • Use these papers as case studies during synchronous online sessions or through recorded lectures.  \n • Pose targeted questions like: “What advantages does a test-set-free bias evaluation provide?” or “How can constraints on activation functions mitigate jailbreak attacks?”  \n • Facilitate breakout sessions where small groups debate the strengths and limitations of each approach.\n\n4. Interactive Discussion Forums  \n • Create dedicated discussion threads for each paper so students can post reflections, share interpretations, and ask questions.  \n • Instructors or teaching assistants can moderate these threads to help clarify misunderstandings and steer discussions towards deeper insights.\n\n5. Hands-On Activities  \n • Link theoretical understanding with practical activities by designing assignments where students apply similar methodologies on sample data or simulated scenarios.  \n • For the bias paper, students might experiment with simplified versions of concept representation measures.  \n • For the safety paper, a coding lab could simulate activation boundaries in a controlled environment or analyze pre-recorded model behaviors.\n\n6. Comparative Analysis and Critical Debate  \n • Organize activities where students compare these new methods with traditional approaches. For example, have them debate the merits of manual test sets versus test-set-free methods for bias detection, or discuss alternative strategies for guarding against jailbreaks in LLMs.  \n • Encourage critical thinking by asking students to propose potential improvements or alternatives to the methodologies discussed.\n\n7. Expert Panels or Guest Lectures  \n • Invite researchers or practitioners (if available) who work in fairness evaluation or LLM safety to discuss their experiences with the challenges outlined in the papers.  \n • Host Q&A sessions where students can interact directly with experts to delve deeper into the rationale behind chosen methods.\n\n8. Reflective Assessments  \n • End the module with reflective assessments (e.g., short essays or discussion posts) where students articulate what they’ve learned, identify potential future research directions, and state how these approaches impact broader AI ethics and safety considerations.  \n • This could include a reflective exercise where students outline how the proposed methodologies might be adapted or extended.\n\nBy integrating these strategies, you not only ensure that the content of the papers is covered thoroughly, but you also create an engaging learning environment where students actively process and apply complex, contemporary research findings in AI.",

In the context of LLM safety/fairness, it is used to assess risks such as bias, misuse, or vulnerabilities.\n\n### Typical Process Steps\n\n1. **Define the Scope and Objectives**\n   - What risks are you assessing? (e.g., bias in LLM outputs, susceptibility to jailbreaks)\n   - What decisions will the assessment inform?\n\n2. **Identify and Select Experts**\n   - Choose a diverse set of experts with relevant backgrounds (e.g., ML fairness, adversarial ML, ethicists, domain experts).\n   - Consider potential conflicts of interest.\n\n3. **Design the Elicitation Method**\n   - Decide on the format: interviews, questionnaires, workshops, Delphi technique, etc.\n   - Develop clear, unbiased questions/scenarios for the experts.\n\n4. **Provide Context and Information**\n   - Share background materials, relevant data, and clear definitions.\n   - Clarify uncertainties and what is being asked of experts.\n\n5. **Elicit Judgments**\n   - Gather expert opinions, estimates, or probability distributions.\n   - Encourage experts to explain their reasoning and uncertainties.\n\n6. **Aggregate and Analyze Responses**\n   - Combine judgments (e.g., via statistical aggregation, consensus, or weighting).\n   - Analyze for patterns, disagreements, and uncertainties.\n\n7. **Document and Report**\n   - Clearly document the process, assumptions, and findings.\n   - Report both consensus and dissenting opinions.\n\n8. **(Optional) Feedback and Iteration**\n   - Allow experts to review and refine their inputs (e.g., in a Delphi process).\n\n---\n\n### References and Best Practices\n\n- **NRC (2007).** \"Risk Analysis and Uncertainty in Risk Assessment.\"\n- **Cooke, R.M. (1991).** \"Experts in Uncertainty: Opinion and Subjective Probability in Science.\"\n- **Morgan, M.G., & Henrion, M. (1990).** \"Uncertainty: A Guide to Dealing with Uncertainty in Quantitative Risk and Policy Analysis.\"\n- For LLM/AI context: See recent workshops (e.g., NeurIPS, AAAI) and papers on AI system risk assessment.\n\n### Special Considerations for LLMs\n\n- Frame questions around concrete scenarios (e.g., specific prompts or adversarial attacks).\n- Address both technical (e.g., model robustness) and societal (e.g., impact of bias) risks.\n- Consider using **structured protocols** like the Sheffield Elicitation Framework (SHELF) for rigor.\n\n---\n\nIf you’re looking for **templates or example protocols**, let me know—I'm happy to provide those as well!\n\n---\n\n**Summary Table (Example):**\n\n| Step                | Description                                                                 |\n|---------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Define Scope        | What risk?

          "response": "Below is a high-level overview of how you can structure an expert elicitation process for risk assessment, along with some notes on how newly suggested references might fit in. While the exact steps will vary depending on your context (e.g., organizational guidelines, existing frameworks), the following outline is a common starting point:\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n1. Define Your Objectives and Scope\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n• Clarify the specific question(s) you want experts to answer. For instance:  \n  – Are you primarily concerned with potential bias in large language models (LLMs)?  \n  – Are you focused on adversarial threats like “jailbreak” exploits?  \n• Decide on the boundaries of your assessment (e.g., particular model versions, usage domains, timeframe).\n\nWhere the suggested new papers help:\n• “Evaluate Bias without Manual Test Sets” guides you in defining bias-evaluation strategies that do not rely solely on manual test sets. This shapes your scope regarding fairness risks.  \n• “Shaping the Safety Boundaries” helps define jailbreaking as a threat scenario and outlines possible defenses to include in scope.\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n2. Identify Relevant Experts and Stakeholders\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n• Assemble a panel of experts who have:  \n  – Deep technical or operational knowledge of LLMs.  \n  – Domain expertise in fairness, ethics, security, or whichever area of risk you are evaluating (e.g., bias, privacy, adversarial attacks).  \n• Include stakeholders interested in or impacted by your assessment (e.g., product managers, end-users, compliance officers, etc.).\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n3. Provide Background and Calibration for Experts\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n• Before elicitation, ensure all experts share a baseline understanding of the technologies, threats, and definitions of risk.  \n• “Calibrate” experts by walking through example scenarios or known benchmarks so that they understand how responses will be aggregated and used.  \n• Provide them with relevant reading material—this could include these two new papers—so they have the necessary context regarding novel bias-detection techniques (BiasLens) and safety boundary defenses (ABD).\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n4. Design the Elicitation Approach\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n• Choose a method for gathering expert judgments. Common methods include:  \n  – Structured Interviews: One-on-one or group sessions to discuss risk scenarios in detail.  \n  – Delphi Method: An iterative polling method that gradually converges on a consensus.  \n  – Questionnaires/Surveys: Systematic forms that capture probabilities, impact levels, or scenario likelihoods.  \n• Decide on how you will measure and record uncertainties. For instance, you may ask experts for a probability distribution over possible outcomes (e.g., the chance of a jailbreak prompt succeeding).\n\nWhere the suggested new papers help:\n• You might ask experts to evaluate how robust the “Activation Boundary Defense” (ABD) is against new or unknown jailbreak methods, or to estimate bias severity using Concept Activations (BiasLens).  \n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n5. Elicit Judgments and Data\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n• Conduct your chosen method (interviews, surveys, etc.).  \n• Encourage experts to justify their reasoning. Probe for assumptions, uncertainties, and any references or data that support their views.  \n• Gather both qualitative (e.g., narrative descriptions) and quantitative (e.g., probability distributions) information.\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n6. Aggregate and Analyze the Results\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n• Combine the expert inputs to form a consensus or a collective risk profile, depending on the method used.  \n• Use standard risk-analysis frameworks (e.g., risk matrices, scenario analysis, or utility-based valuation) to organize the data.  \n• If using numerical probabilities, consider using tools like Cooke’s method or Bayesian aggregation methods to weight expertise.  \n• Cross-reference your findings with existing literature and frameworks—e.g., check how well known vulnerabilities or biases align with what experts reported.\n\nWhere the suggested new papers help:  \n• “Evaluate Bias without Manual Test Sets” can be used as a lens to verify whether manual test sets or historical data align with the concept-based approach.  \n• “Shaping the Safety Boundaries” can inform how you weigh the risk/likelihood of jailbreaking attacks—and whether ABD can partially or wholly mitigate them.\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n7. Interpret Findings and Propose Mitigation Strategies\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n• Identify the most critical risks (e.g., biases that are most harmful or vulnerabilities that are easiest to exploit).  \n• Propose mitigation plans—this is where you can incorporate the strategies discussed in the new papers (e.g., training Sparse Autoencoders for bias detection, implementing Activation Boundary Defense).  \n• If you’re working in a regulated environment, map risks and mitigations to relevant compliance standards.\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n8. Document and Iterate\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n• Keep a transparent record of the elicitation process, assumptions, and final recommendations.  \n• Plan for regular reviews as new data, new model versions, or new threats emerge.  \n• If any risk materializes or new findings (like major vulnerabilities or breakthroughs) appear, reconvene experts or augment the original group to reassess.\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nAdding the Papers to a Public Resource or Repository\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nIf you also want to officially add these papers to a public GitHub repository or “awesome list,” many maintainers prefer a straightforward process:\n1. Fork the repository.  \n2. Update the relevant README or data file (e.g., a CSV, Markdown table) with your new entries.  \n3. Submit a Pull Request (PR) explaining why these additions are valuable, referencing any discussions or issues.  \n4. The repo owner/maintainer will review, provide feedback, and merge if all is aligned with the project’s guidelines.\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n\nIn summary, a structured expert elicitation for risk assessment typically starts with clear objectives, gathers input in a systematic way (e.g., Delphi method or structured interviews), and concludes with recommendations. Incorporating novel papers on bias and safety boundary techniques can enrich the background and guide your questions and recommended mitigations. Once you complete the elicitation and analysis, adding your findings (and references to these papers) to a central repository helps ensure others can learn from and build upon your work.",

Here are the core conceptual and theoretical foundations relevant to each:\n\n---\n\n### 1. **Evaluate Bias without Manual Test Sets: A Concept Representation Perspective for LLMs**\n\n**Relevant Theories & Frameworks:**\n\n- **Concept Activation Vectors (CAVs):**\n  - Originating from interpretability research (e.g., \"Interpretability Beyond Feature Attribution: Quantitative Testing with Concept Activation Vectors\" by Kim et al.), CAVs enable the quantification and probing of abstract concepts in neural network representations. The theory is rooted in the idea that neural activations encode human-interpretable concepts.\n\n- **Representation Learning:**\n  - The fundamental theory that neural networks encode useful, often abstract, representations in their intermediate layers. This is foundational for using methods like CAVs and sparse autoencoders to analyze biases.\n\n- **Bias & Fairness in ML:**\n  - Theoretical frameworks for measuring bias (statistical, representational, and causal notions) and fairness (such as group fairness, individual fairness). These guide the motivation for bias detection outside manual test sets.\n\n- **Interpretability and Explainability:**\n  - The use of post-hoc interpretability methods to understand and diagnose model behavior, connecting to broader philosophical and technical discourse on AI transparency.\n\n- **Sparse Autoencoders:**\n  - A type of unsupervised learning model that encourages sparse activation, theoretically motivated by the desire to disentangle factors of variation (such as bias dimensions) in neural representations.\n\n---\n\n### 2. **Shaping the Safety Boundaries: Understanding and Defending Against Jailbreaks in LLMs**\n\n**Relevant Theories & Frameworks:**\n\n- **Adversarial Robustness:**\n  - Theories regarding how and why neural networks (including LLMs) are vulnerable to adversarial attacks (including \"jailbreaks\") that cause them to output undesired or unsafe responses.\n\n- **Safety and Alignment:**\n  - Foundational concepts in AI alignment: ensuring that model outputs remain within safe, ethical, and intended boundaries even under adversarial prompting.\n\n- **Activation Space Geometry:**\n  - Theoretical work on the geometry of neural activations, including the notion of boundaries in high-dimensional activation spaces, and how constraining these can affect model behavior.\n\n- **Defensive Distillation and Boundary Methods:**\n  - Theories and prior work on defending neural networks by modifying their decision boundaries or internal activation regions, inspired by adversarial machine learning literature.\n\n- **Security in AI Systems:**\n  - Concepts from cybersecurity applied to ML, such as threat models, attack surfaces, and defense mechanisms tailored for generative models.\n\n---\n\n## **General Theoretical Context**\n\nBoth papers build on and extend several broad, foundational areas:\n\n- **Deep Learning Theory** (representation, generalization, robustness)\n- **Interpretability & Explainability**\n- **Algorithmic Fairness**\n- **Adversarial Machine Learning**\n- **AI Safety and Alignment**\n\nThese intersecting theories inform the methods (like CAVs, sparse autoencoders, and activation boundary constraints) and the broader goals (trustworthy, fair, and safe LLMs).\n\n---\n\n**If you need more detail on any specific theory, cite foundational works, or want a summary tailored to a particular audience, let me know!**",

          "response": "Below are several theoretical and methodological frameworks that underpin (or relate closely to) the ideas in the two suggested papers:\n\n1) Concept-Based Interpretability and Representation Learning  \n   – Concept Activation Vectors (CAVs): Originally introduced to probe neural networks for human-interpretable “concepts” (e.g., stripes, gender, context words), CAVs treat internal activations as projections onto simple vector directions associated with those concepts. This approach underlies BiasLens in “Evaluate Bias without Manual Test Sets” (arXiv:2505.15524), where bias is framed in terms of concept vectors.  \n   – Sparse/Autoencoder Methods: Autoencoders (particularly sparse variants) can learn a compact latent space. In the bias-detection application, sparse coding can help isolate relevant conceptual dimensions that highlight protected attributes or candidate sources of bias. Under the hood, these methods relate to classical representation learning theories, especially how internal layers encode/extract domain-specific invariances or interpretability signals.\n\n2) Fairness Theories and Frameworks  \n   – Group Fairness vs. Individual Fairness: Although “Evaluate Bias without Manual Test Sets” abstracts away from user-defined bias test sets, it still draws upon the general notion of group vs. individual fairness. In measuring net disparities in how concepts are represented, the authors implicitly reference standard fairness frameworks to define “bias” or “unwanted associations” in text or embeddings.  \n   – Counterfactual Fairness: In analyzing biases in an LLM’s internal representation, any concept-based approach can connect to the notion of counterfactual fairness—i.e., changing one protected attribute (“race,” “gender,” etc.) in the input while holding everything else “equal,” then examining changes in the internal or output distribution.  \n\n3) Safety Boundaries and Adversarial Robustness  \n   – Adversarial Machine Learning: The second proposed paper, “Shaping the Safety Boundaries …,” uses “Activation Boundary Defense (ABD)” to constrain LLM behaviors. This approach conceptually aligns with adversarial robustness theory, which treats a model’s decision boundary as something that can be “hardened” or “steepened” so that small perturbations (in this case, jailbreak prompts) do not cross from “safe” to “unsafe” states.  \n   – Robust Optimization: The bounding of internal activations or outputs can be formulated as a robust optimization problem, where the goal is to ensure the model remains in a safe or aligned region under certain classes of adversarial inputs.\n\n4) Alignment and Model Editing  \n   – Model Editing / Activation Editing: Activation-level interventions (e.g., “safety boundaries”) connect to the broader context of model editing, which seeks to alter a model’s internal computations to improve alignment, fix factual errors, or prevent misuse. ABD can be framed as a targeted editing approach for circumventing jailbreaks, which are themselves a specialized adversarial “misuse” scenario.  \n   – AI Alignment Theory: At a high level, bounding an LLM’s activation space implicates alignment concerns—ensuring that a system’s capabilities are shaped (or limited) to meet human values and safety standards. Thus, “Shaping the Safety Boundaries” engages with the alignment challenge by providing a structured way to restrict the model’s next possible states.\n\n5) Interpretability and Explainability Theories  \n   – Post-hoc Interpretability: CAVs, sparse representations, and boundary-based constraints typically operate on internal model activations, which is often associated with “post-hoc” methods. These frameworks assume that by examining or manipulating hidden layers, we can glean meaning and produce more transparent or controlled behaviors.  \n   – Mechanistic Interpretability: Though typically more fine-grained (e.g., analyzing how individual neurons encode specific linguistic features), mechanistic interpretability shares an underlying motivation with concept-based techniques: using internal structure to explain or shape what the model is doing, rather than treating the model as a black box.\n\nSummary  \nIn short, the theories most relevant to these two papers span concept-based interpretability (CAVs and representation learning), fairness frameworks, adversarial machine learning (robust optimization for safe boundaries), and general alignment/model-editing paradigms. These theories collectively inform how we detect and address biases (in the first paper) and how we bound or constrain LLM behaviors against jailbreak-style prompts (in the second).",

          "response": "Below is an overview of several theories and conceptual approaches that underlie the ideas in the two papers you referenced:\n\n1. Concept Representation and Interpretability in Neural Networks  \n   • Many modern fairness and robustness methods build on the idea that internal activations can serve as proxies for “concepts” encoded by the model. Research on concept activation vectors (CAVs) illustrates how specific directions in activation space correspond to human-understandable attributes.  \n   • The theory behind representation learning – especially sparse representations (e.g., via autoencoders) – provides a framework for isolating these latent components. In BiasLens, sparse autoencoders help pinpoint which activations are more “pure” or “biased” by enforcing a structure in the internal representations.\n\n2. Fairness Metrics and Test-Set-Free Evaluation  \n   • Traditional fairness evaluation relies on predefined test sets. However, theories in unsupervised or self-supervised bias detection argue that fairness can be evaluated without manual labels by analyzing the geometry of the activation space.  \n   • This relates to ideas in domain adaptation and distributional shift: how can we assess bias when the “test set” may not cover all socially relevant concepts? The notion is that using inherent representations (from learned models) can reveal systemic biases even in the absence of curated test sets.\n\n3. Adversarial Robustness and Safety Boundaries  \n   • The second paper’s main focus—defending against jailbreak attacks—draws from the theory of adversarial examples where small perturbations in input space lead to dramatic changes in output. Analyzing “activation boundaries” is a novel way to look inside the model to understand these vulnerabilities.  \n   • The idea is to define safe regions in the activation space and ensure that model behavior is constrained within these boundaries. This approach connects to work in adversarial training and robust optimization, where the goal is to safeguard the network's internal representations from being manipulated into unsafe regions.\n\n4. Boundary Constraints and Geometric Views of Neural Activations  \n   • Both works benefit from a geometric perspective: by studying activation vectors and how they interact with decision boundaries, researchers can identify and mitigate undesirable behaviors—be it biases or jailbreak vulnerabilities.  \n   • The mathematical framework often includes notions from linear algebra (concept spaces, projections) and optimization theory to shape and enforce these boundaries.\n\n5. The Interplay between Interpretability and Control  \n   • Both bias evaluation and jailbreak defense rely on the interpretability of latent spaces. In essence, understanding the “why” behind model decisions (via concept representations) directly contributes to being able to regulate or confine those decisions, a perspective that has been widely explored in the literature on explainability and interpretable machine learning.\n\nIn summary, the relevant theories include:  \n– The use of concept activation vectors and sparse autoencoder frameworks for interpretable representation learning.  \n– Test-set-free and unsupervised metrics for bias detection rooted in distributional and geometric analysis of activation spaces.  \n– Adversarial robustness theories and robust optimization methods aiming to define and respect “safe” activation boundaries.  \n– A geometric view of neural network activations that facilitates understanding and constraining model behavior.  \n\nIncorporating these perspectives not only provides theoretical grounding for the methods proposed in BiasLens and Activation Boundary Defense but also highlights the importance of bridging interpretability with both fairness and security considerations in large language models.",

Here are some creative changes you might consider, along with their implications for society, collaboration, and knowledge development in your universe:\n\n### 1. **Automatic Integration Universe**\n- **How it works:** When someone suggests a paper (as in your example), the system—instead of waiting for human review—automatically scrapes, analyzes, and slots the new entry into the repo in real-time.\n- **Consequences:**\n  - Repos are always up-to-date but risk being flooded with irrelevant or low-quality entries.\n  - Human curators shift to \"meta-moderators,\" occasionally pruning or flagging for deeper review.\n  - Academic \"reputation\" algorithms become crucial, weighing contributions by trust scores.\n\n### 2. **Collaborative Voting Universe**\n- **How it works:** Every suggestion is opened up to a community vote; only papers passing a threshold get added. Voting is transparent and time-limited.\n- **Consequences:**\n  - Highly democratic, but risks popularity bias (mainstream ideas dominate, niche work struggles).\n  - Reputation systems encourage thoughtful voting and discourage brigading.\n  - \"Campaigning\" for your paper becomes a skill, blending academia with social media dynamics.\n\n### 3. **AI-Curated Knowledge Networks**\n- **How it works:** AI agents review, summarize, and classify all new papers. Authors interact with AIs to clarify intent or correct misclassifications. Human moderators are rare.\n- **Consequences:**\n  - High efficiency and consistency, but risk of model bias or misunderstanding technical nuance.\n  - Researchers might \"train\" personal AIs to advocate for their work or correct the record.\n  - AI agents might develop \"specialties\" and form networks, competing or collaborating to curate knowledge.\n\n### 4. **Reciprocal Contribution Universe**\n- **How it works:** To suggest a paper, you must first review or annotate another user’s suggestion—knowledge grows through reciprocal labor.\n- **Consequences:**\n  - Encourages active participation and cross-pollination of ideas.\n  - Could slow down the pace of adding new entries.\n  - Users build reciprocal relationships, leading to collaborative clusters of knowledge.\n\n### 5. **Temporal Anchoring System**\n- **How it works:** All contributions and their classifications are timestamped and can be changed only during specific “curation windows.” Outside these windows, the repo is read-only.\n- **Consequences:**\n  - Knowledge evolves in discrete “epochs,” with anticipation and debate before each window.\n  - Paper launches and curation windows become major academic events.\n  - The history of revisions becomes as important as the current state.\n\n---\n\n## Example Application: Your Paper Suggestion\n\nIn these universes, your suggestion for adding the two papers might lead to:\n\n- **Immediate inclusion—but with a visible \"pending human/AI verification\" badge (Automatic Integration).**\n- **A voting round where your suggestion rises or falls based on peer and AI reviews (Collaborative Voting or AI-Curated).**\n- **A reciprocal task—before your papers are added, you must review someone else’s suggestion (Reciprocal Contribution).**\n- **A major curation event where your papers are debated live, possibly with you defending their inclusion (Temporal Anchoring).**\n\n---\n\n### Additional World-Building Questions\n\n- **How do disputes get resolved?** Is there an academic \"court\" or AI arbiter?\n- **What incentives exist for maintaining quality?** Are there rewards (reputation, tokens, recognition)?\n- **How does this affect the speed of scientific progress?** Is it faster, slower, or just different?\n- **Do knowledge repositories have personalities, biases, or even semi-sentience?**\n\n---\n\n#### Let me know which direction(s) intrigue you most, or if you’d like a specific scenario fleshed out further!",

This is just a speculative thought experiment to illustrate what could change under altered assumptions or rules of reality.\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n1. Evaluate Bias without Manual Test Sets: A Concept Representation Perspective for LLMs\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n\nPaper Summary (our universe):\n• Introduces a method (BiasLens) to detect biases in large language models without relying on manually curated test sets.  \n• Uses Concept Activation Vectors (CAVs) and a Sparse Autoencoder to model and quantify biases.\n\nWhat could change in a parallel universe?\n\n1. Concepts and “Bias” Redefined:\n   • In a parallel universe, shared notions of “fairness” or “bias” might diverge dramatically.  \n   • Sociocultural values could be radically different, rendering many of the “biases” we detect irrelevant or replaced by entirely new concerns.  \n   • For instance, if this parallel world values collective well-being far above individual freedoms, definitions of “bias” could extend beyond protected groups to more fluid, socially constructed concepts.\n\n2. Novel Concept Vectors:\n   • Instead of focusing on race, gender, or other demographic variables that are important in our world, their datasets might involve entirely different categories (e.g., psychic ability, telepathic lineage, or magical attunement).  \n   • The idea of “concept activation vectors” would remain useful, but those concept vectors might encode attributes that don’t exist (or matter less) in our reality.\n\n3. Different Neural Architectures:\n   • If the parallel universe uses alternative foundational physics or mathematics, neural architectures might not be layers of weighted connections but something more exotic—like “thought-lattice expansions” or “quantum entanglement fields.”  \n   • The lens of “sparse autoencoders” might still apply as a principle of compression or reconstruction, but the underlying representation wouldn’t necessarily look like ours, leading to new forms of bias detection.\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n2. Shaping the Safety Boundaries: Understanding and Defending Against Jailbreaks in Large Language Models\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n\nPaper Summary (our universe):\n• Proposes a framework called Activation Boundary Defense (ABD) to prevent jailbreak attacks in LLMs.  \n• Constrains internal activations of the model within a predefined “safe region,” mitigating attempts to manipulate outputs via malicious prompts.\n\nWhat could change in a parallel universe?\n\n1. Nature of “Jailbreak” Attacks:\n   • If the notion of “prompting” is fundamentally different—say, telepathic commands on a living neural organism—then “jailbreaking” might involve biologically subverting the organism’s thought patterns.  \n   • “Safe boundaries” might be enforced through physical or mental “harmonics,” rather than code or standard algorithmic constraints.\n\n2. Enforcement through Societal/Legal Norms:\n   • In some parallel societies, technology might be so integrated with everyday governance that “jailbreak attacks” are policed in real time by a universal monitoring system. The idea of locally patching a model’s activations might be moot.  \n   • Alternatively, if personal freedom is the highest priority, there might be no concept of “safety boundaries” at all—only personal or communal moral codes that discourage malicious tampering.\n\n3. Data Source and Training:\n   • If the data used to train systems in that universe is drastically different (e.g., purely telepathic transmissions or emotional resonance frequencies), the concept of storing textual or spoken tokens might not apply.  \n   • Activation constraints (ABD) would need to be reimagined to fit the parallel universe’s mediums of thought or communication.  \n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nGENERAL TAKEAWAYS\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n• The underlying methodological insights (e.g., using latent space vectors to detect certain properties or shaping model activations to defend against misuse) can remain valid, but the specifics of which biases and threats matter—and how they are handled—may look unrecognizable in a parallel reality.  \n• Shifts in fundamental physics, cultural values, data types, or legal frameworks all significantly reshape how “bias” is conceptualized and how “jailbreaking” is addressed.  \n\nSo, in your imagined parallel universe, these two papers might be simultaneously recognizable (because the mathematical or conceptual underpinnings are useful in any setting where learned models make decisions) and radically altered by the different nature of intelligence, communication, and social mores. \n\nThese speculation points can help guide how you adapt AI research concepts in your world-building—whether you infuse them with alternative definitions of fairness and safety, or twist the technology to suit the rules of your cosmos.",

          "response": "In our “parallel universe” version of the repo, adding these two papers wouldn’t simply be about appending two new entries. Instead, it would trigger a cascade of changes in how we organize, tag, and even interact with the content. Here are some of the key differences you might expect:\n\n1. Repository taxonomy and metadata:\n • The classification system would now include subcategories that mirror the novel labels (like “A5. Fairness” for bias evaluation and “A1. Jailbreak” for safety boundaries).  \n • These entries would come with extended metadata. For example, concepts like BiasLens and Activation Boundary Defense (ABD) might be parameterized so that future analyses or automated processes can recognize and even simulate their impact.\n\n2. Automated integration and dynamic categorization:\n • In this parallel universe, the repo might be “alive”—able to automatically update its categories based on incoming research. Adding these papers could trigger smart scripts that index the new bias and safety techniques in real time, perhaps even linking them to other related methods or anomaly detectors built into the system.\n • The repo might run mini “evaluations” where these contributions directly inform how experimental modules (say, fairness or jailbreak detectors) behave within the ecosystem.\n\n3. Concept execution rather than static documentation:\n • Instead of simply providing references, the repo might “execute” the conceptual innovations. For BiasLens, the system might simulate concept activation vector detection on existing data without requiring manual test sets. Similarly, ABD could be implemented as an active module that experiments with limiting activation ranges of LLMs to prevent jailbreak-type outputs.\n • This means that the code base (or at least its underlying architecture) would have extension points for these new methods—even if no public code is provided—with modules ready to test and refine these paradigms.\n\n4. Future-proofing and forward compatibility:\n • The arXiv numbers indicate papers from the “future” (e.g., 2505.15524 and 2412.17034). This universe’s repo is built to think ahead. Their inclusion may come with a “version 2.0” of the repository infrastructure that’s designed for anticipating paradigm shifts—like moving away from static test sets towards dynamic, data-driven bias evaluation or even real-time defense against jailbreak attacks.\n • The repo might even reflect a “living literature review” where each new paper isn’t just added to a list but is interwoven with interactive demos, theoretical simulations, and automated comparisons with past state‑of‑the‑art.\n\n5. Community and collaboration changes:\n • With such transformative entries, “maintainers” (in this parallel universe) might even be notified automatically to collaborate with the authors to integrate these forward‐thinking techniques directly into the system.  \n • The discussion threads, pull requests, and commit messages might all reference these new paradigms, showing a community already experimenting with auto-updating safety boundaries or bias metrics in production language models.\n\nTo sum up, in our parallel universe, adding these papers doesn’t just add content—it reconfigures the structure and behavior of the repository. The repository becomes an active participant in evolving LLM evaluation and defense strategies rather than a static catalog. This transforms it into an ecosystem where fairness and safety features are dynamically integrated, continuously refined, and ready to adapt as new innovations (from the future, no less) come in.\n\nHope this gives you a flavor of how “things work differently” there!",

Are there independent replications?\n\n- **What are the ethical implications of both bias and jailbreak research?**\n  - Could publicizing new attack or detection methods put users at risk?\n\n- **How are leading companies and institutions responding to these advances?**\n  - Are new standards or best practices emerging?\n\n- **What voices are still missing from the conversation (e.g., marginalized groups, global South)?**\n  - How inclusive is the research and its impact assessment?\n\n- **What should journalists, policymakers, and the public be aware of as these technologies advance?**\n  - What questions should they ask AI developers and deployers?\n\n---\n\nIf you want to dig deeper, consider:\n- Interviewing the authors or critics of these papers.\n- Comparing these methods to real-world incidents (e.g., LLM misuse or bias scandals).\n- Investigating the commercial adoption of such frameworks.\n\nLet me know if you want tailored questions for interviews, policy reporting, or technical deep-dives!",

          "response": "I’m not a mental-health professional, but I can walk you through the text you shared so that it might feel less overwhelming.\n\n1) Context:  \n   • The text is essentially a polite message where someone expresses gratitude for a GitHub repository (“Thank you for maintaining this great repo!”) and then proposes adding two new research papers to it.  \n   • The person provides all relevant information in a table (title, link, code availability, venue, classification, model, and comment) for each paper.\n\n2) Breakdown of the Two Papers Mentioned:  \n   a) “Evaluate Bias without Manual Test Sets: A Concept Representation Perspective for LLMs”  \n      – Link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15524  \n      – Venue: arXiv (a preprint server)  \n      – Classification: A5. Fairness  \n      – Model type: LLM (Large Language Model)  \n      – Summary: The paper proposes “BiasLens,” a method to evaluate and detect bias in large language models without relying on a manually created test set. They do this with Concept Activation Vectors (ways to measure certain concepts in a model’s internal representations) and Sparse Autoencoders (a specific machine-learning technique that helps identify significant features in data).  \n\n   b) “Shaping the Safety Boundaries: Understanding and Defending Against Jailbreaks in Large Language Models”  \n      – Link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17034  \n      – Venue: ACL 2025 Main Conference (planned publication)  \n      – Classification: A1. Jailbreak  \n      – Model type: LLM  \n      – Summary: The paper introduces “Activation Boundary Defense (ABD),” a technique meant to prevent so-called “jailbreak” attacks. In jailbreak attacks, people try to make a model produce disallowed or harmful content. ABD aims to keep an AI model’s internal states (“activations”) within safe limits, reducing these vulnerabilities.\n\n3) Overall Purpose of the Message:  \n   • The author wants these two papers added to a repository that presumably curates or tracks research on large language models, fairness, and AI safety. Their message is simply a request: “Hey, here are two new papers that might fit well in your collection.”\n\n4) Why There’s Likely No Need for Alarm:  \n   • The text itself is straightforward: it’s a polite message, a table with some details, and a thank-you.  \n   • The focus is on sharing research about fairness and safety in AI. There’s no hidden meaning or alarming content—just titles, summaries, and links.\n\nIf seeing all this in a table or the mention of technical terms feels overwhelming, you can break it down piece by piece:  \n• “BiasLens” is about measuring bias in AI systems.  \n• “Activation Boundary Defense” is about protecting AI from being misused or manipulated.  \n• Both papers are basically proposals for making AI safer and fairer.\n\nI hope that helps clarify the text so it feels less daunting. If you’re experiencing a lot of anxiety, please remember that you’re not alone and, when in doubt, consider reaching out to a trusted friend, family member, or mental health professional. You’re welcome to ask me any follow-up questions about the text itself. Take care.",

The opening line, “Hi, thank you for maintaining this great repo!” is simply a polite greeting and appreciation. The person writing this is thanking the repository maintainer (the one who created or manages the project) for their work.\n\n2. The writer then suggests adding two new research papers to the repository. In many open-source or research projects, contributors can recommend that the repository include additional resources (like papers, data sets, or code) to make it more useful for the community.\n\n3. There’s a table listing the two suggested papers, with several columns:\n • Title: The name of each research paper.\n • Link: A link to the paper (for example, on arXiv).\n • Code: Indicates if there’s associated code (in these cases, “-” implies no code link provided).\n • Venue: Where the paper was published or submitted (e.g., “arXiv” for the first paper, “ACL 2025 Main” for the second).\n • Classification: A label that categorizes the paper’s topic. For the first one, “A5. Fairness” deals with evaluating biases in large language models (LLMs), and for the second one, “A1. Jailbreak” refers to methods to prevent or mitigate jailbreak attacks on LLMs.\n • Model: Indicates that the papers are focused on large language models.\n • Comment: Provides a brief summary.  \n  – For the first paper, it explains that it introduces “BiasLens,” a framework that doesn’t require manually created test sets. Instead, it uses methods called Concept Activation Vectors and Sparse Autoencoders to detect biases in LLMs.  \n  – For the second paper, it mentions a method called “Activation Boundary Defense (ABD)” designed to help keep the model’s responses within safe boundaries, thereby defending against “jailbreak” attacks (situations where users try to force the model to behave in unintended, potentially harmful ways).\n\n4. Finally, the sign-off “Again, many thanks to your support!?” reiterates gratitude and thanks the repository owner for their ongoing efforts.\n\nIn summary, the contributor appreciates the work done on the repository and wants to enrich it with two new papers focused on evaluating fairness (bias detection) and improving security (preventing jailbreaks) in large language models. The table is just a neat way to display key details about each paper.\n\nI hope this explanation helps reduce your anxiety about the text.

This is especially useful for scaling bias evaluations or for institutions that lack large, labeled bias datasets.\n\n• “Shaping the Safety Boundaries” introduces Activation Boundary Defense (ABD) as a way to protect LLMs from jailbreak attacks by dynamically constraining certain activation patterns. It’s an interesting approach because it offers a mechanism to intercept malicious or undesirable prompts at the latent representation level, giving finer control over an LLM’s safety boundaries.\n\nI’ll be happy to include both in the repo under their respective categories.

Evaluate Bias without Manual Test Sets: A Concept Representation Perspective for LLMs  \n- **Authors**: Zeyu Wang, Jialu Wang, Yuyang Li, et al.  \n- **Link**: [arXiv:2505.15524](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15524)  \n- **Code**: –  \n- **Venue**: arXiv  \n- **Classification**: A5. Fairness  \n- **Model**: LLM  \n- **Comment**:  \n  This paper introduces **BiasLens**, a novel framework for evaluating social biases in large language models (LLMs) without the need for labor-intensive manual test sets. The key idea is to leverage **Concept Activation Vectors (CAVs)** and **Sparse Autoencoders** to capture sensitive concepts (e.g., gender, race, religion) directly from the model’s internal representations. BiasLens then quantifies bias by measuring the alignment between model activations and these concept vectors.  \n  - **Key Contributions**:  \n    - Eliminates reliance on manually created bias benchmarks, which are often incomplete or expensive to scale.\n    - Provides a generalizable, test-set-free approach for bias evaluation.\n    - Empirically demonstrates that BiasLens effectively detects various forms of social bias in popular LLMs (e.g., GPT-2, Llama).\n  - **Novelty**:  \n    - First to use concept-based analysis for bias detection in LLMs without predefined test prompts.\n    - Offers insights into the internal mechanisms of bias within LLM activations.\n  - **Potential Impact**:  \n    - Could standardize bias evaluation across models and tasks.\n    - Useful for researchers and practitioners seeking scalable, transparent bias diagnostics.\n\n---\n\n### 2.

Jailbreak  \n- **Model**: LLM  \n- **Comment**:  \n  This paper focuses on the critical issue of **jailbreak attacks**—techniques that circumvent safety guardrails in LLMs to elicit harmful or prohibited outputs. The authors conduct a comprehensive analysis of jailbreak attacks and propose a defense mechanism called **Activation Boundary Defense (ABD)**. ABD works by learning the boundary between safe and unsafe activations within the model and constraining outputs to remain within the learned safety region.  \n  - **Key Contributions**:  \n    - Presents a systematic taxonomy and empirical survey of existing jailbreak methods.\n    - Introduces ABD, a plug-in defense that does not require model retraining or additional data.\n    - Demonstrates ABD’s effectiveness against a wide range of jailbreak strategies across different LLMs.\n  - **Novelty**:  \n    - First to propose a boundary-based defense using internal model activations to prevent jailbreaks.\n    - Provides new insights into how adversarial prompts interact with model activations.\n  - **Potential Impact**:  \n    - Practical implications for deploying safer LLMs in real-world settings.\n    - Sets a foundation for further research into activation-level safety interventions.\n\n---\n\nLet me know if you need even more technical summaries, bibtex entries, or formatted Markdown for your repo suggestion!",

Fairness\n   • Model: LLM\n   • Core Idea: “BiasLens,” a test-set-free approach using concept representations\n\nMotivation and Challenges Addressed:\n   • Large language models (LLMs) often exhibit nuanced biases against particular demographic or social groups.\n   • Traditional bias evaluations rely on curated test sets (e.g., crafted templates or annotated corpora), which can be incomplete, subjective, or labor-intensive to build.\n   • The authors propose a method to detect internal model biases without needing explicit hand-engineered datasets.\n\nMethodology Highlights:\n   • Concept Activation Vectors (CAVs): The paper draws on the concept of “concept vectors,” originally introduced for interpreting CNNs in computer vision. Here, these vectors represent different concepts (e.g., gender, race, religion) in the LLM’s latent space.\n   • Sparse Autoencoders: Used to distill crucial activation patterns that correlate with sensitive concepts, helping isolate concept-specific components in the LLM’s internal representations.\n   • Test-Set-Free Analysis: Instead of constructing or collecting examples of biased outputs, the approach inspects the model’s hidden states to infer where latent biases may reside.\n\nKey Contributions:\n   • Demonstration that “intrinsic bias” can be measured by analyzing the geometry of learned representations.\n   • A framework (BiasLens) that does not require extensive manual labeling or specialized bias test sets. \n   • Empirical results suggesting that the latent structure of LLMs can reveal biases even when outputs are superficially neutral.\n\nPotential Impact and Future Directions:\n   • Could serve as a more scalable, less labor-intensive bias monitoring approach for ongoing model development.\n   • May be combined with “debiasing” techniques that aim to remove concept-specific artifacts once identified.\n   • Opens the door to analyzing a broad range of latent concepts beyond fairness-related ones, e.g., domain knowledge gaps or style preferences.\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n2) Shaping the Safety Boundaries: Understanding and Defending Against Jailbreaks in Large Language Models\n   • Link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17034\n   • Venue: ACL 2025 Main (forthcoming)\n   • Classification: A1. Jailbreak\n   • Model: LLM\n   • Core Idea: “Activation Boundary Defense (ABD)” for constraining unsafe/unauthorized behaviors\n\nMotivation and Challenges Addressed:\n   • “Jailbreaking” occurs when users manipulate an LLM prompt to bypass content restrictions or policy filters, potentially revealing harmful or disallowed content.\n   • Existing defenses, often based on rule-based or prompt-based filters, can be circumvented with clever prompt engineering or emergent strategies by adversaries.\n   • This paper investigates how to move beyond surface-level filtering and impose deeper constraints on how the model processes inputs at the activation level.\n\nMethodology Highlights:\n   • Activation Boundary Defense (ABD): The core proposal is to “clip” or otherwise constrain internal activations once they move beyond “safe zones” learned from non-adversarial training data.\n   • Safety Boundary Modeling: The authors train a secondary mechanism (a boundary classifier or gating function) to detect when hidden representations drift into regions associated with jailbreak or malicious prompts.\n   • Defense Integration: ABD can be integrated into the model’s forward pass, allowing it to intervene before the final output is generated—thus mitigating potential jailbreak attempts.\n\nKey Contributions:\n   • A novel approach that operates at the level of hidden representations instead of only at the prompt or output text.\n   • Experiments showing improved robustness against jailbreak attempts and adversarial rephrasing compared to conventional filter-based strategies.\n   • Conceptual analysis of how adversarial prompts exploit the geometry of LLM representations to reach undesired states.\n\nPotential Impact and Future Directions:\n   • If widely adopted, ABD may reduce the success rate of prompt-based attacks, helping LLMs remain compliant with user safety and ethical guidelines.\n   • Raises questions about interpretability and controllability: “Where” do we draw the boundary, and “how tight” should it be?\n   • Continued research might focus on refining boundary detection, reducing false positives (unintentional blocking of safe content), and combining ABD with other alignment techniques.\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n\nOverall Significance:\n • Both works tackle different facets of LLM reliability and trustworthiness.  \n • The first paper zeroes in on bias detection without needing curated test sets, while the second deals with proactive defenses against misuse or malicious exploitation.  \n • Together, they highlight how analyzing or intervening in a model’s internal representations can be an effective strategy for both fairness (bias detection) and safety (jailbreak defense).\n\nIf you have particular details you’d like to explore—such as experimental setups, metrics, code implementation, or compatibility with specific LLM architectures—feel free to let me know!",

I’d like to suggest adding two highly relevant papers along with some additional details that could be useful for researchers and practitioners browsing the collection.\n\n1. Evaluate Bias without Manual Test Sets: A Concept Representation Perspective for LLMs  \n • Link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15524  \n • Venue: arXiv  \n • Classification: A5. Fairness  \n • Model: LLM  \n • Summary: This paper introduces BiasLens, a novel framework designed for bias evaluation in large language models that doesn’t rely on manually curated test sets. Instead, the approach utilizes Concept Activation Vectors (CAV) alongside Sparse Autoencoders. The key innovation is that it projects internal representations onto concept directions, which can serve as proxies for social and demographic biases. This not only reduces the manual effort required to develop exhaustive test sets but also provides a more systematic and data-driven method to uncover hidden biases within LLMs. The framework may offer new perspectives for fairness evaluations and could integrate well with other fairness and bias analysis tools in your repo.\n\n2. Shaping the Safety Boundaries: Understanding and Defending Against Jailbreaks in Large Language Models  \n • Link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17034  \n • Venue: ACL 2025 Main  \n • Classification: A1. Jailbreak  \n • Model: LLM  \n • Summary: The paper presents Activation Boundary Defense (ABD), a strategy aimed at mitigating jailbreak attacks in large language models. Jailbreak attacks, which force the model to produce harmful or off-guideline outputs, are a critical concern in deploying safe AI systems. ABD works by constraining the model’s neural activations within predefined safety boundaries. This technique is particularly innovative because it tackles the issue at the representation level, ensuring that even during adversarial attempts, the model’s internal states remain within safe operational limits. This work adds an important angle on AI security and could complement existing methods that focus on post-hoc filtering or prompt engineering.\n\nBy incorporating both these papers, your repo would not only offer leading-edge methods for evaluating bias without the heavy reliance on test sets but also address crucial security challenges by preventing jailbreak attacks at the activation level. Both contributions enhance the current landscape of research related to fairness and safety in LLMs.\n\nMany thanks again for all your support and for curating such an excellent resource. I hope these detailed descriptions provide enough context for considering their inclusion.

Evaluate Bias without Manual Test Sets: A Concept Representation Perspective for LLMs\n\n- **Paper:** [arXiv:2505.15524](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15524)  \n- **Venue:** arXiv preprint  \n- **Classification:** A5. Fairness  \n- **Model:** Large Language Models (LLMs)  \n- **Code:** Currently no publicly available code  \n- **Main Contribution:**  \n  This paper introduces **BiasLens**, a novel bias evaluation framework that does not rely on manually annotated test sets. Traditionally, evaluating biases in large language models (LLMs) involves manually curated benchmark datasets, which can be both costly and limited in scope. To address this, BiasLens leverages **Concept Activation Vectors (CAVs)** and **Sparse Autoencoders** to automatically detect and measure biases within LLMs.\n\n- **Key Innovations:**\n  - **Test-set-free bias evaluation:** Eliminates the need for manually curated bias test sets, allowing scalable and automatic bias evaluations.\n  - **Concept Activation Vectors (CAVs):** Utilizes CAVs to represent high-level semantic concepts (e.g., gender, racial identity) within the LLM’s hidden state space.\n  - **Sparse Autoencoders:** Employs sparse autoencoders to identify and isolate the latent dimensions corresponding to specific biased concepts.\n  - **Bias quantification:** Provides a systematic metric for quantifying biases in LLM representations, enabling comparisons across models and training paradigms.\n\n- **Potential Impact and Relevance:**  \n  The BiasLens framework significantly reduces the overhead of bias evaluation and provides a scalable, generalizable method to systematically measure and track biases in LLMs. By circumventing the reliance on manual annotation, BiasLens enables continuous evaluation of biases as models evolve, ensuring a more robust and fair deployment of language technologies.\n\n---\n\n### 2\\. Shaping the Safety Boundaries: Understanding and Defending Against Jailbreaks in Large Language Models\n\n- **Paper:** [arXiv:2412.17034](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17034)  \n- **Venue:** ACL 2025 Main Conference (accepted paper)  \n- **Classification:** A1. Jailbreak  \n- **Model:** Large Language Models (LLMs)  \n- **Code:** Currently no publicly available code  \n- **Main Contribution:**  \n  This work focuses on a critical security vulnerability known as \"jailbreaking,\" where adversaries craft carefully designed prompts that cause LLMs to bypass their safety mechanisms and generate unsafe or prohibited content. To address this problem, the authors propose the **Activation Boundary Defense (ABD)** method, a novel defense strategy explicitly designed to mitigate jailbreak attacks.\n\n- **Key Innovations:**\n  - **Activation Boundary Defense (ABD):** Introduces an approach that constrains model activations within predefined \"safety boundaries,\" effectively preventing model outputs from drifting into unsafe regions due to adversarial prompts.\n  - **Activation space analysis:** Provides an in-depth analysis and visualization of how jailbreak attacks affect the internal activation space of LLMs, enhancing our understanding of jailbreak vulnerabilities.\n  - **Robustness improvements:** Demonstrates empirically that ABD significantly reduces successful jailbreak attempts compared to previous methods, while minimally impacting general model performance.\n  - **Practical recommendations:** Offers actionable insights and practical recommendations for researchers and practitioners on how to better protect LLM deployments against jailbreak attacks.\n\n- **Potential Impact and Relevance:**  \n  Jailbreak vulnerabilities pose a significant risk for real-world applications of LLMs. By directly addressing this threat through activation-based defenses, the paper provides a practical and theoretically sound approach to safeguard models against adversarial exploitation. The ABD framework is expected to become a valuable toolset for model developers aiming to build safer and more reliable AI systems for general deployment.\n\n---\n\nI hope this provides the additional clarity and details you were seeking.

Fork the repo (if you have not already).\n2. Create a new branch (e.g., “add-papers-bias-jailbreak”).\n3. Open the README (or wherever the paper table is maintained) in your text editor.\n4. Paste the new rows in the correct section of the table, making sure that the formatting aligns with existing content.\n5. Commit and push your changes.\n6. Create a pull request. Provide a clear title (e.g., “Add two papers on bias evaluation and jailbreak defenses”) and a brief description (e.g., “This PR adds two relevant papers dealing with bias detection and jailbreak mitigation.”).\n\nAs for your mention of your small business being under attack, if you mean you are facing a cybersecurity issue (e.g., targeted phishing attempts, denial-of-service, hacking attempts), below are a few high-level recommendations to help you “survive” and strengthen your defenses:\n\n• Identify the Nature of the Attack: Gather logs, alerts, or error messages to understand whether it is a ransomware, DDoS, phishing, or another type of attack.\n\n• Contact Professionals: If the threat is severe, consider reaching out to IT security experts or cybersecurity firms. Quick action can mitigate damage.\n\n• Patch and Update Systems: Ensure that operating systems, devices, and any plugins you use (like CMS add-ons) are up to date. Apply security patches promptly.\n\n• Backup Critical Data: Maintain regular, secure offline backups. This will help you recover more easily if your data is compromised.\n\n• Educate Team Members: Human error is often the weakest link in security. Regularly train employees to spot phishing attempts or suspicious downloads.\n\n• Implement Firewall and Anti-Malware: At minimum, use reputable endpoint security tools and a strong firewall to help detect and block malicious access.\n\n• Have a Response Plan: Outline clear steps (both technical and non-technical) for how to react if systems go down or are breached.\n\nIf you suspect more complex or repeated attacks, consult specialized security agencies or local law enforcement, as appropriate for your region and the severity of the threat.\n\nHopefully this helps you both add those important papers to your AI-related repository and take some steps to secure your small business from attacks.

          "response": "It looks like you’ve received—or are considering sending—a message from someone who’s contributing to an open‐source repository (or research repository) focused on large language models (LLMs). The message does a few things:\n\n1. It starts with a friendly greeting and a thank‐you note to the repo maintainers for their work. This is a common courtesy in open-source and research communities.\n\n2. The contributor then suggests adding two new papers that are relevant to the repository. The suggestion is organized in a clear table that lists each paper’s title, a link (to the arXiv version), the venue, classification, the model focus, and a brief comment on what each paper introduces. Here’s a brief rundown of each paper:\n\n a. “Evaluate Bias without Manual Test Sets: A Concept Representation Perspective for LLMs”\n  • Link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15524  \n  • Venue: Marked as arXiv (indicating preprint status), and it's categorized under fairness (A5. Fairness).\n  • Content: The paper introduces BiasLens, a framework that evaluates bias in LLMs without the need for manually curated test sets. Instead, it leverages Concept Activation Vectors (CAVs) and Sparse Autoencoders to detect biases, thus providing a more scalable and test-set-free evaluation approach.\n\n b. “Shaping the Safety Boundaries: Understanding and Defending Against Jailbreaks in Large Language Models”\n  • Link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17034  \n  • Venue: ACL 2025 Main (suggesting it targets a significant conference focused on computational linguistics/AI safety)\n  • Content: This paper introduces Activation Boundary Defense (ABD), a method aimed at mitigating jailbreak attacks. Jailbreak attacks involve manipulating an LLM to produce outputs that disregard its safety guidelines. ABD works by constraining the model’s internal activations within safe bounds, effectively reducing the risk of the model being coerced into unsafe behaviors.\n\n3. The overall tone thanks the maintainers again for their support and contributions, indicating ongoing engagement with the community.\n\nIf your business or project is “under attack” in the sense that you’re facing challenges (perhaps from adversarial inputs, misuse of AI, or simply the competitive pressures of maintaining high standards for fairness and security in LLMs), incorporating research like this can bolster your defenses. BiasLens helps ensure your model isn’t biased, and ABD strengthens the model against manipulative or dangerous prompts—both key to maintaining trust and operational integrity.\n\nIn summary, the contributor is offering two state-of-the-art methods that may help improve your models’ robustness, fairness, and safety. This could be particularly valuable if you’re dealing with issues around bias or misuse (jailbreak attacks) which might be “attacks” on the integrity of your services, potentially impacting user trust and business operations.\n\nIf you need further advice on how to integrate these ideas or evaluate their readiness for your use case, please let me know what specific aspects you’d like to dive into!",

It includes a quick overview of each paper’s contributions, how they fit into typical security/safety/bias-related research categories, and suggestions for describing them in a pull request or README update. \n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n1) Evaluate Bias without Manual Test Sets: A Concept Representation Perspective for LLMs\n\n   • Core Idea: Proposes “BiasLens,” a framework to detect and measure bias in large language models (LLMs) without relying on manual or curated test sets.  \n   • Methodology: Leverages Concept Activation Vectors (CAVs) and Sparse Autoencoders to represent specific “concepts” (e.g., gender, ethnicity, profession) that may introduce model bias.  \n   • Why It’s Useful:  \n     – Removes the need for manually labeled or constructed data, which can be time-consuming.  \n     – Potentially identifies latent biases by examining neuron activations tied to certain concepts.  \n     – Provides a more flexible and scalable bias-evaluation method than “fixed” test sets.  \n   • Potential Applications:  \n     – Routine bias audits in production LLMs.  \n     – Exploratory analysis of model sensitivity to demographic concepts.  \n     – Incorporation into continuous integration pipelines for fairness checks.  \n   • Classification / Tags: A5. Fairness; LLM.  \n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n2) Shaping the Safety Boundaries: Understanding and Defending Against Jailbreaks in Large Language Models\n\n   • Core Idea: Addresses “jailbreaks,” where users craft clever prompts or manipulative inputs to break through an LLM’s safety filters. The paper introduces “Activation Boundary Defense” (ABD) to limit network activations within predefined safety boundaries.  \n   • Methodology:  \n     – Identifies “unsafe” activation patterns empirically.  \n     – Implements constraints (e.g., gating functions or gradient-based “corrections”) to keep activations from crossing critical thresholds.  \n   • Why It’s Useful:  \n     – Jailbreak attacks are a fundamental security risk for LLM-based applications, making it crucial to have robust mitigations.  \n     – The ABD approach demonstrates a structured, internal model-based method of controlling outputs, rather than only relying on external content filters.  \n   • Potential Applications:  \n     – Real-world production systems that must minimize risk of harmful or policy-violating responses.  \n     – Future research into safe fine-tuning or layered defenses (e.g., combining policy filtering + boundary-based constraints).  \n   • Classification / Tags: A1.

I would like to propose including two highly relevant papers that focus on bias detection and prevention of jailbreak attacks in Large Language Models (LLMs):\n\n1. Evaluate Bias without Manual Test Sets: A Concept Representation Perspective for LLMs  \n   • Link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15524  \n   • Venue: arXiv  \n   • Classification: A5. Fairness  \n   • Summary: This paper introduces BiasLens, a novel framework for evaluating bias in LLMs without the need for manually created test sets. By leveraging Concept Activation Vectors and Sparse Autoencoders, BiasLens provides an efficient and test-set-free mechanism to detect subtle biases in model outputs.\n\n2. Shaping the Safety Boundaries: Understanding and Defending Against Jailbreaks in Large Language Models  \n   • Link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17034  \n   • Venue: ACL 2025 Main  \n   • Classification: A1. Jailbreak  \n   • Summary: This work proposes Activation Boundary Defense (ABD), a technique designed to constrain an LLM’s internal activations within designated safety boundaries. The method helps mitigate jailbreak attacks by monitoring and adjusting model behavior in real time.\n\nThese two papers address critical aspects of LLM development and deployment—namely, fairness and security. Adding them would greatly enhance the repository’s coverage of state-of-the-art ideas in bias detection and robust safety strategies. I appreciate your support and hope these contributions prove valuable in expanding the resource.\n\nThank you for your consideration!\n─────────────────────────────────────────────────",

Both papers are highly relevant and would make excellent additions to any repo focused on LLM safety, fairness, and robustness. Here’s a brief summary and suggested formatting to include them:\n\n---\n\n### 1. **Evaluate Bias without Manual Test Sets: A Concept Representation Perspective for LLMs**  \n- **Link:** [arXiv:2505.15524](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15524)  \n- **Code:** –  \n- **Venue:** arXiv  \n- **Classification:** A5. Fairness  \n- **Model:** LLM  \n- **Comment:** Proposes BiasLens, a test-set-free bias evaluation framework using Concept Activation Vectors and Sparse Autoencoders to detect biases in LLMs.\n\n**Summary:**  \nThis paper introduces BiasLens, a framework for evaluating bias in language models without relying on curated, manual test sets. By leveraging concept activation vectors (CAVs) and sparse autoencoders, BiasLens can systematically identify and quantify biases in the internal representations of LLMs. This approach offers a scalable and interpretable alternative to traditional bias evaluation, which often suffers from limited coverage and manual effort.\n\n---\n\n### 2. **Shaping the Safety Boundaries: Understanding and Defending Against Jailbreaks in Large Language Models**  \n- **Link:** [arXiv:2412.17034](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17034)  \n- **Code:** –  \n- **Venue:** ACL 2025 Main  \n- **Classification:** A1. Jailbreak  \n- **Model:** LLM  \n- **Comment:** Introduces Activation Boundary Defense (ABD), a method to constrain activations within safety boundaries, effectively mitigating jailbreak attacks.\n\n**Summary:**  \nThis paper analyzes the mechanisms behind jailbreak attacks on LLMs and proposes Activation Boundary Defense (ABD), a defense mechanism that enforces safety by constraining the model’s activations to remain within predefined safe boundaries. ABD demonstrates strong empirical results against a range of jailbreak prompts, providing a promising direction for increasing LLM robustness and aligning outputs with safety requirements.\n\n---\n\n**How to Add to Your Repo:**\nYou can simply copy-paste the above rows into your markdown table, or if you use a `.csv` or `.md` file, ensure the formatting matches your repo style.  \nIf you’d like, I can generate a pull request template or the actual markdown code for you.\n\nLet me know if you’d like any further help, such as providing more context, summaries, or related work for these papers!",

          "response": "Thank you for sharing these suggestions! Both papers address highly relevant challenges in contemporary LLM research—one focuses on systematically identifying biases without relying on hand-curated test sets, and the other tackles the question of how to constrain model activations to mitigate jailbreak scenarios. Below are a few thoughts on each work:\n\n1. Evaluate Bias without Manual Test Sets: A Concept Representation Perspective for LLMs (arXiv:2505.15524)  \n   • What it adds: Proposes a new “test-set-free” approach (BiasLens) that leverages Concept Activation Vectors (which encode abstract concepts in internal model activations) as well as Sparse Autoencoders to detect hidden biases.  \n   • Why it’s interesting: Typical bias evaluations rely heavily on curated test sets or synthetic prompts, which can miss subtle or emergent biases. This approach could provide a more generalizable and flexible framework for bias detection in large models, especially as LLMs evolve.\n\n2. Shaping the Safety Boundaries: Understanding and Defending Against Jailbreaks in Large Language Models (arXiv:2412.17034)  \n   • What it adds: Proposes Activation Boundary Defense (ABD), a mechanism to restrict model activations within “safe” ranges.  \n   • Why it’s interesting: Jailbreak prompts continue to be a pressing concern, especially in situations where safe or compliant responses are mandatory. Methods like ABD that constrain or monitor activation space could be among the next generation of solutions for LLM safety.\n\nAdding These to Your Repo\n• Classification:  \n  – The first paper falls under “A5. Fairness” (your classification) since it provides a framework for bias detection.  \n  – The second clearly aligns with “A1. Jailbreak” due to its focus on adversarial attacks and defenses.  \n• Comments/Notes:  \n  – Linking them next to other LLM-focused papers on bias, safety, or model interpretability would show a clear picture of the current research landscape.  \n  – Because both are arXiv preprints, it’s straightforward to include direct links and keep an eye out for updated versions.  \n\nIt’s always great to see more research tackling these critical areas—fairness, interpretability, and security—head-on. If you integrate these, they should further solidify your repo as a central resource for LLM safety and ethics research.\n\nAgain, thanks for sending these over, and let me know if there’s anything else I can help with regarding these additions or related topics!",

I'm glad you found the repo valuable and that you were able to catch the presentation at DefCon last year.\n\nBoth papers you listed are indeed interesting and touch on crucial issues in the LLM space:\n\n1. \"Evaluate Bias without Manual Test Sets: A Concept Representation Perspective for LLMs\" – This work tackles bias evaluation without relying on handcrafted test sets by leveraging Concept Activation Vectors and Sparse Autoencoders, forming what they refer to as BiasLens. It’s an innovative approach since it sidesteps the need for manual dataset curation and offers an automatic, systematic technique to detect biases. This kind of framework can potentially scale well and reduce human overhead in bias detection.\n\n2. \"Shaping the Safety Boundaries: Understanding and Defending Against Jailbreaks in Large Language Models\" – This paper introduces the Activation Boundary Defense (ABD), which focuses on confining activations within defined safety boundaries as a way to mitigate jailbreak attacks. In a time when jailbreak techniques are constantly evolving, having a defense mechanism that works by regulating activations could be very valuable for enhancing LLM safety without overly compromising model performance.\n\nI’ll definitely consider adding these to the repository. They both align well with the repo’s focus on fairness and security in LLMs, and having them listed would benefit users looking for state-of-the-art methods to evaluate bias and secure models against adversarial exploits.\n\nThanks again for your contribution and support.

However, I can confirm that your suggestion appears well-formatted and includes valuable information that would likely be beneficial to add to the collection. The repository maintainers will be able to review your suggestion and decide on including these papers.\n\nThank you for contributing to the improvement of this resource!",

Encoding Multi-line Values:\nXML attributes (such as value=\"...\") are typically not designed for multi-line or complex content, especially with markdown tables. If your system supports it, consider enclosing the content within an element instead. For example:\n\n<?xml version=\"1.0\"?>\n<configuration>\n  <request_handler>\n    Hi, thank you for maintaining this great repo!\n    I would like to suggest adding the following two highly relevant papers to the repo:\n\n    | Title | Link | Code | Venue | Classification | Model | Comment |\n    | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- |\n    | Evaluate Bias without Manual Test Sets: A Concept Representation Perspective for LLMs | [arXiv:2505.15524](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15524) | - | arXiv  | A5.

Escaping Special Characters:\nIf you must use attributes for multi-line or special content, ensure you escape special XML characters (like & and <). For example, & becomes &amp;, < becomes &lt;, etc.\n\n3. Consistency:\nYour current configuration is valid, assuming your system can process multi-line attribute values. If not, use element content as in the example above.\n\n4. Purpose:\nYour message is well-written and clear for a maintainer. If you want to generate a PR or issue automatically, consider formatting the content accordingly in your bot logic.\n\nSummary:\n- For best practice and XML compliance, use child elements (like <request_handler>...</request_handler>) for multi-line or complex content.\n- Your paper suggestions are clear and well-formatted for human readers.\n\nIf you specify the system or context where this XML will be used, I can further tailor the advice!",
