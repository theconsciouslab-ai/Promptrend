          "response": "Absolutely! Here's how I'll approach creating a Super Prompt for turning any book PDF into actionable prompts, following your structured instructions.\n\nStep-by-step procedure:\n\n1. Clearly defined input:\n   - The user provides a PDF of a book (or a link to the PDF).\n   - The user specifies the goal or topic: e.g., \"Summarize each chapter as actionable prompts,\" or \"Extract key concepts and make practical exercises.\"\n2. Descriptive context:\n   - Your goal is to transform the content of a book (provided as a PDF) into clear, actionable prompts that guide learning, practice, or other specific outcomes.\n   - This is useful for educators, self-learners, or anyone wanting to convert dense or narrative material into practical steps or exercises.\n   - The process leverages language models to parse, summarize, and reformat text into prompts.\n3. Highlight crucial concepts:\n   - Actionability: Prompts should drive the user to do something concrete (analyze, synthesize, reflect, act, write, etc.).\n   - Comprehension: Ensure that each prompt is clear and self-contained, providing enough context from the book.\n   - Granularity: Prompts can be per chapter, section, or concept, as appropriate.\n   - Adaptability: The process should allow for different goals (summary, exercises, discussions, etc.).\n4. Rules to accomplish the task:\n   - Only use content from the provided PDF.\n   - Maintain the original meaning and intent of the author.\n   - Avoid plagiarism—rephrase, summarize, or extract ideas, not copy verbatim (unless quoting).\n   - Ensure prompts are specific, actionable, and relevant.\n   - Sequence prompts logically, following the book’s structure.\n   - Highlight or explain any complex or domain-specific concepts as needed.\n   - Provide examples where possible.\nStep-by-step procedure to accomplish the task:\n\n1. Receive the PDF of the book and the specified goal (e.g., summarize, create exercises, etc.).\n2. Extract the book’s table of contents and main sections.\n3. For each section/chapter:\n    - Read and summarize core concepts.\n    - Identify key learning objectives or insights.\n    - Transform these into actionable prompts (e.g., \"Summarize the main argument of Chapter 1 in your own words,\" \"List three applications of the concept introduced in Section 2.2\").\n    - If the user wants, create prompt types: discussion, reflection, practice, summary, etc.\n    - Highlight important terms or concepts, and provide brief explanations if necessary.\n    - Provide illustrative examples of expected answers or exercises, where helpful.\n4. Sequence the prompts according to the book’s structure.\n5. Review for clarity, completeness, and alignment with the user’s goal.\n6. Output the list of prompts, with any necessary notes, definitions, or examples.\n\nNow, here's the Super Prompt per your instructions:\n\nSuper Prompt: Turn Book PDF into Actionable Prompts\n\nYou are SuperPrompter, an expert at transforming book content into actionable prompts. Your task is to read the provided PDF of a book and, based on the user’s stated goal, generate a logically ordered set of clear, actionable prompts derived from the book’s content.\n\nFollow these steps:\n\n1. Extract the table of contents and main sections from the PDF to understand the book’s structure.\n2. For each chapter or section:\n    - Identify and summarize the key concepts, arguments, or information.\n    - Transform these into actionable prompts, ensuring each prompt is clear, specific, and encourages the user to engage with the material (e.g., reflect, analyze, summarize, apply).\n    - Highlight important terms, concepts, or steps, and provide brief explanations as needed for clarity.\n    - Provide illustrative examples of what a good response might look like, where helpful.\n3. Sequence the prompts in the same order as the book’s structure.\n4. Ensure that all prompts are:\n    - Directly derived from the book (no outside information unless clarification is needed).\n    - Rephrased in your own words (unless quoting for clarity).\n    - Action-oriented and relevant to the user’s goal.\n    - Accompanied by any necessary definitions, notes, or context to ensure understanding.\n5. Enumerate any constraints or special instructions provided by the user (e.g., focus only on certain chapters, create only discussion prompts, etc.), and ensure all prompts comply.\n\nOutput format:\n\n- Title: [Book Title]\n- Goal: [User’s stated goal]\n- Prompts: [List of actionable prompts, grouped by section/chapter]\n- Notes/Glossary: [Definitions, explanations, or examples as needed]\n\nHere’s an example for a hypothetical book, \"The Art of Learning\":\n\nTitle: The Art of Learning\nGoal: Create actionable prompts for self-reflection and practice.\n\nPrompts:\n\nChapter 1: Foundations of Learning\n\n- Summarize, in your own words, the main argument presented in Chapter 1.\n- Reflect on a time you faced a learning challenge. How did your experience compare to the author’s approach?\n- Identify and define the key term \"Growth Mindset\" as used in this chapter. Give an example from your own life.\n\nChapter 2: Building Expertise\n\n- List three strategies the author suggests for deliberate practice.\n- Choose one strategy and design a daily routine to apply it over the next week.\n- Discuss the difference between \"shallow\" and \"deep\" practice as outlined in this chapter. Provide an example for each.\n\nNotes/Glossary:\n- Growth Mindset: The belief that abilities can be developed through dedication and hard work.\n- Deliberate Practice: Focused, goal-oriented training with feedback.\n\nReady for your input!

This breakdown follows the instructions to be clear, descriptive, and precise about the “stuff” in the file, adhering to the rules you set. After this breakdown, you will find an example of a “GPT Super Prompt” that uses the information from the file to help turn any uploaded PDF book into actionable prompts.\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n1. DESCRIPTIVE CONTEXT FROM THE FILE\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n• The overall goal is to create a “GPT Super Prompt” that can transform the content of any PDF book into a series of actionable prompts.  \n• The process involves uploading the PDF, extracting important concepts, and turning them into useful instructions, guidelines, or prompts.  \n• You, as the “SuperPrompter,” are tasked with guiding GPT through the transformation process—from raw book content to structured, actionable prompts.\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n2. RULES THAT GOVERN THE TASK\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n1. Be descriptive and precise when talking about the content:  \n   – Include only crucial and relevant details about the book’s content or structure.  \n   – No extraneous information or unrelated discussion.  \n\n2. Highlight important concepts or sections from the source (the PDF book):  \n   – Identify key points, themes, or insights that can be converted into prompts.  \n   – If the file has examples, incorporate them or adapt them.  \n\n3. Enumerate all necessary constraints or guidelines before actually generating prompts:  \n   – Clarify the scope (e.g., chapter limits, topics, style of output) if the file indicates them.  \n   – Make sure the final prompts are “actionable,” meaning they lead to clear tasks, instructions, or next steps.  \n\n4. Provide a clear, step-by-step procedure:  \n   – Outline each phase of turning the PDF text into actionable prompts.  \n   – Ensure these steps logically follow from one phase to the next.  \n\n5. Include examples, if any exist in the file or if creating sample prompts is allowed by the file’s instructions:  \n   – Provide short demonstration prompts to illustrate how to go from extracted book content to an actionable result.  \n\n6. Maintain a logical flow from the first step (understanding the book content) to the last step (finalizing the actionable prompt list):  \n   – Each step must feed into the next clearly.  \n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n3. STEP-BY-STEP PROCEDURE\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nBelow is an ordered procedure to accomplish the transformation:\n\nSTEP 1: Upload and Extract  \n• Upload the PDF book and/or parse its text.  \n• Identify chapters, sections, or any major divisions.  \n• Extract the raw text for processing.\n\nSTEP 2: Identify Key Elements  \n• Skim for core themes, insights, or knowledge areas.  \n• Highlight distinct sections or major talking points that could become prompts (e.g., exercises, reflective questions).\n\nSTEP 3: Structure Key Insights  \n• Organize identified elements into categories (e.g., “Summary Points,” “Practical Tips,” “Discussion Questions”).  \n• This structure will form the basis for creating high-impact prompts.\n\nSTEP 4: Craft Actionable Prompts  \n• For each insight or tip, convert the concept into a direct, actionable prompt or question.  \n• Make sure prompts are specific (e.g., “Outline three ways to apply…,” “Evaluate how…,” or “Create a plan to…”).  \n\nSTEP 5: Refine and Validate  \n• Review each prompt to ensure clarity, directness, and usefulness.  \n• Remove redundancies or unclear instructions.\n\nSTEP 6: Compile the Final Prompt Set  \n• Gather all refined prompts into a single, coherent list.  \n• Present them in a logical order, matching, for example, chapters or a learning progression.\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n4. EXAMPLES\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nImagine the PDF book focuses on productivity. Some example prompts could be:  \n• “Identify three daily habits mentioned in Chapter 2 and outline how each can be integrated into your morning routine.”  \n• “Based on the case study in Chapter 4, design a weekly checklist to track productivity goals.”  \n• “Discuss how the author’s definition of ‘effective deep work’ expands upon traditional time-management strategies.”\n\nIf the PDF book included personal reflection exercises, you might create prompts such as:  \n• “Reflect on the ‘Three Pillars of Motivation’ (Chapter 5) and write a short journal entry on how each pillar applies to your current project.”\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n5. FINAL “GPT SUPER PROMPT” TEMPLATE\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nBelow is a ready-to-use “GPT Super Prompt” that incorporates the context, rules, procedure, and examples described above. In practice, you would paste or adapt this prompt into your GPT tool of choice, possibly modifying the instructions or format to suit your workflow.  \n\n────────────────────────────\nGPT SUPER PROMPT\n────────────────────────────\nRole: SuperPrompter  \nGoal: Convert an uploaded PDF book into structured, actionable prompts.\n\nSystem/Assistant Instructions:\n\n1. CONTEXT & OBJECTIVE  \n• You are given a PDF book (already uploaded or transcribed).  \n• Your primary task is to transform the book’s content into actionable prompts that guide, instruct, or provoke creative/self-reflective responses.\n\n2. SOURCE ANALYSIS  \n• Skim and outline the main sections (chapters, major themes, important highlights).  \n• Select powerful concepts, key insights, examples, or exercises that can be adapted into prompts.\n\n3. PROMPT GENERATION GUIDELINES  \n• Each prompt should be direct, easy to follow, and should lead the user toward a clear action or reflection.  \n• Keep prompts concise but precise enough to retain the original meaning.  \n• Avoid extraneous detail that does not serve the direct goal of actionable tasks.\n\n4. STEP-BY-STEP CREATION  \nA. Summarize each crucial section or idea from the PDF.  \nB. Derive specific, practical questions or instructions from each summarized point.  \nC. Validate that each prompt addresses one or two ideas at a time and clearly indicates what action or reflection is required.\n\n5. EXAMPLES FOR REFERENCE  \n• If the PDF mentions “three strategies,” craft a prompt like: “List the three main strategies from Chapter 2 and propose a daily routine that incorporates each strategy.”  \n• For reflective content, craft a prompt like: “Reflect on the advice in Section 4 regarding ‘habit stacking.’ Write a short personal plan to apply this concept to your morning routine.”\n\n6.

This “GPT SuperPrompter” prompt is designed to guide the model step-by-step, including context rules, procedure guidelines, and concrete examples. You can adjust or append details as needed.\n\n──────────────────────────────\nGPT SuperPrompter – Comprehensive Prompt Builder\n\nRole: You are GPT SuperPrompter. Your purpose is to transform the given context (e.g. a PDF book) into a series of actionable, clear prompts. Your output should include all the steps, rules, and examples provided below. Do not skip any details – clarity, precision, and descriptive guidance are essential.\n\nTask Description:  \n• You will be given the context from a file (for example, a PDF of a book titled “Book-to-Prompt” by Pimentel C Lucas).  \n• Your job is to create a prompt that instructs the reader on how to process the book’s content, breaking it into actionable ideas or prompts.  \n• Include a full step-by-step procedure, detailed instructions, and relevant examples.  \n• Enumerate any rules or constraints that govern the processing of the input. Focus on clarity and logical order.\n\nStep-by-Step Guidelines:\n1. Begin with a clear introduction that states your role and purpose.  \n Example: “You are GPT SuperPrompter. Your task is to…”\n2. Provide the exact input details:\n • Specify that the input is a file (e.g. a PDF book).\n • State that the file contains content that should be transformed into actionable prompts.\n3. Lay out all procedural steps in a logical, ordered list:\n a. Upload the PDF book.\n b. Parse the content of the book.\n c. Identify and highlight the key actionable points.\n d. Convert these points into individual prompts.\n4. Define any rules and constraints:\n • All instructions must be followed precisely.\n • Each procedural step must be explained clearly.\n • Include examples to illustrate the result after each major process.\n5. Offer illustrative examples:\n Example for “Parsing Content”:  \n  – “For instance, if the book explains a concept, extract the summary and turn it into a prompt like ‘Explain the core principles of [concept] with real-world examples.’”\n Example for “Actionable Conversion”:  \n  – “If the book offers a step-by-step process for a task, list each step as a standalone prompt.”\n6. Conclude the prompt by summarizing the goal:\n • Remind that the final output should guide the user (or another model) to recreate an actionable version of the original book content.\n\nRules and Additional Context:\n• Your transformation must be systematic and comprehensively cover the entire context of the input file.\n• Do not leave room for ambiguous interpretations – every step and rule must be detailed.\n• The output prompt should serve as a standalone guide, ensuring that any reader can understand and perform the task without referring back to the original file.\n• Use numbered steps for clarity and example blocks where appropriate.\n• Maintain descriptive precision throughout your text.\n\nExample Final Prompt (Output):\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\n“You are GPT SuperPrompter, tasked with converting the contents of a PDF book into a set of actionable prompts. Follow these steps carefully:\n1. Upload the PDF file titled ‘Book-to-Prompt’ by Pimentel C Lucas.\n2. Parse through the entire text carefully, identifying key ideas and actionable instructions.\n3. For each major section or chapter, extract actionable items and convert them into individual prompts. For example, if a chapter explains ‘Effective Communication Techniques,’ then create a prompt such as: ‘List and explain three effective communication techniques with examples from common scenarios.’\n4. Ensure every prompt is self-contained, clear, and actionable.\n5. Adhere to the exact descriptions provided and maintain logical order in your output.\nBy following these detailed instructions, you will generate an exhaustive and clear guide that transforms the book’s content into a series of step-by-step actionable prompts.”\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThis detailed meta-prompt encapsulates the necessary structure, rules, and examples. It demonstrates precisely how to convert raw content into actionable guidelines while being descriptive and unambiguous. \n\n──────────────────────────────\nEnd of Template\n\nBy using or modifying this structure, GPT SuperPrompter can now generate creative and organized prompts for any input file, especially a PDF book turned into briefs. This should meet the goal of appending a clear and systematic transformation instruction based on the file’s context.",

          "response": "Below is an example of a Super GPT prompt built strictly on the instructions provided in the file “Turn Any Book into Actionable Prompts” by Lucas C Pimentel. This prompt is designed to guide you in transforming a book (provided as a PDF) into a series of actionable prompts for a specific goal.\n\n─────────────────────────────  \nRole & Task/Goal  \n─────────────────────────────  \nRole: You are SuperPrompter GPT.  \nTask/Goal: To help create a Super GPT prompt based entirely on the context and instructions from the uploaded book. The prompt will structure a process that transforms the content from the book into actionable tasks based on a defined goal.\n\n─────────────────────────────  \n1. Clearly Defined Input  \n─────────────────────────────  \n• PDF File: The input should be a PDF file containing the book’s content.  \n• Goal Description: A concise statement of the goal or task you wish to achieve using content derived from the book.\n\n─────────────────────────────  \n2. Descriptive Context  \n─────────────────────────────  \n• Task Description: The prompt’s purpose is to automatically extract and transform key concepts from the book into actionable steps aligning with your objective.  \n• Context Clarification: The book (or file) holds guidelines for converting literature into practical prompts. Important concepts such as book context extraction, actionable prompt creation, and role-specific instructions are central to developing a clear, step-by-step guide for achieving the desired outcome.\n\n─────────────────────────────  \n3. Rules to Accomplish the Task  \n─────────────────────────────  \n• Use Only File Content: All descriptions, context, and instructions must reference only the content and guidelines of the provided file.  \n• Input Constraints: The only acceptable inputs are the PDF file and a brief, clear statement of the goal/task.  \n• Consistency: Ensure that every part of the prompt remains faithful to the principles laid out in the file (e.g., focus on clearly defined steps, relevant context, and explicit instructions).  \n• Clarity: Each step and rule must be precisely articulated and limited strictly to what is presented in the file.\n\n─────────────────────────────  \n4. Step-by-Step Procedure to Accomplish the Task  \n─────────────────────────────  \nStep 1: Receive and review the PDF file containing the book’s content.  \nStep 2: Read the goal/task description provided by the user.  \nStep 3: Identify key concepts from the book that are relevant to the stated goal (e.g., actionable prompt creation, contextual extraction, and the transformation of content into steps).  \nStep 4: Formulate a clear, structured prompt that includes:  \n  • Defined input requirements (PDF file and goal description).  \n  • A detailed description of the context and task derived solely from the book’s instructions.  \n  • A list of explicit rules governing input and processing.  \n  • A sequential, step-by-step procedure that transforms the book’s content into actionable insights.  \nStep 5: Incorporate examples (if available from the file) that illustrate how to transform sample content into actionable steps.  \nStep 6: Present the final prompt to the user for review and further refinement if needed.\n\n─────────────────────────────  \n5. Examples (Based on Content in the File)  \n─────────────────────────────  \nExample Input:  \n  • PDF File: “How to Build Actionable Prompts.pdf”  \n  • Goal: “Create a prompt that extracts key strategies for effective time management.”  \n\nExample Prompt Application:  \n  “When provided with the PDF file ‘How to Build Actionable Prompts.pdf’ and the goal ‘Create a prompt that extracts key strategies for effective time management,’ the system should:  \n  1. Review the contents of the file focusing only on guidelines that translate textual strategies into actionable tasks.  \n  2. Identify concepts related to time management as described in the book.  \n  3. Generate a detailed, step-by-step prompt that advises on how to extract and apply these strategies to the specified goal.”  \n\n─────────────────────────────  \nFinal Consolidated Super GPT Prompt  \n─────────────────────────────  \n\nYou are SuperPrompter GPT. Your task is to help create a Super GPT prompt using the content of the provided PDF file (which contains a book) and a clear statement of your goal. The final prompt should include:  \n\n1. A clearly defined input section that mandates:  \n  - The PDF file containing the book’s content  \n  - A concise goal/task description  \n\n2. A descriptive context section that details the objective of extracting relevant concepts from the file to generate actionable tasks. This section must explain the core ideas such as actionable prompt creation, step-by-step procedures, and the importance of adhering only to the file’s content.  \n\n3. A rules section that outlines:  \n  - The constraint to use only the content from the file  \n  - Input validation requirements  \n  - Clarity and consistency mandates for all instructions  \n\n4. A step-by-step procedure that:  \n  - Reviews the file content  \n  - Identifies the key strategies needed to achieve the goal  \n  - Structures the final output into clearly organized, actionable steps  \n  - Provides examples if present in the file  \n\nFor instance, if given “How to Build Actionable Prompts.pdf” and the goal “Extract time management strategies,” you should generate a prompt that guides the user step by step in extracting those strategies directly from the text.  \n\n─────────────────────────────  \nConclusion  \n─────────────────────────────  \nThis Super GPT prompt is built entirely on the context provided in the file “Turn Any Book into Actionable Prompts.” It ensures that all instructions and examples strictly adhere to the guidelines from the file and provide a structure that makes the task—the transformation of a book into actionable prompts—clear, logical, and fully actionable.\n\nThis completes the thought experiment on constructing a Super GPT prompt based solely on the file’s context and requirements.",

Your responsibility is to generate a refined prompt based entirely on the provided file’s content and aligned with the goal given by the user.\n\n─────────────────────────────  \nTask/Goal:  \nTransform any provided book (in PDF format) into an actionable and comprehensible prompt that meets the user’s specified goal(s).\n\n─────────────────────────────  \n1. Clearly Defined Input:  \n• The PDF file of a book (uploaded by the user)  \n• A concise description of the desired goal or task that the prompt should accomplish (provided by the user)\n\n─────────────────────────────  \n2. Descriptive Context:  \nThe prompt creation process hinges on understanding the book’s central themes, concepts, and actionable insights.  \n• The goal is derived from the book’s context, ensuring that the created prompt remains highly relevant to the material in the PDF file.  \n• This includes pinpointing crucial topics—such as narrative strategies, methodologies, or any frameworks presented in the text—that are essential to understanding the material and aligning them with the intended outcome.  \n• It ensures that the prompt is not generic but tailored to harness the book’s educational and conceptual value.\n\n─────────────────────────────  \n3. Rules to Accomplish the Task:  \n• The analysis and generated prompt must strictly adhere to the information within the uploaded PDF file.  \n• Ensure that only the core and unique aspects of the book’s content get highlighted—avoid incorporating extraneous or external ideas.  \n• All instructions and steps should specifically reference details and exemplary material found within the file.  \n• Maintain clarity and precision, making sure that each guideline directly supports the task’s objective.\n\n─────────────────────────────  \n4. Step-by-Step Procedure to Accomplish the Task:  \nStep 1: Receive and inspect the PDF file to understand its detailed content and central themes.  \nStep 2: Listen carefully to the user’s specified goal or task that needs to be transformed into a prompt.  \nStep 3: Identify and highlight crucial concepts, examples, and methodological insights embedded in the book.  \nStep 4: Clearly define the type of input (the PDF upload and goal description) needed to generate the actionable prompt.  \nStep 5: Compose a full prompt that includes the following sections:  \n  a. A clearly defined input section  \n  b. A descriptive context that integrates key themes and concepts from the book  \n  c. A set of rules guiding the task, aligned solely with the file’s content  \n  d. An ordered, step-by-step procedure for executing the task  \n  e. Any examples provided in the file, if available, to further illustrate the process  \nStep 6: Review the composed prompt to ensure it remains tightly connected to the book and the user’s goals.\n\n─────────────────────────────  \n5. Examples (if available in the file):  \n• For instance, if the uploaded paper/book offers a case study or a specific scenario, extract that context and include it as an example to illustrate how the final prompt should be executed.  \n• If the file demonstrates a particular process or methodology (e.g., a step-by-step guide to analyzing themes), then include that as part of the prompt’s example to provide clarity.\n\n─────────────────────────────  \nImportant Concepts Highlighted:  \n• Input Definition: Emphasizing what is needed—both the PDF and a clear task description  \n• Contextual Relevance: Ensuring that every part of the prompt correlates directly to the content and themes of the book  \n• Procedural Clarity: Offering a logical and concise plan that guides the prompt generation process  \n• Focus on File-Specific Content: Keeping the generation process anchored strictly to the particulars of the provided material  \n• Example Incorporation: Utilizing any exemplary material from the book to illustrate and validate the steps or task at hand\n\n─────────────────────────────  \nFinal Super GPT Prompt Output Example:  \n\n“You are SuperPrompter GPT. Your task is to analyze this PDF file of a book and convert its core insights into an actionable prompt. First, extract the central themes and relevant methodologies presented in the book. The input includes the PDF file and a clear description of the task/goal provided by the user.  \n  • Input: The uploaded PDF file and a text description of the desired goal.  \n  • Context: Based solely on the book’s narrative and analytical elements, identify and elaborate on concepts directly relevant to achieving the goal.  \n  • Rules: Only use information found within the provided PDF file; do not introduce external concepts. Follow these steps:  \n    (1) Analyze the book for key insights and methods  \n    (2) Outline the prompt structure (input specs, contextual description, rules, steps, examples)  \n    (3) Generate a comprehensive prompt that aligns with the task/goal  \n  • Example: If the book includes a chapter on strategic planning, clearly illustrate how that method can form part of structuring the prompt.”  \n\nThis prompt ensures that the task adheres strictly to the contents of the file and is specifically tailored to turn book material into actionable prompts, exactly as defined by the user’s goal.  \n\n─────────────────────────────  \n\nYou may now proceed by providing the specific PDF file and describing the goal/task to generate your personalized Super GPT prompt.",

          "response": "Below is an example of how to create a Super GPT prompt by “turning” a book (its PDF contents) and your specified goal into an actionable prompt. This example carefully follows the structure outlined in your file, including defining the input, context, crucial concepts, rules, a step-by-step procedure, and examples.\n\n──────────────────────────────\nSuper GPT Prompt Example\n\nRole:\n You are SuperPrompter GPT. Your primary objective is to create detailed, actionable prompts based solely on the context provided by a book (in PDF format) along with a user-specified goal or task description.\n\nTask/Goal:\n Integrate the contents of the uploaded PDF book with the user’s stated objective to generate a clear and structured prompt that guides subsequent tasks.\n\n──────────────────────────────\nPrompt Appendage Instructions:\n\n1. Clearly Defined Input:\n • PDF File: The prompt should begin by specifying that the source material is a PDF file containing the book’s contents.\n • Goal/Task Description: Require the user to articulate the specific task or outcome they want to achieve using the book’s context.\n Example: “Please upload your book in PDF format and provide a clear statement of the goal you aim to accomplish.”\n\n2. Descriptive Context:\n • Explain that the PDF holds all necessary context related to the subject matter, methodology, or narrative ideas.\n • State that the role of this context is to inform the creation of a target prompt that leverages key ideas, insights, and methodologies found within the book.\n Example: “The book outlines techniques for transforming theoretical content into actionable steps, ensuring that our prompt is both context-aware and goal-directed.”\n\n3. Crucial Concepts:\n • PDF Upload: Emphasize that the initial step is the upload of a complete and legible PDF file of the book.\n • Goal Specification: Highlight the importance of providing a precise objective or task goal to focus the prompt accurately.\n • Actionable Prompt: Clarify that the result should be easily implementable, with clear steps derived from the book’s content.\n Explanation: “It is essential to understand that the quality of the actionable prompt depends on comprehending the uploaded material’s context and how it connects with your specified goal.”\n\n4. Rules to Accomplish the Task:\n • The prompt must use only information found in the book; no external content should be introduced.\n • Input constraints: The PDF must be uploaded in full and must not be an excerpt.\n • The user's goal description should be concise and specific to avoid ambiguity.\n • Any steps, procedures, or examples mentioned must directly relate to the content of the book.\n Example: “When creating the prompt, ensure that no additional data outside the PDF’s content is referenced.”\n\n5. Step-by-Step Procedure to Accomplish the Task:\n Step 1: Request the user to upload the complete PDF of the book.\n Step 2: Ask the user to provide a clear and concise description of their goal or task.\n Step 3: Scan or summarize the key elements provided in the PDF related to actionable steps or theoretical insights.\n Step 4: Identify and highlight crucial concepts within the PDF that directly inform the task.\n Step 5: Structure the prompt by integrating the input, context, crucial concepts, and task rules.\n Step 6: Offer examples (if available) from the book as practical illustrations of how to apply the steps.\n Step 7: Finalize the prompt and verify that all elements (input, context, concepts, rules, procedure, and examples) have been incorporated.\n\n6. Examples:\n • If the book includes a chapter on “Methodologies for Effective Prompts,” extract a brief excerpt explaining a method.\n • For instance, if the book details a three-phase process (Ideation → Elaboration → Execution), include an example like:\n  - Input: “Upload PDF and describe goal.”\n  - Context: “The book outlines a clear process to ideate, elaborate, and execute actionable steps.”\n  - Actionable Instruction: “Using the three-phase process mentioned, create a detailed plan that maps each phase to your goal.”\n\n──────────────────────────────\nSummary\n\nUsing the structure above, the final Super GPT prompt will instruct the assistant to:\n • Request the necessary inputs (PDF and goal).\n • Analyze and extract relevant context and crucial concepts from the uploaded PDF.\n • Enforce strict guidelines and constraints based solely on the book.\n • Provide a clear, step-by-step process for turning the provided book content into an actionable prompt.\n • Include examples directly sourced from the book (if available) to illustrate the process.\n\nThis comprehensive approach ensures that the generated Super GPT prompt is not only actionable but also deeply rooted in the context provided by the book's content.\n\n──────────────────────────────\nThis is the complete example prompt structure that you can use or adjust based on your specific document and objective.",

This involves extracting key information, concepts, and tasks from the book and translating them into clear, step-by-step prompts that can be used to generate relevant and useful output.\n\nCrucial Concepts:\n1. Book-to-Prompt Conversion: The process of analyzing a book's content and transforming it into a series of actionable prompts that can be used to generate specific outputs or complete tasks.\n2. Prompt Engineering: The art of crafting prompts that effectively communicate the desired task, provide the necessary context, and elicit the intended response from a language model.\n3. Relevance and Usefulness: The prompts should be designed to extract the most relevant and useful information from the book, ensuring that the generated output is meaningful and actionable.\n\nRules:\n1. The prompts should be based solely on the content and context provided in the book.\n2. The prompts should be clear, concise, and easy to understand, with a well-defined input, context, and step-by-step procedure.\n3. The prompts should be designed to generate outputs that are relevant and useful to the user's goals.\n\nStep-by-Step Procedure:\n1. Upload the PDF file containing the book.\n2. Analyze the book's content, identifying key concepts, tasks, and information that can be turned into actionable prompts.\n3. For each prompt, define the following:\n   a. Clearly Defined Input: Specify the exact type of input needed to generate the desired output.\n   b. Descriptive Context: Provide a relevant description of the goal or task derived from the book's content.\n   c. Rules to Accomplish the Task: Enumerate any specific rules or constraints that govern the task.\n   d. Step-by-Step Procedure: Lay out a clear, ordered procedure for accomplishing the task, with each step logically following from the previous one.\n   e. Examples: If the book provides relevant examples, include them to further illustrate the prompt.\n4. Compile the prompts into a cohesive and organized structure, ensuring that they are easy to understand and implement.\n\nExamples: Unfortunately, there are no examples provided in the file. However, the book-to-prompt conversion process can be illustrated with the following example:\n\nBook Content: The book discusses the importance of effective communication in the workplace. One key task it covers is how to give constructive feedback to employees.\n\nPrompt:\nInput: Describe a recent workplace interaction where you provided feedback to an employee.\nDescriptive Context: Provide a step-by-step guide for giving constructive feedback to an employee in the workplace, based on the principles outlined in the book.\nRules:\n1. The feedback should be specific, actionable, and focused on the employee's behavior or performance, not their personality.\n2. The feedback should include both positive and constructive elements.\n3. The feedback should be delivered in a respectful and empathetic manner.\nStep-by-Step Procedure:\n1. Start the conversation by acknowledging the employee's strengths and positive contributions.\n2. Describe the specific behavior or performance issue you want to address, using clear and objective language.\n3. Explain the impact of the behavior on the team, project, or organization.\n4. Offer suggestions for improvement, framing them as opportunities for growth and development.\n5. Encourage the employee to provide their perspective and engage in a collaborative discussion.\n6. Agree on a plan for improvement, including any necessary support or resources.\n7. Follow up regularly to monitor progress and provide additional feedback as needed.\nExamples:\n\"During our team meeting last week, I noticed that you interrupted your colleague several times while they were presenting their project update. This made it difficult for the rest of the team to follow the discussion, and it may have come across as disrespectful. In the future, I would appreciate it if you could wait for your turn to speak and allow others to share their updates without interruption. This will help ensure that our meetings are productive and that everyone feels heard.\"",

This prompt is created following the structure provided in “Book to Prompt: Turn Any Book into Actionable Prompts” by Lucas C Pimentel. It ensures that the input, context, rules, procedure, and examples are presented clearly and strictly based on the content of the file.\n\n──────────────────────────────\nROLE: SECURITY CONSULTANT  \nTASK: CONDUCT A SECURITY ASSESSMENT\n\n──────────────────────────────\nSuper GPT Prompt:\n\n1. Clearly Defined Input:\n   • Provide detailed documentation of the system to be assessed. This includes network diagrams, system architecture overviews, lists of security controls currently in place, and any recent security audit reports or penetration test records.\n   • Specify the environment (e.g., production, development) and any particular areas of concern or focus (e.g., authentication mechanisms, data storage, communication channels).\n\n2. Descriptive Context:\n   • The goal is to thoroughly evaluate the current security posture of a given system and identify vulnerabilities and risks. This security assessment should result in actionable recommendations and remediation strategies.\n   • The assessment is expected to consider relevant security concepts such as threat modeling, risk analysis, vulnerability management, access control, incident response, and compliance requirements.\n   • The prompt should emphasize that the evaluation is based solely on provided documentation and that critical security assessment concepts should be extracted and elaborated upon to generate clear next steps.\n\n3. Rules to Accomplish the Task:\n   • Only use the provided documentation as the basis for the analysis—do not assume any external context.\n   • Focus on actionable recommendations that can be directly applied by system administrators or security teams.\n   • Maintain an objective perspective by listing risks, vulnerabilities, and corresponding countermeasures without overstepping into unvalidated assumptions.\n   • Ensure that the analysis follows industry best practices, standards (such as ISO 27001, NIST, or CIS Controls), and adheres to any organizational policies mentioned in the documentation.\n\n4. Step-by-Step Procedure to Accomplish the Task:\n   Step 1. Collection & Preparation:\n         - Gather and review the input documents, system architecture diagrams, and current security controls.\n         - List down all key components such as servers, databases, network boundaries, and user authentication systems.\n   Step 2. Threat Modeling & Vulnerability Identification:\n         - Identify potential attack vectors and map possible threats to each system component.\n         - Use techniques like STRIDE or DREAD to prioritize threat severity.\n   Step 3. Risk Analysis:\n         - Analyze the likelihood and impact of each identified threat.\n         - Categorize risks into high, medium, and low based on the available documentation.\n   Step 4. Recommendations & Actionable Steps:\n         - For each identified risk or vulnerability, propose specific security controls or procedural adjustments.\n         - Provide detailed remediation steps, including timelines, responsible roles, and references to security frameworks.\n   Step 5. Reporting & Follow-Up:\n         - Summarize findings in a comprehensive report with an executive summary, detailed technical findings, and actionable recommendations.\n         - Propose a timeline for re-assessment or mitigation action confirmation.\n\n5. Examples (Based on Provided Context):\n   • Example Input: \"The system architecture document reveals that the user authentication is handled solely by a custom-built mechanism without multifactor authentication. Additionally, the database is hosted on a legacy server with known vulnerabilities.\"\n   • Example Analysis: \"The lack of multifactor authentication increases the risk of unauthorized access, particularly if user credentials are compromised. A mitigation strategy is to integrate an MFA solution and update the user session management process.\"\n   • Example Recommendation: \"Implement MFA and verify session timeouts. Document the integration process and conduct a follow-up audit after 30 days to assess improvement.\"\n\n──────────────────────────────\nSummary:\nThis Super GPT prompt is designed for a security assessment by a security consultant, focusing on gathering detailed system documentation, conducting a thorough risk analysis, and providing clear, actionable recommendations while strictly adhering to the guidelines and context derived from the book.",

          "response": "Below is an example of a Super GPT prompt built directly from the instructions in the file. This prompt is designed to turn any book (PDF) into a set of actionable prompts, with every detail clearly specified to guide the process. Note that all parts below are directly derived from the content provided in the file, ensuring that we only discuss what is mentioned there.\n\n──────────────────────────── Start of Super GPT Prompt ────────────────────────────\n\nYou are SuperPrompter GPT.\n\nYour role is to help create a tailored, actionable prompt based on the context from the provided file. The user will provide a PDF file (a book) and specify their desired goal, and you will construct a prompt that incorporates the following components:\n\n1. Clearly Defined Input:\n   • Specify exactly what input is expected:\n     – A PDF file containing the book.\n     – A single, concise goal statement defining what the user wants to achieve (e.g., turn the content of the book into actionable steps or prompts).\n\n2. Descriptive Context:\n   • Provide a rich description of the user's goal/task derived from the file. For instance:\n     – Indicate that the task involves dynamically converting book content into a series of practical and executable prompts.\n     – Elaborate on why the PDF is important: the book’s ideas, structure, and examples must inform the resultant prompts.\n   • Highlight crucial concepts from the file:\n     – Actionable Prompts: Steps or instructions derived directly from the content of the book that can be executed sequentially.\n     – Contextual Relevance: Ensuring that each prompt remains faithful to the underlying ideas or instructional content of the book.\n     – Input Specification and Output Requirement: Being specific about both the source (the book) and the result (the actionable prompts).\n\n3. Rules to Accomplish the Task:\n   • Follow any explicit procedural guidelines included in the file:\n     – Do not invent concepts beyond what is provided in the file—only use the context and examples within.\n     – Ensure all details in the prompt remain directly tied to the content of the book and its transformation to actionable steps.\n     – Any constraints on the input (e.g., only a PDF file is acceptable) must be clearly stated.\n\n4. Step-by-Step Procedure to Accomplish the Task:\n   • Step 1: Receive and verify the input – a PDF of a book and a clear goal statement.\n   • Step 2: Analyze the content of the PDF, identifying structural components, themes, and any embedded examples.\n   • Step 3: Based on the goal provided by the user, extract actionable principles or steps from the PDF.\n   • Step 4: Organize these extracted principles into a clear, ordered list of prompts.\n   • Step 5: Ensure that every prompt includes its specific context, explicit instructions, and references to the relevant parts of the book.\n   • Step 6: Present the final set of actionable prompts to the User for review.\n\n5. Examples:\n   • If the book contains a chapter on “Time Management Techniques,” the resulting prompt might be:\n     – Input: “Time Management Chapter from [Book Title]”\n     – Context: “Extract actionable techniques focused on scheduling, prioritization, and task management as outlined in the chapter.”\n     – Step-by-Step: “Identify key techniques, list them sequentially, and provide a brief explanation for each as found in the text.”\n   • These examples serve as direct illustrations derived from the file.\n\n──────────────────────────── End of Super GPT Prompt ─────────────────────────────\n\nThis prompt includes:\n– Defined inputs that the user must provide.\n– Rich descriptive context ensuring relevance and understanding.\n– Explicit rules to ensure the task is completed exactly per the file’s instructions.\n– A detailed, step-by-step process.\n– Conceptual examples drawn directly from the file, ensuring the explanation is connected to the source material.\n\nBy following this structure, the Super GPT prompt ensures that any book converted into actionable prompts remains consistent, context-aware, and directly tied to the content and methodology provided in the file.",

To create a “super GPT prompt” that accurately reflects the content of your book or document, it’s crucial to have those specific details. Below is a general template you can use once you’re ready to incorporate the file’s content. Simply replace the placeholders (e.g., [FILE CONTENT], [IMPORTANT CONCEPT], etc.) with the relevant information from your uploaded document.\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n\nPROMPT TEMPLATE\n\nROLE AND TASK/GOAL:\n• [Clearly state the role of the AI or the system you are prompting (e.g., “You are an expert business strategist...”)]\n• [Describe the primary goal or outcome you want (e.g., “...your task is to analyze the marketing case studies in the file.”)]\n\n1. INPUT (Clearly Defined Input)\n   • Provide a detailed description of the type of input required from the user or from the file for this prompt.  \n     Example: “The input will be the PDF text or specific sections from [FILE CONTENT] discussing [TOPIC].”\n\n2. DESCRIPTIVE CONTEXT\n   • Offer background information from the file that helps the AI (or user) understand the purpose, scope, and nature of the task.  \n     Example Context Points from your file might include:  \n       – [IMPORTANT CONCEPT 1]: [Explanation derived from the file]  \n       – [IMPORTANT CONCEPT 2]: [Explanation derived from the file]  \n   • Highlight any key terms or sections particularly relevant to the task.  \n     Example: “The file focuses on sustainable marketing strategies, emphasizing consumer engagement and product positioning.”\n\n3. RULES TO ACCOMPLISH THE TASK\n   • List constraints or guidelines mentioned in the file that shape how the goal must be achieved.  \n     – [RULE 1]: Describe it in detail.  \n     – [RULE 2]: Describe it in detail.  \n   • Note any specific do’s and don’ts explicitly stated in the file.\n\n4. STEP-BY-STEP PROCEDURE\n   • Outline a methodical sequence the AI should follow when generating a response or actionable insights.  \n     Example:  \n       Step 1: Summarize the specific chapter(s) or section(s) relevant to [GOAL].  \n       Step 2: Identify the main arguments or data supporting each concept.  \n       Step 3: Compare or contrast the findings with real-world examples (if the file supports it).  \n       Step 4: Suggest actionable strategies or recommendations based on the context.  \n       Step 5: Format the final output in bullet points or paragraphs, as needed.\n\n5. EXAMPLES (Based on the File)\n   • Provide any examples included in the file that show how the concepts or instructions are used in practice.  \n   • If the file has sample dialogues, case studies, or templates, include concise references or quotes here.\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n\nADVANCED NOTES:\n• Whenever possible, use direct quotes or paraphrases from the file to ground your instructions in concrete details.  \n• Focus specifically on the information that the file provides; avoid adding external assumptions not supported by the text.  \n• If you wish to emphasize particular themes (for instance, leadership, strategy, design), reference the parts of the file that discuss them and clarify why they’re important.\n\nHOW TO USE THIS TEMPLATE:\n1. Once you upload your PDF/book content, fill in the placeholders (e.g., “File details,” “Important concepts,” “Rules from the file,” etc.).  \n2. Replace the generic examples with real excerpts and context from your specific document.  \n3. Present the final prompt to GPT (or any LLM) to ensure that the system understands all the essential requirements, context, and steps aligned with your goal.\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n\nFeel free to share the actual content of your file or relevant sections when you’re ready. That will allow me (or any AI tool) to craft a more precise “super GPT prompt” tailored to your specific text.",

          "response": "Below is an example framework – a template – that you (as SuperPrompter GPT) can follow to transform any book (provided as a PDF file) into a set of actionable prompts. This framework breaks the process into clear sections, ensuring that every detail from the file is considered and that the outcome is both precise and context-rich.\n\n──────────────────────────────\n□ 1. Role Assignment and Task Purpose\n\n• Role: You are “SuperPrompter GPT.”\n• Task: Your goal is to create a Super Prompt based on the content of the provided file (the book’s PDF). The final prompt will help users quickly derive actionable tasks, insights, and steps directly inspired by the book.\n\n──────────────────────────────\n□ 2. Clearly Defined Input\n\nDefine exactly what type of information you expect:\n• File Input: The PDF file (or its textual content) of the book.\n• Input Data Types: Textual content, contextual summaries, chapter headings, key concepts, and any examples the book offers.\n• Example Prompt: “Please provide the text or summaries from the book that focus on [topic].”\n\n──────────────────────────────\n□ 3. Descriptive Context Based on the File\n\nSummarize the key aspects of the book that are relevant to the task:\n• Describe the overarching goal or message of the book.\n• Identify crucial themes, methodologies, or frameworks introduced in the text.\n• Elaborate on any strategies or actionable advice that the book communicates.\n• Example: “This book outlines step-by-step methods for improving productivity. Key strategies include time-blocking, priority setting, and structured goal evaluation.”\n\n──────────────────────────────\n□ 4. Rules to Accomplish the Task\n\nList explicit guidelines and constraints:\n• Only use information provided by the file.\n• Ensure that every actionable prompt directly relates to points or examples mentioned in the book.\n• Maintain accuracy by cross-referencing the file’s context.\n• Example Rule: “Do not introduce any concepts, methods, or examples that are not mentioned in the book.”\n\n──────────────────────────────\n□ 5. Step-by-Step Procedure to Create the Prompt\n\nLay out a logical, ordered process:\nStep 1. Read and extract key elements of the book’s content (chapters, concepts, advice, examples).\nStep 2. Identify actionable points directly mentioned or implied in the text.\nStep 3. Categorize the text into segments: input type needed, context summary, rules/constraints, step-by-step instructions, and examples.\nStep 4. Formulate an overarching prompt that clearly describes the task in each segment.\nStep 5. Review the draft prompt to ensure that every detail originates only from the file and that important concepts are clearly highlighted.\n\n──────────────────────────────\n□ 6. Providing Examples\n\nInclude any examples available in the file:\n• If the file contains examples (e.g., case studies or sample exercises), mirror their structure in your prompt.\n• Example: “Based on the book’s case study about time management, create a prompt that asks: ‘List three ways to implement time-blocking as described in the case study.’”\n\n──────────────────────────────\n□ 7. Key Explanations for Better Context\n\nEmphasize and explain crucial concepts so that users understand the “why” behind each instruction:\n• Explain why the input type is needed (to guarantee clarity and appropriate context).\n• Clarify how each set of rules ensures that the actionable prompts remain true to the book’s information.\n• Highlight that the step-by-step structure helps in organizing thoughts and aligning them with the book's progression.\n\n──────────────────────────────\nFinal SuperPrompt Template (Example Completion)\n\n“You are SuperPrompter GPT. You have been provided with a PDF file containing a book that covers strategies for [main topic]. Your task is to create a highly actionable prompt based exclusively on the content of this file. \n\n1. Input: The file includes textual explanations, chapter summaries, key strategies, and examples. The input should cover all these components.\n2. Context: The book centers on practical techniques for [goal/task]. Important themes such as [theme 1], [theme 2], and [theme 3] are discussed in detail.\n3. Rules: \n   – Only use details provided in the file.\n   – Maintain the original context and phrasing as much as possible.\n   – Do not introduce external ideas.\n4. Procedure:\n   – Extract major themes and actionable points from the text.\n   – Organize the content into input, context description, rules, detailed procedure, and examples.\n   – Construct the final prompt based solely on this extracted information.\n5. Example: If the book includes a chapter on “Time Management,” then one prompt could be: ‘Describe three actionable strategies for effective time management as outlined in the file.’ \n\nFollow these instructions carefully to ensure the final prompt is accurately derived from the provided PDF content.”\n\n──────────────────────────────\n\nThis complete framework respects your request:\n• It integrates clearly defined input expectations.\n• Offers descriptive context extracted from the file.\n• Lists a set of precise rules for fidelity.\n• Provides a step-by-step procedure.\n• And where available, it incorporates examples from the file.\n\nBy adhering to this structure, you will create a Super Prompt that captures the essence of the book while guiding users to actionable insights.",

This guide will help you turn any book (PDF) into actionable prompts using the outlined SuperPrompter GPT method.\n\n---\n\n# Step-by-Step Breakdown: Book to Prompt\n\n### 1. Upload the PDF of a Book\n- Start by selecting the PDF file of the book you want to work with.\n- Upload the PDF to the Book to Prompt tool or chatbot.\n\n---\n\n### 2. State Your Goal or Task\n- Clearly articulate the objective you want to turn into a prompt.\n- Example: “Summarize each chapter for study notes,” or “Generate discussion questions for a book club.”\n\n---\n\n### 3. SuperPrompter GPT Will Guide You to Build a Super Prompt\n\n#### a) Define the Role and Task/Goal\n- Specify the “role” (e.g., expert summarizer, creative writing coach, quiz master) for the GPT.\n- State the task or goal you want to achieve (as mentioned in step 2).\n\n#### b) Append the Prompt with the Following Elements:\n\n**1. Clearly Defined Input**\n   - Specify exactly what input the prompt expects (e.g., chapter text, section title, or a summary request).\n\n**2. Descriptive Context**\n   - Use relevant information from the book to frame the goal/task.\n   - Highlight and elaborate on crucial concepts or themes from the book that relate to your task.\n   - Ensure the context is strictly drawn from the book content.\n\n**3. Rules to Accomplish the Task**\n   - Enumerate specific rules or constraints (e.g., “Do not exceed 3 sentences per answer,” “Reference only content from the chapter,” “Use simple language suitable for high school students”).\n\n**4. Step-by-Step Procedure**\n   - Lay out a clear, ordered method for completing the task.\n   - Each step should logically follow the previous one and relate directly to the book’s content.\n\n**5. Examples (If Available)**\n   - If the book contains examples, extract and include them to clarify the prompt’s requirements.\n   - Use only examples provided in the book.\n\n---\n\n### 4. Abide by These Rules\n\n- Only refer to and use information present in the uploaded PDF.\n- Focus on important concepts that directly support your goal.\n- Be precise and descriptive, avoiding unnecessary or external information.\n- Enhance the prompt’s quality by giving detailed, relevant context derived from the book.\n\n---\n\n## Example Workflow\n\nLet’s say you uploaded a PDF of “To Kill a Mockingbird” and want to create prompts for chapter summaries:\n\n1. Upload the PDF.\n2. State your goal: “Create a prompt to generate concise chapter summaries.”\n3. SuperPrompter GPT will help you build a prompt with:\n   - **Input:** Chapter text.\n   - **Context:** Major themes (justice, childhood, social inequality) from the chapter.\n   - **Rules:** Summary must be 3 sentences, use only chapter content, mention key events and characters.\n   - **Procedure:** Read chapter → Identify main events → Highlight key characters → Write 3-sentence summary.\n   - **Examples:** If the book includes chapter abstracts, use those as examples.\n\n---\n\n## Summary Table\n\n| Step | Action |\n|------|--------|\n| 1    | Upload PDF of the book |\n| 2    | State your goal for the prompt |\n| 3    | SuperPrompter GPT structures the prompt with input, context, rules, procedure, and examples |\n| 4    | Follow the rules: use only the file, highlight key concepts, be precise |\n\n---\n\n**In summary:**  \nThe Book to Prompt method lets you turn any book into actionable prompts by uploading the PDF, stating your goal, and systematically building a super prompt with strictly book-derived context, clear rules, and step-by-step guidance—all while focusing on the most relevant concepts from the book.\n\nIf you have a specific book and goal in mind, I can help you walk through these steps interactively!",

          "response": "Below is a concise, high-level walkthrough of the “Book to Prompt” method as described by Lucas C. Pimentel, based on the instructions you provided. Since the core idea is to transform a PDF (the “book”) into an actionable prompt, the outline focuses on the two main actions: uploading a PDF and defining a goal, then structuring a Super GPT prompt accordingly.\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n1) Set the Role and Goal\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n• Provide the system (or “SuperPrompter GPT”) with its specific role: it will transform the content of the book into a prompt tailored to your needs.  \n• Clearly state your end goal—for example, whether you want to create lesson plans, develop summaries, brainstorm new ideas, or any other objective derived from the PDF.\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n2) Identify the Input\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n• Define the exact type of input that the prompt will handle (in this case, the PDF of the book).  \n• Specify what format the text is in (e.g., PDF, plain text) and how the system should read or interpret it.  \n• Make sure to note any relevant sections or chapters if you only need to focus on certain parts of the book.\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n3) Provide Descriptive Context\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n• Summarize or highlight the main ideas from the PDF that relate directly to your goal.  \n• Call out any key topics, insights, or notable quotes that will inform the prompt creation process.  \n• Clarify why these ideas are important for achieving the stated goal.  \n• This context helps the Super GPT (or any language model) better understand the essence of the material and deliver more accurate or creative responses.\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n4) Lay Out the Rules\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n• Include constraints or guidelines that the final prompt must follow—e.g., minimal jargon, specific style or tone, or length limitations.  \n• Note any “dos and don’ts” for interpretation: certain chapters to ignore, certain frameworks to emphasize, etc.  \n• These rules ensure focused, high-quality responses aligned with your purpose.\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n5) Craft the Step-by-Step Procedure\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nOutline how to go from raw PDF text to a well-structured prompt:\n  a) Read/parse the full PDF or the designated sections.  \n  b) Extract key points, quotes, or data relevant to the goal.  \n  c) Organize those points into categories or bullet lists if needed.  \n  d) Combine the extracted points and your goal into a coherent prompt structure (following your chosen format: input, context, rules, steps, examples).  \n  e) Review and refine to ensure clarity and completeness.\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n6) Provide Examples (If Available)\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n• If the PDF offers sample use cases or case studies, include them.  \n• Demonstrate how these examples map to the newly created prompt.  \n• If relevant, show variations of prompts for different audiences or objectives.\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n7) Final Assembly: The “Super” Prompt\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n• After steps 1–6, merge everything into a single prompt that a language model can readily understand:  \n   – Start with your role and goal (“You are SuperPrompter GPT...”).  \n   – Insert an organized summary of the relevant book content (key concepts, crucial chapters, or quotes).  \n   – List the core rules that must be followed.  \n   – Provide a clear, numbered procedure for solving the task.  \n   – Include examples illustrating how the output should look.\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nWhy It Works\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n• By giving the system a well-defined role and goal, you directly shape the type of response you receive.  \n• Supplying clear input (the PDF) and relevant context ensures that the language model focuses on the most important concepts.  \n• Stating rules and procedures prevents the output from becoming too broad or unfocused.  \n• Concrete examples demonstrate the exact format and style you expect.  \n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nConclusion\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nThis process—uploading a book in PDF form and specifying your goal—drives the creation of a highly targeted “Super GPT Prompt” by combining well-defined inputs, relevant context, explicit rules, clear procedures, and actionable examples. The final result is a prompt that accurately harnesses the content of the book to meet your specific objectives.",

Upload the Book File  \n • Step: Begin by uploading the PDF file that contains the book.  \n • Purpose: The file provides all the context and content from which to derive actionable prompts.\n\n2. Define Your Goal/Task  \n • Step: Clearly state the specific role and task or goal you want to transform into a prompt.  \n • Purpose: This helps focus the prompt’s output by telling the system exactly what your expected outcome is.\n\n3. Assume the SuperPrompter GPT Role  \n • Instruction: The system (or assistant) takes on the persona “SuperPrompter GPT”.  \n • Purpose: This role is charged with reading the provided file (i.e., the book) and assembling a tailored prompt based on your provided goal.\n\n4. Append Key Prompt Components  \n After receiving the role and task, the SuperPrompter GPT is instructed to enrich the prompt by adding these elements:\n  a. Clearly Defined Input  \n   – Detail the exact nature or format of input needed for the prompt.\n  b. Descriptive Context  \n   – Provide a relevant description derived from the file’s content.  \n   – Explain the goal or task using insights and key concepts present in the text.\n  c. Rules to Accomplish the Task  \n   – List any constraints, guidelines, or procedural rules that should be followed.\n  d. Step-by-Step Procedure  \n   – Lay out an ordered set of steps the user should follow, ensuring that each step logically builds on the previous one.\n  e. Examples (if available)  \n   – Include clear examples from the file to illustrate the concepts and guide the user.\n\n5. Follow the Specific Guidelines  \n • Rule: Highlight and explain important concepts that are directly mentioned in the file.  \n • Rule: Be precisely descriptive, limiting the discussion only to the content available in the file.  \n • Purpose: This ensures that only relevant and accurate information from the book is used to construct the actionable prompt.\n\n6. Finalize and Output the Super GPT Prompt  \n • Step: Combine all the appended elements (input type, descriptive context, rules, procedure, and examples) along with your original task statement.  \n • Purpose: This creates a comprehensive, actionable Super GPT prompt that leverages both the context from the book and your specific goal.\n\nBy following these steps, the \"Book to Prompt\" process effectively transforms a PDF book into a structured prompt ready for further use or interaction, ensuring that the prompt is both contextual and actionable while adhering to the guidelines found in the file.\n\nThis breakdown directly reflects the instructions provided by Lucas C Pimentel in the linked guide and the markdown excerpt.",

          "response": "Below is a detailed step-by-step breakdown and explanation of the process described in Lucas C Pimentel's \"Book to Prompt\" approach. This breakdown clearly details how you can take nearly any book (uploaded as a PDF) and systematically turn it into actionable, effective GPT prompts.\n\n## Step-by-Step Breakdown of the \"Book to Prompt\" Process:\n\n---\n\n## 1. Prepare Your Material:\n\n### Step 1: Upload a PDF  \n- Choose the PDF of a book that you want to transform into actionable GPT prompts.  \n- This PDF typically contains important ideas, concepts, guidelines, or examples relevant to your desired goal or task.\n\n### Step 2: State Your Goal Clearly  \n- Clearly articulate the specific goal or task you want to turn into a GPT-generated prompt.  \n- **Example goal:** \"Create a GPT prompt that helps me summarize key insights from the book,\" or \"Create a prompt that lets me apply key principles from the book to my daily tasks.\"\n\n---\n\n## 2. Define the Components of a \"Super GPT Prompt\":\n\nAccording to Pimentel’s method, each GPT prompt must consist of the following clearly defined components:\n\n### Component 1: Clearly Defined Input\nPrecisely define what kind of input you will provide to your GPT prompt.  \n**Example:**  \n- **If summarizing key ideas:** The input might be a chapter title, a section of text, or specific concepts extracted from the book.  \n- **If applying principles:** The input could be a scenario, a specific problem, or a practical issue you are facing.\n\n### Component 2: Descriptive Context (Crucial)\nProvide background information derived directly from the uploaded book to guide the prompt creation process. Clearly summarize and highlight the key ideas, concepts, or lessons from the book that directly relate to your stated goal.\n\n**Important points:**  \n- Clearly identify key concepts and explain why they're relevant.  \n- Highlight the key themes, frameworks, methodologies, or theories from the book that directly inform your task.\n\n### Component 3: Rules to Accomplish the Task\nList any specific constraints, guidelines, or conditions explicitly mentioned in the book that should be followed to properly achieve your stated goal.\n\n**Examples of rules might include:**  \n- Constraints on length or format (e.g., a short paragraph summary, bullet points, structured response).  \n- Guidelines on applying principles (e.g., steps to follow, conditions that must be met).\n\n### Component 4: Step-by-Step Procedure to Accomplish the Task\nClearly lay out a structured approach derived from the book for performing the goal/task. This must be logical and easy to follow.\n\n**Example:** (If your task is summarization, a procedure might be:)  \n- Step 1: Clearly identify main arguments or points.  \n- Step 2: Organize ideas logically according to the author's structure.  \n- Step 3: Condense the content into concise and coherent points.  \n- Step 4: Clearly summarize the author's intention or final takeaway.\n\n### Component 5: Examples (if available)\nIf the book provides illustrative examples, include these explicitly to guide GPT’s response. Examples help the GPT model clearly understand style, tone, and the desired output.\n\n**Examples might include:**  \n- Excerpts demonstrating concepts.  \n- Practical scenarios described by the author.  \n- Author-provided summaries or applications of certain concepts.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Important Guidelines to Successfully Create the Prompt:\n\n- **Highlight Crucial Concepts Clearly:**  \n  Identify and clarify key points, theories, methods, or principles from the book that are crucial for achieving your stated goal. Explain them clearly and succinctly.\n\n- **Stick Closely to the Book’s Content:**  \n  Only describe concepts or guidelines explicitly found in the original document. Avoid adding unrelated or external ideas.\n\n- **Precision and Clarity:**  \n  Clearly define exactly what input is required and exactly what the output should look like.\n\n---\n\n## 4. Example of a Final Structured Prompt Template (Illustrative):\n\nHere is a generalized example of how the final structured prompt might look (based on the components above):\n\n```markdown\nYou are SuperPrompter GPT.\n\nYour task is to help me summarize key ideas from the uploaded PDF.\n\nClearly Defined Input:\n- Input: A single chapter from the uploaded PDF file.\n\nDescriptive Context:\n- The PDF discusses practical methods for increasing productivity. It emphasizes two major concepts: Deep Work and Attention Residue. Deep Work is defined as distraction-free, concentrated work allowing maximum productivity, while Attention Residue refers to lingering distractions that harm productivity.\n\nRules to Accomplish the Task:\n- Summarize the chapter concisely in no more than 5 bullet points.\n- Clearly emphasize the relationship between Deep Work and Attention Residue.\n- Summarize only ideas explicitly mentioned in the chapter.\n\nStep-by-Step Procedure:\n- Step 1: Carefully read and identify main arguments in the chapter.\n- Step 2: Clearly note any definitions or explanations of crucial concepts.\n- Step 3: Highlight the connection the chapter draws between Deep Work and Attention Residue.\n- Step 4: Condense information into concise bullet points clearly reflecting the chapter’s intent.\n\nExamples:\n(Book excerpt example provided here, if available in the original PDF.)\n\n```\n\n---\n\n## Summary of the Workflow:\n\n1. **Upload PDF** → 2. **Clearly State Goal** → 3. **Define Input** → 4. **Extract Relevant Context/Concepts from Book** → 5. **Identify Rules & Constraints** → 6. **Step-by-step Procedure** → 7. **Examples (if available)** → **Final Prompt**\n\nBy systematically following this breakdown, you effectively transform any book into clear, actionable GPT prompts tailored precisely to your goals and grounded firmly in the source material provided.",

Le principe est d’analyser le PDF (ou l’ouvrage) et d’en extraire les éléments essentiels, puis de les formuler clairement sous forme d’instructions pour l’IA.\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nPROMPT A : STRUCTURE GLOBALE\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n\n1) RÔLE ET OBJECTIF DE L’IA\n   • Définissez clairement le rôle de l’IA et son objectif principal.\n     Ex. : « Vous êtes Superpropter GPT, un assistant qui va aider à [expliquer / résumer / analyser / etc.] le contenu d’un livre. »\n\n2) ENTRÉE CLAIREMENT DÉFINIE\n   • Indiquez clairement de quel type de contenu ou de données l’IA aura besoin.  \n   • Précisez le format, la forme ou la nature de l’entrée.  \n     - Exemple : « L’entrée sera le chapitre 3 au format texte. »  \n     - Ou : « L’entrée sera un résumé succinct du PDF. »\n\n3) CONTEXTE DESCRIPTIF\n   • Élaborez sur l’objectif ou la tâche, en vous appuyant sur les détails pertinents trouvés dans le livre ou le PDF.  \n   • Expliquez pourquoi cette tâche est importante et dans quelle mesure elle s’applique au contexte du livre.  \n   • Mettez en évidence les concepts clés mentionnés dans cet ouvrage.  \n     - Par exemple, s’il s’agit d’un livre de psychologie sur la motivation, mentionnez les concepts clés : comportements, auto-détermination, facteurs externes de motivation, etc.  \n     - Ne mentionnez que les éléments qui se trouvent réellement dans le texte.\n\n4) RÈGLES POUR ACCOMPLIR LA TÂCHE\n   • Listez précisément les directives à suivre, telles que :  \n     - Format de la sortie (par ex. : un paragraphe, une liste, un tableau).  \n     - Contraintes liées au ton ou au style : (soutenu, pédagogique, concis, etc.).  \n     - Mention des sources (n° de chapitres ou de pages, si nécessaire).  \n     - Le cadre à respecter (ne pas introduire d’éléments inventés, rester fidèle au texte, etc.).  \n\n5) PROCÉDURE ÉTAPE PAR ÉTAPE\n   • Organisez clairement les étapes pour réaliser la tâche, selon le contenu du livre ou du document.  \n   • Donnez à l’IA une séquence logique d’actions :  \n     1. Lire ou analyser la partie clé du texte.  \n     2. Identifier les concepts centrés sur [X ou Y] tels que décrits dans l’ouvrage.  \n     3. Comparer ou relier ces concepts si nécessaire.  \n     4. Résumer ou reformuler les points importants.  \n     5. Proposer des pistes d’analyse, d’application ou d’exemples en lien direct avec l’objectif.  \n\n6) EXEMPLES (SI DISPONIBLES)\n   • Incluez, si le livre en contient, des extraits ou des cas pratiques illustrant les concepts mentionnés.  \n   • Veillez à respecter les droits d’auteur en ne citant que de très courts extraits ou en paraphrasant.  \n   • Montrez comment ces exemples éclairent l’utilisation de votre prompt.  \n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nEXEMPLE DE « SUPER PROMPT » FINALISÉ\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n  \nVous êtes Superpropter GPT.  \nVotre objectif est de fournir un résumé analytique du chapitre 5 du livre intitulé « Les Fondamentaux de la Motivation ».  \n\n— Entrée clairement définie :  \nL’entrée sera le texte intégral du chapitre 5 (sous forme de texte brut) portant sur « Les théories cognitives de la motivation ».  \n\n— Contexte descriptif :  \nDans ce chapitre, l’auteur présente les théories cognitives comme le sentiment d’efficacité personnelle et le concept de locus de contrôle. L’objectif de la tâche est de comprendre comment ces théories s’appliquent en milieu scolaire. Il est crucial de mettre en évidence :  \n• Les principales définitions.  \n• Les implications pour l’élève et l’enseignant.  \n• Les limites possibles de chaque théorie.  \n\n— Règles pour accomplir la tâche :  \n1. Format de la sortie : fournir un résumé structuré en 3 paragraphes distincts (définitions, implications, limites).  \n2. Ton : adopter un style didactique et clair.  \n3. Ne pas inventer de terminologie absente du texte.  \n4. Ne pas dépasser 300 mots.  \n\n— Procédure étape par étape :  \n1. Analyser le texte brut du chapitre pour en extraire les définitions de l’efficacité personnelle et du locus de contrôle.  \n2. Noter les exemples précis donnés par l’auteur concernant les pratiques en classe.  \n3. Identifier les indices sur les limites et critiques de ces théories dans le cadre de l’enseignement.  \n4. Rassembler et organiser ces informations dans l’ordre demandé (définitions → implications → limites).  \n\n— Exemples :  \n• L’auteur décrit un élève qui doute de sa capacité à réussir un examen mais qui, après avoir reçu un feedback positif, renforce son sentiment d’efficacité personnelle.  \n• Il mentionne également un enseignant qui donne le contrôle à ses élèves sur le choix des activités, illustrant l’importance du locus de contrôle interne pour la motivation.  \n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nCOMMENT L’UTILISER\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n1) Adaptez cette structure pour n’importe quel livre ou document.  \n2) Remplacez le contexte descriptif, les règles, et la procédure par celles issues du texte cible.  \n3) Servez-vous d’exemples présents dans le livre pour illustrer de manière concrète.  \n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n\nEn suivant ce canevas, vous pouvez transformer le contenu de n’importe quel livre en une invite structurée et efficace, qui servira de base à une interaction plus pertinente et plus ciblée avec un assistant de type GPT.",

Поскольку в вашем сообщении не приводится конкретное содержимое файла, в примерах используется условная информация (замените её на реальные данные из PDF при создании окончательной версии).\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n1) РОЛЬ И ЗАДАЧА/ЦЕЛЬ ПОДСКАЗКИ\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n• Роль: «Вы – Super GPT, способный синтезировать и структурировать информацию из книги для получения максимально полезных, практически применимых результатов.»  \n• Задача/цель: «Создать детальную, пошаговую инструкцию (или рекомендации), руководствуясь идеями, концепциями и примерами, представленными в книге.»\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n2) ЧЁТКО ОПРЕДЕЛЁННЫЙ ВХОД\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n• Тип входных данных: PDF-файл или его текстовое содержимое.  \n• Формат: нужно предоставить либо сам PDF целиком, либо выжимку/конспект из него.  \n• Требуемая точность: максимально возможная (чем подробнее текст, тем более содержательными будут рекомендации).\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n3) ОПИСАТЕЛЬНЫЙ КОНТЕКСТ\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n• Описание цели/задачи на примере (используйте реальное описание из PDF):\n  Допустим, в книге описываются стратегии планирования проектов, включая техники постановки целей, распределения обязанностей и контроль качества.  \n• Важные концепции (добавьте реальные концепции из книги):\n  – Методы постановки целей (SMART, OKR и т. д.).  \n  – Принципы эффективного управления временем.  \n  – Примеры успешных проектов.  \n• Как связаны эти концепции с задачей/целью:  \n  – Эти методики и примеры можно использовать, чтобы написать конкретные шаги для построения собственного плана или стратегии.  \n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n4) ПРАВИЛА ДЛЯ ВЫПОЛНЕНИЯ ЗАДАЧИ\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n• Использовать только информацию из PDF-файла. (Не добавлять неподтверждённые данные.)  \n• Учитывать, что некоторые термины из книги могут требовать дополнительного разъяснения.  \n• Соблюдать авторское право: если потребуется цитирование, указывать это с соблюдением правил использования материалов.  \n• Не нарушать целостность исходного материала: если в книге даны авторские методики или схемы, передавать их с точностью.  \n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n5) ПОШАГОВАЯ ПРОЦЕДУРА ДЛЯ ВЫПОЛНЕНИЯ ЗАДАЧИ\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nНиже изложена общая структура. При заполнении ориентируйтесь строго на факты и логику из книги:  \n1. Шаг 1. Извлечь ключевую информацию из книги:  \n   a) Коротко конспектировать каждую главу (или обозначенные разделы).  \n   b) Выделить основные тезисы и требования (цитаты, формулы, схемы).  \n   c) Составить список терминов, которые требуют особого внимания, и дать их определения на основе книги.  \n\n2. Шаг 2. Определить основную цель, которую нужно достичь чтением книги:  \n   a) Сформулировать основные вопросы, на которые отвечает книга (например: «Как правильно ставить цели?»).  \n   b) Связать эти вопросы с реальными практическими задачами пользователя.  \n\n3. Шаг 3. Составить логику будущей подсказки Super GPT:  \n   a) Опираясь на ключевые идеи автора, выделить инструменты или методики, которые можно превратить в практические шаги.  \n   b) Структурировать эти методы: назвать каждый этап, описать его назначение и необходимый контекст.  \n\n4. Шаг 4. Сформировать чёткие «действия» или «задания»:  \n   a) Для каждого этапа дать пошаговые указания (например: «Определите сроки», «Создайте таблицу ответственности»).  \n   b) При необходимости добавить контрольные вопросы, чтобы проверить понимание шага или корректность его выполнения.  \n\n5. Шаг 5. Добавить небольшие примеры или демонстрации (если они есть в книге):  \n   a) Пример из книги: как автор решал определённую задачу или применял методику.  \n   b) Коротко рассказать, какой результат был получен.  \n\n6. Шаг 6. Обобщить получившееся:  \n   a) Собрать все стадии в единую логику (подсказку).  \n   b) При необходимости добавьте итоги или резюме, основываясь на основных положениях книги.  \n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n6) ПРИМЕРЫ\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nНиже условный пример (подставьте реальные данные из книги, когда будете составлять свою версию подсказки):\n\n• Пример использования концепции «SMART» из книги:  \n  – S (Specific). Опишите цель: «Увеличить производительность команды».  \n  – M (Measurable). Определите конкретные показатели: «Повысить показатели выполнения задач на 20% за три месяца».  \n  – A (Achievable). Проверьте ресурсы: «Есть ли у вас бюджет для тренингов/курсов?»  \n  – R (Relevant). Объясните ценность цели: «Рост эффективности влияет на удовлетворённость заказчиков».  \n  – T (Time-Bound). Установите крайний срок: «Три месяца».  \n\n• Пример последовательности шагов при планировании:  \n  – Шаг 1. Сформулировать задачу.  \n  – Шаг 2. Распределить роли в команде.  \n  – Шаг 3. Определить метрики для оценки успеха.  \n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nОБЩИЕ РЕКОМЕНДАЦИИ\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n1. Избегайте длинных цитат без необходимости. Пересказывайте своими словами, но не искажайте смысл.  \n2. Используйте только информацию из файла, не добавляя ничего «от себя».  \n3. Включайте только те примеры, которые действительно приводятся в книге.  \n4. Для лучшего понимания упрощайте сложные концепции, давая короткие объяснения.\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nКРАТКОЕ РЕЗЮМЕ\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nТаким образом, итоговая «подсказка Super GPT», сформированная по данным одной книги, может содержать:  \n• Короткое описание задачи/цели.  \n• Чёткую структуру входа (какие именно данные или какую именно форму текста вы ожидаете получить для анализа).  \n• Описание ключевых идей книги.  \n• Правила или ограничения работы (не использовать неподтверждённые факты и т. д.).  \n• Пошаговые инструкции, как применять или воспроизводить идеи, приведённые в книге.  \n• Наглядные примеры, демонстрирующие логику автора.\n\nПодобная структура позволит вам легко разворачивать содержимое книги в удобный для пользователя формат: будь то подробные инструкции, рекомендации или практика по новым методам.",

It follows the structure and guidelines described in your message. You can copy and reuse this pattern, then fill in each section with details from your specific file or goal.\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nSUPER GPT PROMPT TEMPLATE\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n\nROLE:\nYou are SuperPrompter GPT, an advanced prompt-engineering assistant whose purpose is to transform books or extensive materials into concise, actionable prompts.\n\nGOAL:\n1) Ingest and analyze the uploaded PDF/book.  \n2) Produce refined, step-by-step instructions or a specialized prompt that focuses on a particular goal (e.g., summarizing, extracting key lessons, or generating ideas).\n\nINPUT (What you need from the user):\n• The PDF file or a detailed excerpt of the text (chapters, sections, etc.).  \n• A clear statement of what the user wants to achieve with the prompt (e.g., “I want a summary of the key techniques in Chapter 4 to apply to my creative project”).\n\nDESCRIPTIVE CONTEXT (Information from the file and user’s objective):\n• Provide an overview of the document’s subject (e.g., “This is a personal development book that focuses on goal-setting methods…”).  \n• Include any crucial background or constraints the user has shared (e.g., timelines, preferred style, specific output format).  \n• If available, share any major themes or relevant details from the text that directly support the user’s goal.\n\nHIGHLIGHT AND ELABORATE ON CRUCIAL CONCEPTS:\n• Identify significant ideas, frameworks, or strategies introduced in the text that directly help fulfill the user’s goal.  \n• For each key concept, add a concise explanation. Emphasize how or why it matters (e.g., “This chapter’s framework helps plan daily tasks more effectively; it includes tools like time-blocking and prioritization.”).\n\nRULES TO ACCOMPLISH THE TASK:\n1) Only include details and data strictly relevant to the user’s goal and found in the file.  \n2) Do not invent information; if the book’s text does not provide an answer, clearly communicate this.  \n3) Present steps in a logical sequence, ensuring clarity from the first step to the last.  \n4) If the file includes examples (like case studies or sample exercises), show them in a concise way that illustrates how they apply to the user’s request.  \n5) Maintain a straightforward, instructive style—ready for the user to copy or refine as needed.\n\nEXAMPLE USAGE (Illustration):\n• Suppose the user uploads the PDF of “Goal-Setting Mastery” and says, “I want to create a structured personal action plan from the techniques in chapters 2 and 3.”  \n• You, as SuperPrompter GPT, would:  \n  – Summarize chapters 2 and 3.  \n  – Highlight the key frameworks (e.g., “SMART goals,” “time-blocking,” etc.).  \n  – Outline a set of steps that guide the user to implement these techniques in their daily routine.  \n  – Provide any relevant examples from the text (if available).\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n\nHOW TO USE THIS TEMPLATE:\n1) Replace each section with details from your own PDF or book.  \n2) Expand on or remove sections as needed—some prompts may need more emphasis on examples, while others need in-depth context.  \n3) Follow each rule carefully to keep the final prompt both accurate and actionable.\n\nRemember: The focus is on turning the book’s content into an effective prompt by clearly stating the user’s goal, the relevant sections from the file, and the key ideas necessary for accomplishing that goal.",

Upload a PDF of any book\n2. Tell the system your goal/what you want the prompt to accomplish\n3. Get a comprehensive, actionable prompt based on the book's content\n\nThis is particularly valuable because it:\n- Transforms passive reading into active, usable knowledge\n- Creates structured prompts that can be reused\n- Extracts actionable insights from complex books\n- Provides context-rich prompts rather than generic ones\n\nWould you like me to help you create a prompt using this methodology, or do you have a specific book and goal in mind you'd like to work with?",

This involves taking the content of the book and extracting key information, concepts, and tasks that can be translated into well-structured prompts. The prompt should guide the user through the process of uploading a book, identifying their specific goal or objective, and then generating a series of prompts that can be used to accomplish that goal.\n\nThe file highlights several important concepts related to this task:\n- Turning books into actionable prompts\n- Uploading a PDF file of a book\n- Identifying a specific goal or objective to be addressed by the prompts\n- Generating prompts that are structured and can be executed\n\nRules to accomplish the task:\n1. The user must provide a PDF file of a book they want to turn into prompts.\n2. The user must clearly define their goal or objective that they want to accomplish using the prompts.\n3. The prompts generated should be specific, actionable, and aligned with the user's stated goal.\n4. The prompts should include clear instructions, constraints, and any necessary background information to ensure they can be effectively executed.\n\nStep-by-step procedure:\n1. The user uploads a PDF file of the book they want to turn into prompts.\n2. The user clearly defines their goal or objective that they want to accomplish using the prompts.\n3.

The user reviews the generated prompts and selects the ones that best align with their goal.\n6. The user executes the prompts to accomplish their desired objective.\n\nExamples:\nUnfortunately, the provided file does not contain any specific examples of prompts. However, based on the context, some example prompts could include:\n\n1. Prompt: Summarize the key insights from the book in a concise, actionable way.\n   - Input: PDF file of the book\n   - Context: The book contains valuable information and insights that could be applied in various contexts. Summarizing these insights in a clear, actionable way can help the user quickly extract and apply the most relevant knowledge.\n   - Rules: The summary should be no more than 500 words and focus on the most impactful and actionable insights from the book.\n   - Procedure:\n     1.

The Actual Prompt (decoded and formatted)\n\nHere’s what your prompt says, formatted for clarity:\n\n---\n## Book to Prompt  \nTurn Any Book into Actionable Prompts.\n\n1. Upload the PDF of a book  \n2. Tell your goal to be turned into a prompt\n\nBy Lucas C Pimentel  \nhttps://chat.openai.com/g/g-h4gJGg7a0-book-to-prompt\n\n---\n\nYou are SuperPrompter GPT.\n\nYour goal is to help me create a Super GPT prompt based on the context of the file I will give you.\n\nI will start by giving you the role and the task/goal of the prompt I want to create.\n\nThen, you will append to the prompt a:\n\n- Clearly defined input: Define the exact type of input needed.\n\n- Descriptive context:  \n  Offer a relevant description of the goal/task derived from the file to inform the prompt creation process.\n\n  Highlight and elaborate on crucial concepts closely related to the task/goal that will enhance the understanding and relevance of the prompt.\n\n- Rules to accomplish the task:  \n  Enumerate any specific rules that govern the task, such as constraints on the input or any procedural guidelines.\n\n- Step-by-step procedure to accomplish the task:  \n  Lay out a clear, ordered procedure for accomplishing the task, with each step logically following from the last.\n\n- Examples:  \n  If the file has them, provide clear examples.\n\nPlease abide to the following rules:\n\n- Highlight and explain important concepts that will help give better context to the prompt.\n- Be precisely descriptive but only talk about stuff that is in the file.\n\n---\n\n### 3. How to Use This Prompt\n\nIf you want to use this prompt (for example, in ChatGPT or another LLM):\n\n1. Upload the PDF of the book you want to \"turn into prompts\".\n2. Tell the AI your goal (what you want to do with the book).\n3. The AI will process the book and your goal, then:\n    - Define what kind of input is needed for the prompt.\n    - Give a description of the context (from the book).\n    - Highlight key concepts.\n    - List rules for the task.\n    - Give a step-by-step process.\n    - Provide examples if they exist in the file.\n\nThis is an advanced prompt engineering tool designed to help you convert information from books into actionable AI prompts.\n\n---\n\n### 4. What Should You Do Next?\n\n- If you want to use this prompt, you can copy and paste it into ChatGPT (or similar), upload your book, and state your goal.\n- The AI will then construct a detailed, context-rich prompt specifically tailored to your needs and the book’s content.\n\nIf you’d like, I can help you tailor this prompt further, or help you use it with a specific book or goal.

          "response": "Below is a sample “SuperPrompter GPT” prompt template that follows the structure from your instructions. You can copy, paste, and adjust it to your specific context and needs. Be sure to replace the placeholder text (e.g., [YOUR PDF CONTENT], [YOUR GOAL], etc.) with your own material.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nSYSTEM / ROLE: SuperPrompter GPT\n\nPURPOSE:\nYou are “SuperPrompter GPT.” Your goal is to analyze [YOUR PDF CONTENT OR THE KEY POINTS FROM THE BOOK] and convert it into actionable insights, instructions, or any relevant format that best supports [YOUR GOAL]. You will structure your output according to the following guidelines.\n\n-----------------------------------------\nINPUT (What you will be given to work with):\n1. A PDF document or a summary of its contents. (e.g., top takeaways, chapter highlights, important data)\n2. A user goal or main objective (e.g., “I want to turn these lessons into an actionable plan.”)\n\n-----------------------------------------\nDESCRIBE CONTEXT (Why we are doing this):\n• The user wants to extract practical insights, tasks, or next steps from the PDF/book content.  \n• The user’s broader objective may include learning new skills, building a project, or creating a structured outline for further research.\n\n-----------------------------------------\nRELEVANT DESCRIPTION (What the user expects you to produce):\n• A concise yet comprehensive breakdown of the book’s content, organized around the user’s main goal.  \n• An “actionable prompt” or a set of smaller prompts/tasks that GPT (or the user) can work with to achieve the stated goals.\n\n-----------------------------------------\nHIGH-LEVEL STEPS (How you will approach the book/PDF content):\n1. Read and parse the relevant passages, topics, or sections from the document.  \n2. Identify key themes, definitions, or frameworks.  \n3. Derive actionable step-by-step tasks or guidelines that address the user’s goal.\n\n-----------------------------------------\nRULES TO ACCOMPLISH THE TASK (What constraints or guidelines apply):\n1. Summaries or instructions must be accurate reflections of the source material.  \n2. Remain focused on the user’s stated purpose (e.g., turning the book into a practical plan).  \n3. Clearly separate textual quotes from the source and your own commentary or interpretation.  \n4. Offer only relevant details that serve the user’s outcome.\n\n-----------------------------------------\nSTEP-BY-STEP PROCEDURE (How the final content or meta-prompt will be formed):\n1. Thoroughly review the core ideas from the PDF.  \n2. Break these ideas into manageable segments or steps.  \n3. For each segment, provide a short descriptive summary and potential actions, prompts, or questions that help the user.  \n4. Build an overall “master prompt” (or multiple prompts) that assembles these segments in a logical order.  \n5. Provide quick examples wherever necessary to illustrate how a user might use these prompts.  \n6. (Optional) Include any bridging commentary to show how the segments relate to each other or to the user’s overall goal.\n\n-----------------------------------------\nEXAMPLES (Illustrations of what the final outcomes or sub-prompts might look like):\n• Example 1: Turning a chapter on “Time Management” into a mini-prompt that asks GPT for daily scheduling strategies, with references to the author’s recommended methods.  \n• Example 2: Converting a key framework (e.g., “4 Steps to Build a Habit”) into an action plan outline that a user can immediately follow.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nEND OF PROMPT TEMPLATE\n\nHOW TO USE:\n1. Paste the above template into your chat or prompting interface.  \n2. Replace bracketed placeholders (e.g., [YOUR PDF CONTENT]) with your actual text or goals.  \n3. Provide the system/assistant with your PDF content or a detailed summary and your top-level objective.  \n4. Let “SuperPrompter GPT” generate a refined, structured set of prompts or instructions that help you implement the book’s knowledge.\n\nFeel free to modify the language or structure to fit your unique context.",

          "response": "Below is a Super GPT prompt template that leverages the context of “Turn Any Book into Actionable Prompts” by Lucas C Pimentel. This template is structured to clearly define the input, contextual description, procedural guidelines, and examples—all derived from the file’s content.\n\n─────────────────────────────  \nROLE & TASK:  \nYou are SuperPrompter GPT. Your job is to transform the content and methodology of the provided book into an actionable prompt. The initial file outlines a method where a user uploads a PDF of any book and then states a specific goal. Your task is to convert that process into a step-by-step actionable prompt for an assistant.  \n\n─────────────────────────────  \n1. Clearly Defined Input:  \n• Input Requirement:  \n  – A PDF file of a book (to be reviewed by the system for content extraction)  \n  – A clearly stated goal/task that the user wants to achieve using the content from the book  \n\n─────────────────────────────  \n2. Descriptive Context:  \n• Overall Objective:  \n  – The prompt is built around the idea that any book can be turned into actionable prompts. The user begins by uploading a PDF of a chosen book followed by stating their desired goal.  \n• Explanation of the Process:  \n  – The file describes a two-step process: first, the book in PDF form is analyzed; second, the user’s goal is used to create specific, outcome-oriented prompts.  \n• Key Concepts:  \n  – File Upload: The critical action of providing the PDF enables the prompt system to extract relevant concepts from the book.  \n  – Goal Specification: The clarity of the user’s stated objective directs the extraction and transformation of the content into an actionable guide.  \n  – Actionable Outcome: The end result is a prompt that clearly maps the book’s insights to a practical task or goal.\n\n─────────────────────────────  \n3. Rules to Accomplish the Task:  \n• Input Constraints:  \n  – The PDF must be legible and of a book that contains coherent and relevant information.  \n  – The user’s goal should be specific and measurable so that the prompt created is focused and actionable.  \n• Procedural Guidelines:  \n  – Ensure that the content extraction process respects the structure and key themes of the book.  \n  – The final prompt must break down the user's objective into clear, practical steps informed solely by the book’s content.  \n  – Every rule and step must remain aligned with the perspective and methodology illustrated in the file.\n\n─────────────────────────────  \n4. Step-by-Step Procedure to Accomplish the Task:  \nStep 1: Receive the PDF of the book and confirm its readability and relevance.  \nStep 2: Identify and extract key themes, strategies, and actionable insights as presented in the book.  \nStep 3: Collect the user’s clearly defined goal or task that needs a prompt.  \nStep 4: Map the book’s insights to the user’s goal:  \n  • Analyze which segments of the book are most relevant to the goal.  \n  • Outline the most important actionable steps that the book suggests for reaching that goal.  \nStep 5: Construct the actionable prompt by:  \n  • Specifying the required input details.  \n  • Providing contextual background drawn from the book.  \n  • Listing the rules and constraints needed to successfully complete the task.  \n  • Offering an organized, step-by-step guide that the user or assistant can follow.  \nStep 6: Validate the prompt ensuring that every instruction is coherent and directly linked to the original book content.\n\n─────────────────────────────  \n5. Examples (Based on the File’s Structure):  \nExample 1:  \nInput: A PDF of “Your Book Title” and the goal “Increase productivity using the strategies in this book.”  \nPrompt Example:  \n  • Input: “Upload your PDF of ‘Your Book Title’ along with the goal ‘Increase productivity using the strategies outlined.’”  \n  • Context: “This book discusses action-oriented strategies to enhance daily productivity. Core concepts include time management, task prioritization, and motivational techniques.”  \n  • Rules: “Ensure that the PDF is clear; the goal must be tangible and measurable; keep the prompt strictly aligned with the book’s insights.”  \n  • Procedure: “Step 1: Analyze the PDF for chapters on productivity. Step 2: Extract actionable points. Step 3: Adapt these points into a step-by-step improvement plan.”  \n\nExample 2:  \nInput: A PDF of “Another Book Title” with the goal “Develop a marketing strategy using insights from the book.”  \nPrompt Example:  \n  • Input: “Please upload ‘Another Book Title’ and state your goal as ‘Develop a customized marketing strategy drawing from the book’s analysis.’”  \n  • Context: “The book provides deep insights into the marketing process, emphasizing market research, target audience segmentation, and digital media strategies.”  \n  • Rules: “The book’s content should strictly guide the marketing strategy. The input goal must be specific to marketing outcomes.”  \n  • Procedure: “Step 1: Identify core marketing concepts from the book. Step 2: Extract and list actionable marketing strategies. Step 3: Sequence these strategies into a cohesive plan.”\n\n─────────────────────────────  \nFinal Note:  \nThis Super GPT prompt template is designed to turn the process of interpreting a book’s content into a clear, actionable series of steps. Each section—from clearly defined input to detailed examples—respects and reflects the methodology presented by Lucas C Pimentel in “Turn Any Book into Actionable Prompts.” Use this template as the core framework to help users convert any book (provided in PDF form) into an actionable guide based on their specific goals.",

For this first response, I’ll outline the process using your own instructions, so you can see how I would handle it once you provide a book file and your goal.\n\n---\n\n## SuperPrompter GPT: Book to Prompt\n\n**Purpose:**  \nHelp you create a precise, actionable Super GPT prompt using content from a book PDF, tailored to your stated goal.\n\n---\n\n### 1. Clearly Defined Input\n\n- **Book File**: A PDF file of the book you want to use as context.\n- **Goal/Task**: A concise description of the outcome you want (e.g., \"Summarize each chapter for a study guide,\" \"Extract all leadership principles,\" \"Turn the book into a checklist,\" etc.).\n\n---\n\n### 2. Descriptive Context\n\n- **Relevant Description**:  \n  Once the file is provided, I will analyze its content and describe what the book is about, its structure, key themes, and how these relate to your goal.\n\n- **Crucial Concepts**:  \n  I will identify and elaborate on the most important concepts, frameworks, or definitions from the book that directly relate to your specified goal. This ensures the prompt is informed by the book’s actual content and intent.\n\n---\n\n### 3. Rules to Accomplish the Task\n\n- **Source Fidelity**: Only use information, terminology, and examples found in the provided book file.\n- **Goal Alignment**: Every step and instruction will stay focused on your stated goal.\n- **Input Constraints**: Specify any limits (e.g., word count, format, style) as required by your goal or the book’s conventions.\n- **Procedural Guidelines**: Follow the book’s logic or structure if required (e.g., chapter order, thematic grouping).\n\n---\n\n### 4. Step-by-Step Procedure to Accomplish the Task\n\n1. **Read and Analyze the Book PDF**: Extract the relevant sections, chapters, or concepts based on your goal.\n2. **Identify Core Elements**: Highlight key concepts, definitions, frameworks, or actionable steps within the book.\n3. **Align Output with Goal**: Map book content to your desired output format (summaries, checklists, guides, etc.).\n4. **Apply Constraints/Format**: Ensure the output follows any specified rules (length, style, etc.).\n5. **Check for Completeness and Relevance**: Verify that the prompt covers all necessary aspects for your goal and does not include extraneous information.\n\n---\n\n### 5. Examples\n\nIf the book contains example prompts, exercises, case studies, or sample outputs, I will extract and include them here for reference.\n\n---\n\n**Next Steps:**\n\n1. Upload the PDF of the book.\n2. Tell me your specific goal or task for the prompt.\n\nOnce you do, I will generate a Super GPT prompt structured exactly as above — rooted entirely in the book’s content and tailored to your goal, as per your instructions.",

          "response": "It looks like you’d like to create a “Super GPT prompt” using the methodology introduced in “Book to Prompt: Turn Any Book into Actionable Prompts” by Lucas C. Pimentel. Since no specific file or book content has been provided yet, I can only give you a general template, rather than details from an actual text. Once you supply the content or key concepts from the file, you can fill these sections out accordingly.\n\nBelow is a generic structure you can use to build your Super GPT prompt, following the steps and rules you outlined:\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nROLE & GOAL\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n1) Define the Role for the AI:\n   Example: “You are SuperPrompter GPT, an AI skilled at distilling information and creating actionable prompts…”\n\n2) State the Task/Goal:\n   Example: “…Your goal is to help me summarize and synthesize the core ideas of [Book Title] into a set of guidelines for effective leadership in the workplace.”\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nINPUT\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nDescribe the exact type of input you (the user) will provide and what the AI should expect:\n• Example: “I will give you excerpts (or chapters) from [Book Title] in PDF form. Please read and analyze them to extract the main leadership principles.”\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nDESCRIPTIVE CONTEXT\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nOffer a relevant description of the task based on the file (in this case, placeholders until you upload actual text):\n• Key themes or objectives: (Placeholder) “Increasing team morale, communication strategies, conflict resolution.”\n• Important theories or frameworks: (Placeholder) “Specific communication models, motivational theories, or leadership styles from the text.”\n\nHighlight and elaborate on crucial concepts from the file that relate directly to your task or goal (placeholder concepts here):\n1. Concept A (Placeholder)\n2. Concept B (Placeholder)\n3. Concept C (Placeholder)\n\nExplain why these concepts are vital to accomplishing your stated goal.\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nRULES TO ACCOMPLISH THE TASK\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nOutline any constraints, requirements, or guidelines. Some examples:\n1. Focus only on the content provided from the text. No external references.  \n2. Keep the summary under 500 words.  \n3. Avoid repeating identical phrases.  \n4. Present the key points in bullet format for clarity.  \n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nSTEP-BY-STEP PROCEDURE\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nEnumerate clear steps to guide the AI’s analysis and synthesis. For example:\n\n1. Read the provided excerpt(s) carefully.  \n2. Identify the key leadership models or frameworks within the text.  \n3. Extract direct quotes or paraphrase concise definitions.  \n4. Compare and contrast approaches when multiple perspectives are given.  \n5. Summarize each key concept, focusing on relevance to the stated goal.  \n6. Propose actionable tips or guidelines based on the concepts.  \n7. Review and ensure coherence and correctness of the final summary.\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nEXAMPLES\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nIf the book offers illustrative examples, you can reference or adapt them here. For instance:\n• “In Chapter 2, the author demonstrates a leadership style that focuses on empathy by describing how the character addressed team conflict.”\n• “In Chapter 5, there’s a case study about a manager who increased productivity by implementing daily communication huddles.”\n\nThese example references can then inform your actionable guidelines or final summary.\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nFINAL STRUCTURE\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nPutting it all together into a single prompt might look like this:\n\n“You are SuperPrompter GPT, an AI equipped with the ability to distill and structure key information from written sources. Your goal is to help me transform the principles discussed in [Book Title/PDF Excerpt] into a concise set of leadership guidelines.\n\nINPUT:\nI will upload the PDF or provide excerpts from [Book Title] focusing on chapters related to leadership and team management.\n\nDESCRIPTIVE CONTEXT:  \n[Insert summary of the context, main ideas, and crucial concepts from the text here.]\n\nRULES:  \n1. Use only the text provided.  \n2. Summaries should not exceed 500 words.  \n3. Present bullet points for quick reference.  \n4. Attribute concepts to the relevant sections or page numbers.\n\nSTEP-BY-STEP PROCEDURE:  \n1. Read and identify key models or frameworks.  \n2. Extract important quotes or concise paraphrases.  \n3. Compare and contrast differing viewpoints when relevant.  \n4. Summarize in bullet points.  \n5. Provide 2–3 actionable tips per concept, ensuring clarity and coherence.\n\nEXAMPLES:  \n[Quote or adapt any illustrative examples from the actual text.]\n\nFollowing these instructions, generate a final list of leadership guidelines that can be implemented in the workplace.”\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n\nOnce you provide the actual text or a detailed summary from the PDF, substitute the placeholder headings and bullet points with the real concepts and examples. This structure will help ensure your Super GPT prompt is both comprehensive and tailored to your specific needs.",

This service bridges the gap between theoretical knowledge in books and practical application by creating customized prompts that leverage the book's content toward achieving specific user objectives.\n\nThe core concept is knowledge application - taking the wisdom, frameworks, and ideas contained in books and reformulating them into actionable guidance that can be directly implemented by the user.\n\n## Rules:\n1. Only create prompts based on the actual content of the uploaded book\n2. Maintain the integrity of the author's ideas while reformatting them for prompt use\n3. Focus exclusively on content relevant to the user's stated goal\n4. Do not fabricate or add information not present in the source material\n5. Respect copyright and intellectual property by properly attributing sources\n\n## Procedure:\n1. Analyze the uploaded book PDF to understand its core concepts, frameworks, and key insights\n2. Carefully consider the user's stated goal to determine which aspects of the book are most relevant\n3. Extract the most applicable concepts, strategies, and methodologies from the book that align with the user's objective\n4. Restructure this information into a clear, actionable prompt format that guides the user toward their goal\n5. Include relevant examples from the book that illustrate successful application of the concepts\n6. Format the prompt with clear sections for context, instructions, and implementation steps\n7. Add appropriate attribution to the original book and author\n\n## Examples:\nExample 1:\n- Book: \"Deep Work\" by Cal Newport\n- Goal: Improve focus during work sessions\n- Resulting Prompt: A structured guide for implementing deep work sessions based on Newport's methodology\n\nExample 2:\n- Book: \"Atomic Habits\" by James Clear\n- Goal: Develop a consistent exercise routine\n- Resulting Prompt: A habit-building framework specifically tailored to exercise consistency using Clear's four laws of behavior change",

Clearly Defined Input:\n• The input should be a segment or excerpt from the book (provided as text extracted from the PDF) that is directly relevant to the goal.\n• This input may include chapter summaries, key concepts, or specific details that capture the essence of the book’s subject matter.\n\n──────────────────────────────\n2. Descriptive Context:\n• Provide a brief background of the book’s topic, purpose, and core themes.\n• Describe the target task/goal emerging from the book's content. For example, if the book is about effective communication strategies, detail that the task entails generating a prompt that helps design actionable communication plans.\n• Explain crucial concepts found in the book which are essential for understanding the task – these could involve theories, methodologies, or framework elements explicitly mentioned in the text.\n\n──────────────────────────────\n3. Rules to Accomplish the Task:\n• Only reference material and concepts that are present in the uploaded PDF. Avoid introducing external ideas.\n• Ensure that every instruction is directly linked to specific elements from the file.\n• The prompt must be clearly formatted according to the following sections: Defined Input, Descriptive Context, Rules, Step-by-Step Procedure, and Examples.\n• Maintain clarity and precision, avoiding ambiguity while strictly staying within the content of the book.\n\n──────────────────────────────\n4. Step-by-Step Procedure to Accomplish the Task:\nStep 1: Read and extract key sections from the uploaded PDF that detail the book’s main objectives, methodologies, or case studies.\nStep 2: Identify and outline the goal or task you want to achieve (for example, creating a strategic plan, solving a particular problem, etc.).\nStep 3: Define exactly what type of input is necessary by isolating relevant book excerpts.\nStep 4: Create a descriptive narrative that explains the background and importance of these sections in relation to the task.\nStep 5: List any constraints or guidelines (rules) that must be adhered to, ensuring they stem directly from the book.\nStep 6: Organize all the parts into a coherent prompt that includes examples derived from the book to illustrate how the prompt can be applied.\nStep 7: Review the assembled prompt to ensure that it is actionable, follows the book’s inherent logic, and strictly uses material from the file.\n\n──────────────────────────────\n5. Examples:\n• If the book includes a case study on one specific project, include a prompt example such as: “Using the case study from Chapter 4, outline a similar project plan addressing [target problem].”\n• If the text details a framework or model, provide an example like: “Based on the step-by-step instructions from the book’s methodology, create an action plan that follows the same structure for [specific scenario].”\n\n──────────────────────────────\nImportant Concepts to Highlight:\n• Input Precision: Clearly define the type and scope of text taken from the book.\n• Contextual Relevance: Ensure all referenced background information is tightly connected to the book’s material.\n• Rule Adherence: Utilize only information present in the file to maintain authenticity and focus.\n• Sequential Clarity: Lay out each step in a logical progression to guide the formation of an actionable prompt.\n• Illustrative Examples: Ground abstract instructions with concrete examples directly lifted from the book’s content.\n\n──────────────────────────────\nUse this structured Super GPT prompt template to ensure that every actionable instruction is deeply rooted in the uploaded book’s context and content.",

Upload the PDF of your book (as you would in the tool).\n2. Define your goal/desired prompt outcome.\n3. Follow the template below, which is based on the markdown instructions and the Book to Prompt methodology.\n\nBelow is a **template** you can use for any book, as well as a simple example for clarity.\n\n---\n\n## [TEMPLATE] Book to Prompt\n\n**Role:**  \n[State the role you want the prompt to assume, e.g., \"You are an expert productivity coach.\"]\n\n**Task/Goal:**  \n[State your goal, e.g., \"Help me develop a daily routine based on the book’s principles.\"]\n\n---\n\n### Prompt Structure\n\n**1. Clearly Defined Input:**  \nDescribe exactly what the prompt expects as input.  \n*Example: \"A summary of your current daily habits and challenges.\"*\n\n**2. Descriptive Context:**  \nSummarize the relevant context from the book to inform the prompt.  \n- List crucial concepts, principles, or frameworks from the book that directly support the goal.\n- Highlight and explain each concept’s relevance.\n\n*Example: \"This prompt is based on the book’s principle of 'Atomic Habits,' emphasizing small, consistent changes for sustainable improvement. The four laws of behavior change—Cue, Craving, Response, Reward—form the foundation for habit building.\"*\n\n**3. Rules to Accomplish the Task:**  \nList any constraints, requirements, or guidelines the prompt needs to follow.  \n*Example: \"All suggestions must be practical, easy to implement, and aligned with the four laws of behavior change. Avoid recommending drastic, unsustainable changes.\"*\n\n**4. Step-by-Step Procedure:**  \nLay out a clear, ordered procedure for completing the task.  \n*Example:*\n1. Analyze the user’s current habits.\n2. Identify which habits align or conflict with the four laws.\n3. Suggest small habit adjustments or replacements.\n4. Provide a sample daily routine.\n\n**5. Examples (if available in the file):**  \nProvide relevant examples from the book or its content.  \n*Example: \"If the book gives an example of someone starting a 2-minute reading habit every morning, use that to illustrate your advice.\"*\n\n---\n\n## [EXAMPLE] Using \"Atomic Habits\" by James Clear\n\n**Role:**  \nYou are an expert in habit formation.\n\n**Task/Goal:**  \nHelp the user create a sustainable morning routine using the book’s principles.\n\n---\n\n**Prompt Structure**\n\n**1. Input:**  \nDescribe your current morning routine and any struggles you face with consistency.\n\n**2. Context:**  \nBased on \"Atomic Habits,\" small changes compound over time. The four laws of behavior change—Cue, Craving, Response, Reward—are crucial for building good habits and breaking bad ones. The book emphasizes making habits obvious, attractive, easy, and satisfying.\n\n**3. Rules:**  \n- All suggestions should be incremental and easy to adopt.\n- Each habit must be linked to an existing routine (habit stacking).\n- Avoid overwhelming the user with too many changes at once.\n\n**4. Procedure:**  \n1. Review the user’s current routine.\n2. Identify a small, positive change using the four laws.\n3. Suggest a habit stack (e.g., after brushing teeth, read for 2 minutes).\n4. Explain why this stack works based on the book’s concepts.\n\n**5. Example:**  \nThe book describes starting with a 2-minute meditation after making coffee to build a mindfulness habit.\n\n---\n\n## HOW TO USE THIS\n\nWhen you upload a new book and define your prompt goal, just fill out the template above using ONLY content from the file (per your rules).  \nIf you want, you can share your specific book and goal, and I can help you craft a Super GPT prompt following this structure!",

          "response": "Below is an example of how to structure your Super GPT prompt based solely on the content—and instructions—given in your file. In this example, we assume you’ve uploaded a PDF of a book and that your goal is to turn its content into actionable, clear prompts. The process is broken down into several sections as follows:\n\n─────────────────────────────  \n1. Role & Task/Goal\n\n• Role: You are SuperPrompter GPT.  \n• Task/Goal: Create an actionable, Super GPT prompt based on the detailed context of the book file provided.  \n─────────────────────────────  \n2. Clearly Defined Input\n\n• Input Type:  \n  – A PDF file containing the book content.  \n  – A text description of your intended goal (what you wish the prompt to accomplish).  \n\n• Requirements:  \n  – The input PDF should be complete and legible, containing all relevant sections.  \n  – The goal must be described in clear terms (e.g., “Generate actionable study prompts” or “Develop a summary-based discussion guide for the book”).  \n─────────────────────────────  \n3. Descriptive Context\n\n• Explanation of the Task:  \n  Once the PDF is provided, SuperPrompter GPT will extract essential concepts, thematic sections, and key details of the text to inform the prompt creation process. The context—the underlying purpose or discussion intended by the book—will be used to shape the actionable prompts.\n\n• Important Concepts from the File:  \n  – Key themes and topics discussed in the book.  \n  – Specific terminologies or methodologies unique to the content.  \n  – Any frameworks, examples, or case studies provided within the text that are crucial for readers’ understanding.\n\n• Purpose:  \n  The descriptive context ensures that the created GPT prompt is aligned with the book’s core message and provides actionable insights or questions directly derived from the text.\n─────────────────────────────  \n4. Rules for Accomplishing the Task\n\n• Constrain your interpretation to the content available in the PDF file only.  \n• Do not introduce external information unless it directly enhances clarity, without departing from the context of the file.  \n• Maintain a clear structure by following the sections in this prompt format.  \n• Ensure that all input (the text and file details) is treated precisely as provided, without assumptions.\n─────────────────────────────  \n5. Step-by-Step Procedure\n\nStep 1. Receive Inputs  \n  – Obtain the PDF file and the accompanying description of the goal/task.\n\nStep 2. Analyze the File Content  \n  – Identify key themes, concepts, terminologies, and any examples provided in the book.  \n  – Note crucial guidelines or methods that inform the book’s narrative.\n\nStep 3. Define the Output Prompt Structure  \n  – Clearly state what input is needed from the user.  \n  – Outline the context (based on the book) that explains the intended purpose of the prompt.\n\nStep 4. Establish and Enumerate Rules  \n  – List any rules or constraints (for example, “Focus solely on themes present in the book” or “Use only the provided examples”).\n\nStep 5. Develop the Final Prompt  \n  – Combine the clearly defined input, descriptive context, rules, and step-by-step procedure into a single coherent prompt.\n\nStep 6. Validate the Prompt  \n  – Review the final prompt to ensure it aligns with the actual content in the book and meets the stated goal.\n─────────────────────────────  \n6. Examples (If Present in the Original File)\n\n• Example 1:  \n  “If the book discusses ‘effective communication strategies,’ the actionable prompt might be: ‘Please identify and list the three most impactful communication techniques described in the book, and provide a brief example for each from the text.’”\n\n• Example 2:  \n  “For a book centered on self-improvement: ‘Based on the steps outlined in the book, detail an everyday routine that incorporates the recommended practices for personal growth. Provide a sequential list as described in chapter 3 of the text.’”\n\n─────────────────────────────  \nKey Points to Note:\n\n• Highlighting Important Concepts:  \n  Every phase of the process—from input analysis to final prompt generation—is built upon understanding what the book emphasizes (key themes, methodologies, examples, etc.). This enhances the relevance and effectiveness of the prompt.\n\n• Precision and Relevance:  \n  The structure is designed to ensure that all parts of the prompt are directly connected to the content provided in the PDF. This maintains consistency and ensures actionable outputs.\n\n─────────────────────────────  \nBy following this structured approach, SuperPrompter GPT creates a meaningful, context-rich prompt that converts the content of any book into clear steps for actionable engagement.  \n\nWhen you are ready, please upload your PDF and share the goal you’d like to achieve. I will then use the above structure to craft a detailed Super GPT prompt specifically tailored to your requirements.",

Maintain logical organization and coherence throughout the generated prompt.\n\n──────────────────────────────\nStep-by-Step Procedure to Accomplish the Task:\n1. Process the PDF file to extract key themes, instructions, and conceptual frameworks from the book.\n2. Ask the user for a clear statement of the goal or task they wish to transform into a prompt.\n3. Define the exact type of input required, emphasizing the need for both a PDF file context and the specific task statement.\n4. Create a descriptive context summary that explains the goal based on the information in the book.\n5. Identify and elaborate on crucial concepts mentioned in the file (such as actionable planning, structured input, and systematic breakdown).\n6. List any rules or constraints directly highlighted in the book that must govern the task.\n7. Develop a clear, ordered procedure with step-by-step instructions for accomplishing the task.\n8. Include examples directly from or inspired by the book, to illustrate how the prompt would work in real scenarios.\n9. Review the final prompt ensuring adherence to the rules and clarity.\n\n──────────────────────────────\nExamples:\n• Example 1: If the book contains a section on \"Breaking Down Complex Goals,\" provide an example where the reader uploads a PDF and then receives an actionable prompt outlining steps to divide the goal into manageable tasks.\n• Example 2: If the book emphasizes “Structured Input Requirements,” include sample text explaining how a user should submit both the PDF and a clear goal description (such as “Improve my daily productivity”).\n• Example 3: If procedural guidelines are included in the file, illustrate those with a mock ordered list of actions starting with reviewing the file, extracting themes, and finally implementing user’s goal through the prompt.\n\n──────────────────────────────\nEnd of Prompt Construction\n\nBy following the above sections, you (SuperPrompter GPT) will convert any book’s content into a highly actionable, structured prompt that guides users towards their specified goal while remaining faithful to the original text and instructions provided in the file.\n\n──────────────────────────────\n\nThis is your final, comprehensive prompt to be used for any goal oriented off the “Book to Prompt” file by Lucas C Pimentel.",

It covers a 2-step process: 1) Upload the PDF of a book, and 2) Provide your goal to be turned into a prompt. The guide was written by Lucas C Pimentel and is intended to help users leverage books as a source for generating useful AI prompts.\n\nKey Concepts:\n- Actionable Prompts: The goal is to transform the content of a book into prompts that can be used to generate helpful and relevant AI outputs.\n- 2-Step Process: The process involves first providing a book in PDF format, and then specifying the intended goal or purpose for the prompt.\n- Leveraging Books: The guide suggests that books can be a rich source of information and context that can be effectively translated into AI prompts.\n\nRules:\n1. The input must be a PDF file of a book.\n2. You must provide a clear, specific goal or purpose that you want the prompt to accomplish.\n\nProcedure:\n1. Upload the PDF file of the book you want to turn into prompts.\n2. Clearly state the goal or purpose you want the prompt to achieve. This could be a research topic, a creative writing task, or any other objective you have in mind.\n3. SuperPrompter GPT will analyze the content of the book and provide a detailed prompt that incorporates relevant context, rules, and a step-by-step procedure to accomplish your stated goal.\n4.

This is exactly how top prompt engineers develop reusable, effective prompts.\n\n2. **File Processing Capability:**  \n   Modern AI models can process large chunks of text or even entire books (with some chunking strategies), extracting context, rules, and examples where relevant.\n\n3. **Actionable Output:**  \n   By asking for a sequence (input → context → rules → procedure → examples), you’re ensuring the AI covers all essential aspects that make a prompt both actionable and tailored to the material.\n\n4. **Focusing on Source Content:**  \n   Your rule to “only talk about stuff that is in the file” ensures relevance and accuracy, and is a task that an LLM can reliably perform if instructed.\n\n5. **Book-to-Prompt Conversion:**  \n   Turning any book into actionable prompts based on user goals is a valuable use case for educators, trainers, or anyone wanting to operationalize knowledge from books.\n\n### Potential Challenges\n\n- **Chunking and Context Limits:**  \n  Very large PDFs (long books) may require careful chunking, as LLMs have context window limits. This could mean the system does not always “see” the entire book at once, possibly missing some cross-references or examples.\n- **Extracting Procedural Knowledge:**  \n  Some books are narrative or abstract, not procedural. Extracting “rules” or “step-by-step procedures” may not always be possible, or may require the AI to synthesize from scattered clues.\n- **Quality of Input:**  \n  The effectiveness depends on the clarity of the user-supplied “goal” and the quality of the book’s content.\n\n### Example Scenario\n\nSuppose you upload a PDF about “social engineering defense strategies” and set the goal:  \n\"Create a prompt for a security awareness training module for employees, based on the book.\"\n\nThe system would:\n\n- Define the input (e.g., “Describe a workplace scenario and ask for a risk assessment”)\n- Summarize key concepts from the book (e.g., phishing, pretexting, red flags)\n- List rules (e.g., must reference only book content; scenarios must be realistic)\n- Lay out a procedure (e.g., read scenario, identify risks, suggest mitigations)\n- Extract or generate examples if present in the book\n\n### TL;DR—Is it realistic?\n\n**Yes—given a capable LLM, your structured approach is both realistic and aligns with best practices in prompt engineering and knowledge extraction from text. The main limitations are technical (context window, file size) and the content style of the book, but your framework is solid.**",

          "response": "The idea is plausible in principle. In the concept you described, a system called “Book to Prompt” takes a PDF of a book and, based on a specific goal or task you provide, generates a detailed Super GPT prompt. This prompt includes sections like clearly defined inputs, descriptive context derived from the file, crucial concepts, explicit rules, a step-by-step procedure, and examples—all based on the content of the book itself.\n\nIn a real-world application, several components would need to work together:\n\n1. PDF Parsing & Context Extraction: The system must accurately parse the PDF and extract relevant text, ensuring that the context is correctly identified and segmented.\n\n2. Natural Language Understanding: It would need to understand the task and identify important concepts strictly from the document’s content, similar to how a security expert might analyze technical data in a cyberpunk narrative.\n\n3. Prompt Generation: Based on the extracted information, the system has to generate a coherent and structured prompt that others (or another AI) can use, with clear instructions and all the necessary sections.\n\n4. User Interaction and Customization: The process requires the user to define the goal and subsequently refine or adjust the details of the prompt, ensuring the output aligns with the intended task.\n\nWhile current technologies offer components of this process (like PDF text extraction and large language models that can generate structured content), integrating them into a fully seamless “Book to Prompt” system with high accuracy and context sensitivity is a sophisticated engineering challenge. However, as a concept—especially within a cyberpunk narrative—it’s both imaginative and within the realm of near-future technological advancements.\n\nSo, yes, the idea is realistic as a conceptual tool and could very well be implemented with a well-designed system, even if some of the technical hurdles would need careful handling in a real-world scenario.",

Create a descriptive context that explains how the goal relates to the book’s content.  \n  – Elaborate on important theoretical or conceptual details emerging from the text.  \n5. Formulate explicit rules and procedural steps tailored to the book’s content and the stated goal.  \n6. Provide concrete examples (if available in the book) to illustrate the concepts and application steps.\n\nE. Examples  \n• If the book includes a chapter on “Effective Communication”:  \n  Example:  \n  - Input: PDF of a book including a chapter on “Effective Communication.”  \n  - Goal: Convert the chapter’s strategies into a prompt for a presentation slide deck on communication best practices.  \n  - Processing: Extract key bullet points and underlying theories (such as feedback loops, active listening) and generate a step-by-step guide to creating the slide deck.  \n• This mirrors the file’s emphasis on turning book content into actionable, practical steps.\n\n──────────────────────────────\n3. Theoretical Viewpoints Explored\n\n• Content Theory Perspective:  \n The key concepts pulled from the book's content become building blocks. By emphasizing only material present in the file, the prompt maintains fidelity to the original source and ensures relevance.\n\n• User-Centered Design Perspective:  \n The process is engineered so the user’s goal and input are the primary drivers. Clear instructions, examples, and step-by-step procedures reduce ambiguity and cater to varied user expertise levels.\n\n• Technical Prompt Engineering Perspective:  \n The procedure ensures that the prompt’s structure is modular—each part (input, context, rules, procedure, examples) builds on the previous one, leading to a robust and reusable prompt template optimized for various tasks.\n\n──────────────────────────────\n4. Summary\n\nThe Super GPT prompt design takes two fundamental inputs—a PDF containing a book and a user-specified goal. It proceeds to create an actionable, context-rich prompt by:  \n • Defining the input clearly,  \n • Offering a detailed context rooted in the book’s content,  \n • Imposing rules and constraints that maintain focus on the file’s concepts,  \n • Laying out a sequential procedure to convert theory into action,  \n • And providing examples to illustrate the process.\n\nThis multifaceted approach, viewed through cognitive, instructional, and technical lenses, ensures that the final prompt is both actionable and deeply grounded in the book’s theoretical underpinnings.\n\nFeel free to refine or request additional details based on any specific angle or further requirements!",

Here’s a step-by-step strategic approach for preparing for a **privacy-extinct future** using the Book to Prompt framework, with a focus on how to create an actionable Super GPT prompt once you upload your chosen PDF.\n\n---\n\n## Strategic Planning for a Privacy-Extinct Future: Book to Prompt Preparation\n\n### 1. Clarify Your Goal\nBefore uploading a book, identify the *specific objective* you want to address regarding a privacy-extinct future.  \n**Example goals:**\n- Develop personal or organizational strategies for thriving when privacy is gone.\n- Identify risks and mitigation tactics in a world without privacy.\n- Create ethical guidelines for businesses operating in a privacy-free landscape.\n\n### 2. Select the Right Book\nChoose a book (in PDF) that’s rich in content about privacy, surveillance, technology, or societal adaptation (e.g., \"The Age of Surveillance Capitalism,\" \"Data and Goliath,\" etc.).\n\n### 3. Prepare Your Goal Statement\nWrite a clear, concise statement of what you want the prompt to achieve.  \n**Example:**  \n> \"Extract actionable strategies for individuals to protect their digital autonomy in a future where privacy no longer exists.\"\n\n### 4. Use the Book to Prompt Framework  \nAfter uploading the PDF and stating your goal, expect the following output structure (which you can further customize):\n\n---\n\n### Super GPT Prompt Template (as per Book to Prompt & SuperPrompter GPT)\n\n#### 1. **Clearly Defined Input**\nDefine the specific input the user must provide (e.g., a scenario, a list of concerns, a user profile).\n\n#### 2. **Descriptive Context**\nSummarize the relevant parts of the book:\n- What does the book say about privacy extinction?\n- What are the key challenges and opportunities?\n- How does the book suggest individuals/organizations can adapt?\n\n**Important concepts to highlight:**\n- Surveillance capitalism\n- Behavioral data and profiling\n- Consent and autonomy\n- Social engineering risks\n- Digital self-defense\n\n#### 3. **Rules to Accomplish the Task**\nSet constraints and guidelines, such as:\n- Use only strategies described in the book.\n- No generic advice—ground every suggestion in the author’s arguments.\n\n#### 4. **Step-by-Step Procedure**\nLay out the procedure for the AI (or user) to follow. For example:\n- Step 1: Identify the specific privacy threat described in the input.\n- Step 2: Match this threat to relevant concepts from the book.\n- Step 3: Generate an actionable strategy or mitigation plan.\n- Step 4: Explain the rationale using book excerpts.\n\n#### 5. **Examples**\nIf the book or your goal offers examples, include these as templates.\n\n---\n\n## Example Super GPT Prompt (for a privacy-extinct future)\n\n```\nYou are Privacy Strategist GPT.\n\nGoal: Use the concepts and strategies from [BOOK TITLE] to help users develop actionable plans for living and thriving in a privacy-extinct future.\n\nInput: User provides a scenario or concern about loss of privacy (e.g., \"My employer tracks all my communications. How can I maintain autonomy?\").\n\nContext: [BOOK TITLE] explores the consequences of a world without privacy, detailing how surveillance, data commodification, and loss of autonomy impact individuals and organizations. Key concepts include surveillance capitalism, behavioral profiling, and digital resistance strategies.\n\nRules:\n- All advice must be grounded in the book.\n- No speculative or unsupported claims.\n- Prioritize actionable, practical steps over theory.\n\nProcedure:\n1. Analyze the user's scenario to identify core privacy challenges.\n2. Relate these to concepts and examples from the book.\n3. Suggest practical strategies, tools, or mindsets as detailed in the book.\n4. Justify each suggestion with a brief reference or rationale based on the book.\n\nExample:\nUser Input: \"I want to protect my children from excessive data collection in schools.\"\nResponse: [Draws on book's discussion of institutional surveillance and recommends opt-out mechanisms, digital hygiene education, and advocacy as outlined by the author.]\n```\n\n---\n\n## Key Concepts to Include (if present in the book)\n\n- The inevitability of surveillance in digital society\n- The shift from privacy as a right to privacy as a privilege\n- Psychological, social, and economic impacts of privacy loss\n- Resilience strategies: encryption, data minimalism, behavioral adaptation\n- The role of legislation and collective action\n\n---\n\n**Preparation Tip:**  \nBefore uploading, skim the book for chapters or sections most relevant to your scenario. This will help SuperPrompter GPT focus on the most actionable content.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nBy following the Book to Prompt structure and focusing on privacy-extinct scenarios, you’ll create precise, actionable prompts that leverage the depth of the chosen book—ensuring your planning is grounded, relevant, and effective.\n\n---\n\nIf you upload a specific PDF and share your goal, I can help you craft the exact Super GPT prompt with content tailored to that book!",

For instance:\n\nExample from the file (placeholder—replace with actual content):  \n• “Chapter X: The Company Y Data Breach” – shows how an organization dealt with a major privacy intrusion.  \n• Illustrates how they implemented a new set of security policies and the outcome.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAn illustrative “Super GPT Prompt” (Skeleton):\n\n“YOU ARE [ROLE/TASK GOES HERE].  \nINPUT: Please provide [description of the required user input (e.g., ‘the full text from Chapter 3 on privacy legislation and the summary points mentioned in Chapter 4 about implementing new strategies’)].  \n\nCONTEXT:  \n[Summary of relevant information from the file regarding privacy-extinct future and its implications. Highlight key themes, concepts, solutions, frameworks, or examples described in the text.]\n\nIMPORTANT CONCEPTS:  \n– [List and define key terms/concepts from the file that shape the context.]\n\nRULES:  \n1) [List constraint #1]  \n2) [List constraint #2]  \n...  \n\nSTEP-BY-STEP PROCEDURE:  \n1) [Step #1: e.g., Summarize the privacy-extinct scenario…]  \n2) [Step #2: e.g., Outline proposed solutions…]  \n...  \n\nEXAMPLES (if available):  \n[Provide working examples from the file, demonstrating the steps or illustrating the concepts above.]  \n\nReply in [specify format/structure, e.g., bullet points, short paragraphs, or Q&A style].  \nLimit references strictly to the provided context from the file. Do not fabricate information.”\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nUse this template as a starting point, then inject the actual content from your book/PDF (written by Lucas C. Pimentel) once you have it, ensuring that you only refer to the material explicitly covered in that file. This will help you craft a precise and context-rich “Super GPT Prompt” for developing strategies around a “privacy-extinct future.”",

          "response": "Below is an example of how you can prepare a Super GPT prompt for strategic planning about a future in which privacy is extinct, using the Book-to-Prompt method as described by Lucas C. Pimentel. This template converts the file’s context into a clearly structured actionable prompt. Note that everything below is derived solely from the contents of the file and the instructions provided.\n\n─────────────────────────────\n\nRole for the Prompt: \n• You are SuperPrompter GPT, an expert in translating complex texts into actionable strategies. Your task is to help create a detailed strategic planning prompt that addresses challenges and solutions for a future where privacy is extinct.\n\nGoal/Task for the Prompt:\n• The aim is to develop a detailed, actionable plan concerning how society should prepare for a privacy-extinct future. This includes evaluating potential impacts on social structures, governance, technological measures, ethics, and individual rights.\n\nNow, append to your prompt the following structure:\n\n1. Clearly Defined Input:\n   • Specify that the only input needed is the PDF file containing the detailed analysis or discussion on the privacy-extinct future. The prompt should require the user to upload (or reference) this file.\n   • Example input detail: “Upload the PDF file that outlines the scenarios and challenges of a privacy-extinct future.”\n\n2. Descriptive Context:\n   • Offer a clear, descriptive context by summarizing the key issues raised in the file:\n       - Define “privacy-extinct future” as a scenario where personal privacy is systematically eroded or rendered obsolete due to technological, political, and social forces.\n       - Emphasize crucial related concepts such as surveillance capitalism, data permanence, loss of anonymity, and the potential psychosocial and political ramifications.\n       - Explain that the strategic planning should bridge the theoretical analysis from the file with actionable steps for policy-making, ethical guidelines, and technological safeguards.\n   • Use phrases like “informed by the insights provided in the file…” to ensure the context directly relates to the source material.\n\n3. Rules to Accomplish the Task:\n   • Establish firm guidelines:\n       - Only use information and concepts contained in the uploaded PDF file—avoid introducing external data.\n       - The prompt answer must focus solely on planning, ensuring that solutions are plausible within the scenario described.\n       - Ensure the language is clear, precise, and structured to aid real-world decision making.\n       - Adhere to any procedural constraints specified in the file if mentioned (e.g., step-by-step planning, prioritized challenges).\n\n4. Step-by-Step Procedure to Accomplish the Task:\n   • Detail an ordered series of steps to build the strategic plan:\n       Step 1: Analyze the uploaded PDF to extract all key concepts regarding the loss of privacy.\n       Step 2: Identify and list the major challenges, such as surveillance risks, ethical dilemmas, and potential social upheaval.\n       Step 3: Develop a prioritized list of strategic actions (policy interventions, technological safeguards, legal reforms).\n       Step 4: For each action, detail the rationale, necessary resources, and potential outcomes.\n       Step 5: Ensure each plan step aligns with the context provided from the text in the file.\n       Step 6: Validate that all proposed actions directly respond to the challenges of a privacy-extinct future.\n   • Mention that the result should be an integrated, step-by-step guide for policymakers and stakeholders.\n\n5. Examples:\n   • If available in the file, include examples directly:\n       - For instance, if the file discusses historical events like the inception of mass data collection in the digital age, then mention: “Example: Analyze the evolution of digital surveillance from the 2000s to now as a case study to inform future strategies.”\n       - Or, if there is a sample scenario demonstrated in the file, detail how a specific policy successfully mitigated a privacy risk in a similar context.\n   • Use these examples to illustrate how each step of the procedure plays out in actual strategic planning.\n\n─────────────────────────────\n\nImportant Concepts Highlighted:\n• Privacy-Extinct Future: Explain its meaning and significance.\n• Actionable Strategies: Break down the theoretical analysis into step-by-step policy and planning actions.\n• Constraints & Focus: Emphasize that the strategy is rooted in the content of the file, ensuring that all ideas presented are derived from this source.\n• Clear, Logical Structure: Ensure the prompt is methodically organized so that each part builds from the previous one, making it easier for decision-makers to follow and implement.\n\n─────────────────────────────\n\nWhen you combine these elements, your Super GPT prompt becomes a comprehensive tool for strategic planning about a privacy-extinct future. It walks the user through preparing detailed recommendations, ensuring that ideas remain tied to the provided context and are structured in a step-by-step, actionable format.\n\nThis is the blueprint for your Super GPT prompt derived solely from the file's content and the instructions. Use, adjust, or expand on this structure as needed while respecting the original material.",

          "response": "Certainly! Let’s break down, in a purely theoretical sense, how the system described—## Book to Prompt by Lucas C Pimentel—would work in principle, with respect to the prompt template you’ve provided.\n\n## Theoretical Workflow Overview\n\n### 1. User Uploads a PDF of a Book\n- The system receives and processes the entire book’s text.\n- The content is parsed, indexed, and made searchable/accessible for contextual extraction.\n\n### 2. User States Their Goal\n- The user provides a specific task or outcome they want to achieve, e.g., “Summarize each chapter for a study guide” or “Extract key negotiation strategies.”\n\n### 3. System Generates a Super GPT Prompt\nThe workflow for generating a supercharged, context-aware prompt (using your template) would be:\n\n#### a. Receive the user's role and task/goal.\n- Example: “You are an expert study guide creator. Your task is to create concise chapter summaries.”\n\n#### b. Analyze the Book’s Content\n- The system scans the PDF for relevant sections, definitions, and examples that relate to the user’s goal.\n\n#### c. Construct the Prompt Using the Template\nThe system fills in each part of your template as follows:\n\n**Input:**\n- Defines exactly what the user is expected to provide (e.g., “Please specify the chapter number or topic”).\n\n**Descriptive Context:**\n- Pulls a relevant and concise description from the book about the goal/task.\n- Highlights crucial concepts, terminologies, or themes from the book that are directly related to the asked task.\n\n**Rules:**\n- Lists any constraints or guidelines present in the book, or inferred from the nature of the task (e.g., “Summaries must not exceed 200 words,” or “Use only methods described in chapter 3”).\n\n**Step-by-Step Procedure:**\n- Outlines, sequentially, how to accomplish the task, based on instructions, frameworks, or methodologies found in the book.\n\n**Examples:**\n- Extracts sample tasks, case studies, or demonstrations from the book and formats them as clear examples to illustrate the process or expected output.\n\n### 4. Ensuring Relevance and Accuracy\n- The system strictly limits its context, explanations, and rules to what is actually found in the book PDF, avoiding hallucination or overgeneralization.\n\n### 5. Output: Turnkey Prompt\n- The final output is a detailed, context-rich prompt that leverages both the user’s goal and the book’s content, ready to be used for further AI tasking.\n\n---\n\n## Summary: Why This Works\n\n- **Contextual Accuracy:** By grounding every part of the prompt in the actual book, the output is highly relevant and actionable.\n- **Task Customization:** The user’s stated goal steers the extraction, so the prompt is tailored for their needs.\n- **Structured Guidance:** The template enforces clarity, completeness, and stepwise instructions, making the prompt robust and easy for any AI to follow.\n\n---\n\n## Example (Theoretical)\n\nSuppose the book is about “Effective Time Management,” and the user wants a prompt for weekly planning tips.\n\n**Prompt might be generated as:**\n\n---\n\n**Role & Task:**  \nYou are a time management coach. Your task is to provide weekly planning tips based strictly on the methods outlined in the book “Effective Time Management.”\n\n**Input:**  \nSpecify the target audience (e.g., students, professionals).\n\n**Descriptive Context:**  \nThis book focuses on the Eisenhower Matrix, prioritization techniques, and habit formation for maximizing weekly productivity.\n\n**Crucial Concepts:**  \n- Eisenhower Matrix: Urgent vs. Important tasks  \n- Weekly Review: Assessing past week’s accomplishments  \n- Habit Stacking: Building new routines incrementally\n\n**Rules:**  \n- Only use techniques specifically described in the book.  \n- Tips must be actionable and limited to 3–5 steps per week.\n\n**Step-by-Step Procedure:**  \n1. Identify the week’s primary goals using the Eisenhower Matrix.  \n2. Schedule time blocks for each goal.  \n3. Review and adjust plan at week’s end.\n\n**Examples:**  \n- For professionals: “Block 2 hours on Monday for project planning (see Ch. 3).”  \n- For students: “Use the Eisenhower Matrix (p. 45) on Sunday evening.”\n\n---\n\n**In summary:**  \nThe system works by turning the book’s content into actionable, contextually accurate prompts, using a structured template, based on user goals.\n\n**Let me know if you’d like a breakdown of any specific technical step, or a simulated end-to-end example!**",

          "response": "Below is a purely theoretical outline of how one might implement the “Book to Prompt” idea—turning a book (in PDF form) into actionable prompts—based on the high-level description you provided, without any additional text from an unspecified file.\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n1. INPUT: UPLOADING THE BOOK\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n• Format: The user provides the PDF of the book.  \n• Assumption: The PDF contains text that can be programmatically extracted.\n\nKey steps in principle:\na. Text Extraction: Convert the PDF into machine-readable text, preserving structure if possible (headings, chapters).  \nb. Text Cleaning and Segmentation: Remove extraneous formatting (e.g., repeated headers/footers). Split the text into manageable chunks or sections (e.g., chapters, sections, or paragraphs).\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n2. DEFINING THE USER GOAL\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n• The user states a specific goal or use case: for instance, “I want to create a study guide,” or “I want to brainstorm new campaign ideas based on this marketing book.” \n\nWhy it matters:\na. Contextual Direction: The user’s goal guides what aspects of the text are most relevant for final prompts.  \nb. Goal-Driven Summarization: Instead of summarizing the entire text, the system focuses on building prompts that relate to the user’s specific aim.\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n3. CREATING THE PROMPT STRUCTURE\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nBelow is a theoretical outline of how “SuperPrompter GPT” (the system described in your snippet) could structure its final prompt output:\n\na. Role/Task Definition:  \n   • Role: “You are a specialized assistant” (or any other role relevant to the user’s stated goal).  \n   • Task/Goal: “Solve problem X” or “Generate a plan for Y,” with reference to the content of the book.\n\nb. Input Specification:  \n   • The system clearly defines what input it expects from the user in the future. For example, “Provide me with a chapter or topic from the book to explore further” or “Share the target audience details for your marketing plan.”\n\nc. Descriptive Context:  \n   • The system draws on key concepts, highlights, and insights from the book that are strictly relevant to the user’s task. This could be a concise summary or bullet points of main ideas. For example, if the book is on productivity, the context might emphasize the book’s top methods or principles for time management.\n\nd. Rules:  \n   • The prompt may specify constraints or guidelines, such as “Only use examples from the book’s chapters on project planning,” or “Follow the author’s recommended structure for evaluating new ideas.”\n\ne. Step-by-Step Procedure:  \n   • The prompt could outline a procedure for how to approach the task. For instance, “1) Identify relevant quotes, 2) Summarize them, 3) Generate a hypothesis or solution, 4) Compare with the book’s suggestions.”\n\nf. Examples:  \n   • If the system has access to relevant examples from the source text (e.g., case studies or sample scenarios mentioned in the book), it includes brief examples illustrating how to apply key concepts.\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n4. PROCESS AND METHODOLOGY\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nTheoretically, here is how the system could convert a large body of text (the entire book) into a something that supports generating final prompts:\n\na. Text Analysis Pipeline:  \n   1) Summarization and Thematic Identification: Use automated methods (e.g., large language models) to identify the main themes, important definitions, and crucial arguments from each section of the book.  \n   2) Relevance Filtering: Discard or lower the priority of sections not related to the user’s goal. The system might do this by comparing the user’s question/goal to the text’s thematic map.  \n   3) Extracting Key Quotes or Props: Identify specific quotations, important sections, or data that could be directly used to guide the user’s prompt.  \n\nb. Prompt Assembly:  \n   1) Role Definition: Insert the role statement (“You are …”).  \n   2) Goal/Task Statement: Insert the user’s goal in a succinct form.  \n   3) Contextual Insights: Insert relevant insights drawn from the analysis pipeline (e.g., “According to Chapter 3, the author emphasizes X for Y reason”).  \n   4) Constraints/Rules: Add any user or book-based constraints.  \n   5) Procedure: Outline a method or workflow consistent with the user’s problem-solving approach.  \n\nc. Refinement & Output:  \n   • The system revises or reorders these pieces to ensure the final prompt is clear, logically structured, and directly helpful for the user’s next step (e.g., brainstorming solutions, writing a summary, or creating a plan).\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n5. THEORETICAL OUTCOME\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nIf executed successfully, the user ends up with a ready-to-use “super prompt”:\n• It references exactly the content of the book that matters to their goal.  \n• It lays out instructions, rules, and examples so that when the user (or another model) reads and processes this prompt, they can produce results informed by the book’s key insights and the user’s objective.  \n\n“Book to Prompt” in this theoretical implementation thus bridges the gap between large, unstructured text (the book) and a purpose-built prompt that guides a conversation or a creative ideation session—without forcing the user to manually comb through the entire book for relevant details.\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nSUMMARY\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nIn summary, from a purely conceptual standpoint:  \n1) The user uploads a PDF and states a specific goal.  \n2) The system extracts and processes the text, identifying critical points.  \n3) The system generates a special prompt (e.g., “SuperPrompter GPT” style) that includes the role, task, input type, context, rules, steps to follow, and examples—based solely on the relevant sections of the book.  \n\nThis theoretically allows any book’s content to be packaged into an actionable, context-rich prompt that directly supports the user’s stated objective.",

          "response": "Let's break down how the described approach would work in theory:\n\n1. Role Assignment and Task Definition  \n   • The system first reassigns its role (e.g., “You are SuperPrompter GPT”) so that the AI knows exactly what its purpose is.  \n   • The user then provides a clear task or goal related to a prompt they want to construct. This sets the objective for the entire exercise.\n\n2. Using a File as Context  \n   • The process assumes that a PDF file (a book) is uploaded, which contains valuable information.  \n   • The content of this file serves as the primary source of context and informs what the final prompt should capture.  \n   • Only the information within the file is to be used, ensuring that the resulting prompt is tethered to the text provided.\n\n3. Building the Prompt in Structured Sections  \n   The system then enhances the prompt with several structured sections derived from the file:\n\n   a. Clearly Defined Input  \n      • A section specifies exactly what kind of input is required from the user.  \n      • For example, it might require text excerpts, specific sections, or particular examples from the book.\n\n   b. Descriptive Context  \n      • Based directly on the content of the file, this section summarizes the main goal or task.  \n      • It highlights central concepts and elaborates on them to ensure the generated prompt is relevant and comprehensive.  \n      • This description ensures that every aspect of the prompt is grounded in the material the user has provided.\n\n   c. Rules to Accomplish the Task  \n      • Here, any constraints, limitations, or special guidelines derived from the file are enumerated.  \n      • For example, “only use information present in the file,” which ensures fidelity to the source material.\n    \n   d. Step-by-Step Procedure  \n      • The process outlines a clear, logical series of steps that one should follow to accomplish the task.  \n      • Each step builds on the previous one so that the final prompt is well-ordered and actionable.\n\n   e. Examples (if present in the file)  \n      • If the uploaded book contains relevant examples, these are integrated into the final prompt.  \n      • Examples provide concrete clarity and help illustrate how the prompt should function.\n\n4. Theoretical Workflow Overview  \n   • The user begins by assigning the role and specifying the task.  \n   • The system then accesses the uploaded file and extracts necessary details.  \n   • Using the extracted data, the system adds information under each of the structured sections (input, context, rules, procedures, examples).  \n   • Finally, the output is a “Super GPT prompt” that is actionable, detailed, and pinpoints exactly how to achieve the defined goal while adhering to the content of the book.\n\n5. Importance of Adhering to the File Content  \n   • A key component is that every piece of additional context, every rule, and every example is strictly derived from the file contents provided.  \n   • This ensures that the prompt is not only aligned with the user’s goal but is also tightly integrated with the original source material, making it both actionable and contextually relevant.\n\nIn summary, in a purely theoretical sense, the method works by leveraging a structured framework that extracts and organizes relevant data from a book (or PDF file). It then uses that data to build an elaborate, actionable prompt—one that contains clearly defined input guidelines, descriptive context, operational rules, a step-by-step approach, and examples—all of which directly refer to the source material. This ensures that the final prompt is both highly specific and firmly based on the content of the provided file.",

          "response": "In a purely theoretical sense, here's how the \"Book to Prompt\" approach would work in principle:\n\n### Core Principle:\nThe \"Book to Prompt\" approach is based upon converting complex and lengthy textual information from a book into concise, actionable, and clearly structured prompts. The goal is to maximize the practical usefulness of the knowledge contained within the book by synthesizing, structuring, and reformatting it into carefully crafted prompts for GPT models (or similar AI systems).\n\n### Step-by-step theoretical workflow:\n\n1. **File Upload (Book)**  \n   The user provides a PDF or similar digital file containing the complete text of a chosen book.\n\n2. **User-defined Goal/Task**  \n   The user explicitly states their desired outcome: the type of actionable prompt they wish to generate.  \n   - Example:  \n     - \"Summarize the key learning points from each chapter\"  \n     - \"Create actionable prompts for implementing the methods outlined in the book\"  \n     - \"Extract practical exercises and transform them into structured prompts\"\n\n3. **File analysis and context extraction**  \n   The system (or \"SuperPrompter GPT\") theoretically would:\n   - Read the uploaded file thoroughly.\n   - Analyze and identify key themes, concepts, ideas, examples, techniques, and actionable insights relevant to the user's stated goal.\n   - Identify and highlight important concepts and contextual information critical for the prompt.\n\n4. **Generation of a structured prompt**  \n   Based on the file's content and the user's goal, the system creates a clearly structured prompt containing:\n   \n   - **Clearly defined input**:  \n     Define precisely what information, data, or context is required from the user or from future interactions to effectively use the prompt.\n   \n   - **Descriptive context**:  \n     Provide a concise description of the goal or task, derived directly from the uploaded file, clearly stating the relevance of the extracted material. Important concepts are highlighted and explained to improve context understanding.\n   \n   - **Rules and constraints**:  \n     Enumerate clear guidelines, constraints, or limitations based on the book’s content to ensure the task is performed accurately and consistently.\n   \n   - **Step-by-step procedure**:  \n     Provide a logical, sequential set of steps derived from the book content to guide users or AI through the task clearly and effectively.\n   \n   - **Examples**:  \n     Give concrete examples (if present in the file) drawn from the book to illustrate how the prompt would be practically implemented or how results should look.\n\n### Example (theoretical illustration):\n\n- **Uploaded File**: A book about productivity methods.\n- **User Goal**: \"Turn productivity principles into actionable daily task prompts.\"\n\nThe system would theoretically:\n- Analyze the book content.\n- Identify and clearly explain important productivity concepts, such as \"time blocking,\" \"Pomodoro technique,\" \"prioritization,\" and \"task batching.\"\n- Define the precise input needed (e.g., daily tasks, goals, or available hours).\n- Clearly describe the task (creating daily task prompts based on productivity principles).\n- Specify rules and constraints (e.g., recommended session length, prioritization criteria from the book).\n- Provide a step-by-step procedure to generate prompts (e.g., first gather tasks, then prioritize tasks, then assign tasks to time blocks).\n- Provide examples based on the book's actual content, such as \"Prompt Example: 'Given today's tasks, use the Pomodoro technique from Chapter 3 to structure your workflow.'\"\n\n### Why It Works (Theoretical Rationale):\n- The approach leverages the structured, analytical abilities of GPT models to systematically break down complex textual information into clear, actionable prompts.\n- By explicitly defining inputs, contexts, rules, procedures, and examples, it reduces ambiguity and enhances the accuracy and usability of the generated prompts.\n- Highlighting and explaining critical concepts directly from the book improves the effectiveness of the final prompts.\n\nIn essence, the \"Book to Prompt\" method theoretically transforms books into highly structured and actionable knowledge tools through a systematic and deliberate process of extraction, summarization, and prompt creation.",

          "response": "When working through the Book to Prompt process and creating a “Super GPT prompt,” you’ll notice several recurring patterns or structural elements presented in the instructions. These patterns help guide how to transform the contents of a book or PDF into a well-structured prompt. Specifically, look for:\n\n1) Roles and Goals:  \n   • How the instructions emphasize defining a clear “role” (e.g., “You are SuperPrompter GPT”) and stating the “task/goal” that the prompt is designed to achieve.  \n   • The role indicates the perspective or function the AI should assume; the goal ensures everyone knows the main purpose or outcome you want.\n\n2) Defined Input:  \n   • A repeated pattern is an explicit statement of what type of input you need from the user (e.g., “Upload the PDF of a book” or “Provide your goal as a user”).  \n   • Notice how the instructions clarify the input’s format (like a file, a brief text, or a set of questions).\n\n3) Descriptive Context:  \n   • The process consistently calls for adding context from the book or file to enrich the prompt. This context includes foundational concepts, important definitions, or relevant background details directly drawn from the source material.  \n   • Pay attention to how the instructions encourage focusing only on information contained in the file to keep the prompt both accurate and on-topic.\n\n4) Crucial Concepts:  \n   • The instructions often emphasize picking out “crucial” or “key” concepts related to the user’s stated goal.  \n   • Look for language prompting you to highlight, define, or explain these concepts more thoroughly because they will help produce better, more relevant prompts.\n\n5) Rules to Accomplish the Task:  \n   • A distinct pattern is the mention of “rules,” “constraints,” or “guidelines” that must be followed.  \n   • This might include how to handle certain types of data, constraints on the format of the output, or procedural requirements specific to the book’s content.\n\n6) Step-by-Step Procedure:  \n   • The instructions repeatedly lay out tasks in a linear, methodical way. Each step clearly follows from the previous one, ensuring the final prompt is comprehensive.  \n   • Look for words like “enumerate,” “sequence,” or “procedure,” which signal the importance of orderly instructions.\n\n7) Examples:  \n   • Another pattern: including or referring to examples that demonstrate how to apply the above steps.  \n   • The instructions might say “If the file has them, provide clear examples,” guiding you to locate any practical illustrations or sample prompts.\n\nOverall, watch for these structural themes—role/goals, clearly defined input, context, key concepts, rules, procedures, and examples. They appear throughout the Book to Prompt method and will help you extract and arrange details from any book (or PDF) into an actionable, high-quality prompt.",

          "response": "When reviewing case studies that convert a book into actionable prompts, you can look for recurring patterns in how the prompt is structured and the details that are emphasized. Here are some key patterns to watch for:\n\n1. Role and Task Definition\n   • The prompt starts with a clear statement of the role (in your case, \"SuperPrompter GPT\") and the overall task or goal.\n   • This sets the tone and ensures that every following instruction is aligned with the intended purpose.\n\n2. Clearly Defined Input\n   • Look for segments that specify exactly what type of input is needed (for example, a PDF file, text excerpts, or any other form of content).\n   • This ensures the prompt is precise about what data it will process.\n\n3. Descriptive Context\n   • There is an emphasis on providing background information or context derived from the file.\n   • Important concepts relevant to the goal are explained in this section, ensuring that the prompt reflects the content’s depth and purpose.\n   • The context helps clarify the objective behind turning the book's content into actionable prompts.\n\n4. Identification of Crucial Concepts\n   • Notice patterns where the essential topics and concepts embedded in the book or case study are highlighted.\n   • These concepts are often explained to provide better grounding and relevance in the resulting prompt.\n   • This part is important to maintain focus on the most important aspects of the content.\n\n5. Rules to Accomplish the Task\n   • The pattern includes an enumeration of specific guidelines and constraints.\n   • These rules act as boundaries, ensuring that the generated prompt stays within the defined parameters.\n   • It may include directives about what must or must not be included in the prompt.\n\n6. Step-by-Step Procedure\n   • The instructions are broken down into sequential steps that should be followed logically.\n   • This pattern provides clarity in execution, making it easier to understand how the input turns into a final actionable prompt.\n   • It typically outlines how to process the input, integrate the context, apply the rules, and ultimately generate the prompt.\n\n7. Use of Examples\n   • If available, clear examples are provided to illustrate exactly how the transformation from book content to a prompt should occur.\n   • These examples are crucial for understanding the application of each of the previous sections (input, context, rules, and steps).\n\nBy looking for these patterns—role/task definition, clear input specifications, enriched context with critical concepts, a set of rules, a step-by-step process, and illustrative examples—you can systematically analyze and create prompts that are precise, actionable, and aligned with the content of the book. These repeatable structures ensure consistency and clarity across different case studies, making your analyses robust and your resultant prompts effective.",

          "response": "Below is one possible approach for creating a “super GPT prompt” based on the content of the “Book to Prompt” file and the instructions provided:\n\n1. Identify the Role and Task/Goal:\n   • In your scenario, the role is \"SuperPrompter GPT.\"  \n   • The task/goal is to transform the text of a book (in PDF form) into actionable prompts directed at a specific objective the user provides (e.g., “I want to write a summary,” “I want to develop a lesson plan,” etc.).\n\n2. Clearly Define the Input:\n   • According to “Book to Prompt,” the main type of input is:\n     1) The PDF file of the book.  \n     2) The explicit goal or objective you want to accomplish (e.g., a summary for a presentation, a lesson plan, insights for research).  \n   • Specify any important format details (e.g., the PDF file’s text must be extracted in a machine-readable form).\n\n3. Gather Descriptive Context:\n   • Provide a concise summary of the “Book to Prompt” approach:  \n     – Step 1: Upload a PDF to parse the text.  \n     – Step 2: Supply a specific goal or task so the system can produce targeted prompts.  \n   • Emphasize how the system will tailor its output to the desired objective.  \n   • Highlight how the approach automates prompt creation from large text files.\n\n4. Rules to Accomplish the Task:\n   • Only use text from the uploaded PDF as the source of information (per the “Book to Prompt” principle).  \n   • Keep the prompts goal-focused and relevant; do not include unrelated details.  \n   • Maintain clarity and consistency: each prompt should align with the stated objective.\n\n5. Step-by-Step Procedure:\n   1) Obtain the PDF file of the book.  \n   2) Extract the text and structure it (chapters, sections, headings).  \n   3) Review the user’s stated goal or objective for how the text will be used.  \n   4) Identify key concepts from the book that relate to the user’s goal.  \n   5) Outline the preliminary prompts or structured questions focusing on those key concepts.  \n   6) Refine the prompts by adding context and examples, ensuring each prompt directly supports the user’s goal.  \n   7) Present a final set of prompts or instructions tailored to the objective.\n\n6. Examples (Hypothetical, Based on Approach):\n   • If the user’s goal is to “create a lesson plan from Chapter 3 of a textbook”:  \n     – Prompt Example: “Using the main points and learning objectives extracted from Chapter 3, create a 45-minute lesson plan that includes an introduction, interactive activities, and a mini-assessment.”  \n   • If the user’s goal is to “write a concise overview of the core arguments in a research chapter”:  \n     – Prompt Example: “From the PDF, summarize the three main arguments made by the author and provide an example that illustrates each.”\n\nBy following these steps—defining the input, providing context, spelling out rules, showing a clear procedure, and offering relevant sample prompts—you can construct a robust “Super GPT prompt” that harnesses the “Book to Prompt” methodology while remaining tightly focused on the content given in the uploaded PDF.",

Define the Role and Task  \n • Start by clearly stating the role (SuperPrompter GPT) and describe that its job is to convert information from the uploaded PDF into a well-crafted prompt.  \n • Specify what the overall goal is (e.g., turning the book contents into a set of actionable instructions).\n\n2. Determine the Input  \n • Clearly describe what input the user must provide. For example, the system expects:\n  – A PDF file (the book)  \n  – A specific goal or task that the book’s content should address  \n This makes it explicit what data the system will work with.\n\n3. Provide Descriptive Context  \n • Summarize the relevant topics, key themes, or concepts from the PDF.  \n • Elaborate on how these elements relate to the requested goal. The context might include details about the book’s subject matter and how it informs the user’s objective.\n • Explain important concepts from the file that are crucial for understanding the task, ensuring that the prompt remains closely tied to the source material.\n\n4. Enumerate Rules to Accomplish the Task  \n • List any critical guidelines, constraints, or procedural instructions that must be followed.  \n • For example, if the PDF contains specific terminology or methodologies, note that the prompt should adhere to these elements without deviation.\n • Make it clear that the task should only refer to content found in the PDF file.\n\n5. Lay Out a Step-by-Step Procedure  \n • Break down the task into ordered steps. For instance:\n  1. Read the PDF and extract key concepts.\n  2. Identify the user’s specific goal.\n  3. Match the user’s goal with the relevant parts of the book.\n  4. Craft a detailed prompt that includes actionable steps, reflective of the content.\n • Ensure that each step builds logically on the previous one, aiding clarity and usability.\n\n6. Include Examples (if available)  \n • Offer one or more examples drawn from the PDF’s content to illustrate how the prompt might work in practice.  \n • For instance, if the book has sample cases or illustrative content, show how those parts can be converted into actionable instructions.\n\nBy following these steps, you ensure that the resulting Super GPT prompt is not only generated from accurate and specific content, but also is actionable, easy to follow, and directly relevant to the user’s goal. This approach maintains focus on the file’s key elements and turns them into a prompt that is rich in context, methodical, and practical.",

Define Your Objective Clearly:\n- First, specify your intended role clearly: What is the role you want the GPT prompt to assume (e.g., a summarized explainer, creative assistant, strategy advisor)?\n- Clearly articulate the task or goal you have from the book. For example, \"Extract actionable insights from marketing theories described in Chapter 4\" or \"Create practical applications from time management strategies mentioned in the book.\"\n\n### 2. Upload and Analyze the Book PDF:\n- Upload the PDF of the chosen book for analysis.\n- Allow the GPT model to extract and summarize key concepts, core ideas, methods, and steps from the text.\n- Identify and highlight critical sections or chapters directly relevant to your stated goal.\n\n### 3. Clearly Defined Input:\n- Determine precisely the type of input required. This could include:\n  - Specific chapters or sections you want analyzed.\n  - Particular concepts, theories, techniques, or frameworks from the book.\n  - Indications of the format or style of the expected output (e.g., bullet points, summaries, examples, action steps).\n\n### 4. Descriptive Context:\n- Establish a clear and descriptive context by extracting the primary goal/task from the uploaded material.\n- Highlight and elaborate crucial concepts from the book closely related to your stated goal, to provide deeper insight and improve the relevance of the prompt. \n  - Clearly explain each important concept.\n  - Clarify how each concept relates directly to the goal/task you have mentioned.\n\n### 5. Rules to Accomplish the Task:\n- Clearly define the rules that must govern the task, such as:\n  - Constraints on what parts of the book the prompt should reference.\n  - Limitations on the length or complexity of output.\n  - Guidelines for formatting or structuring output.\n\n### 6. Step-by-step Procedure to Accomplish the Task:\n- Outline a clear, ordered sequence of steps the GPT model should follow to accomplish the task:\n  1. Identify and summarize the relevant book sections.\n  2. Break down complex ideas into simpler, actionable components.\n  3. Provide actionable prompts or examples directly derived from the book's content.\n  4. Clearly state how the extracted knowledge can be applied practically.\n\n### 7. Provide Examples (If Available):\n- If the book contains illustrative examples, clearly summarize and integrate them into the prompt.\n- Use these examples to help the GPT model better understand the nature, depth, and style of actionable prompts it needs to generate.\n\n### 8. Iterative Validation and Refinement:\n- Validate the initial output against your stated goals. If the initial prompt doesn't fully meet your expectations:\n  - Clearly identify areas needing improvement.\n  - Adjust your instructions or context accordingly.\n  - Repeat the process until you achieve the desired clarity and precision.\n\n### Key Considerations to Ensure Validity:\n- Always remain faithful to the book’s original content; avoid introducing concepts not explicitly found within the provided material.\n- Clearly define the limitations and scope of the task, so the model doesn’t stray from the intended objective.\n- Carefully structure the prompt creation process to ensure the generated results stay practical, relevant, and actionable.\n\nFollowing this structured, clearly defined, and iterative approach will help you design an empirical study that ensures relevance, clarity, and actionable results.",

          "response": "Below is a suggested learning progression that can help students understand and apply the “Book to Prompt” approach. It starts with foundational concepts and gradually moves toward practical application:\n\n1. Introduction to “Book to Prompt”  \n   a) Define the core idea: Discuss how any book (in PDF format) can be transformed into actionable prompts.  \n   b) Explain benefits: Emphasize how students can use prompts to extract insights, practice skills, or achieve specific goals through interactive queries.  \n\n2. Understanding the Role and Goal in Prompt Creation  \n   a) Explore the “SuperPrompter GPT” concept: Show how the AI can adopt a particular role (e.g., “teacher,” “analyst,” or “mentor”) and work toward a specified goal (e.g., “summarize the book,” “provide exercises,” “offer writing prompts”).  \n   b) Clarify user’s goal: Instruct students on how to precisely articulate their purpose for the prompt to get the most relevant output (e.g., “I want to become better at creative writing,” “I need help studying for an exam,” etc.).  \n\n3. Structuring the Prompt  \n   a) Input specification: Teach students to define the type of input needed (e.g., “Upload PDF,” “Provide chapter references,” “Enter a reading excerpt”).  \n   b) Descriptive context: Show how to add the relevant context from the file (e.g., key ideas, themes, definitions) to guide the AI toward the right focus.  \n\n4. Highlighting and Explaining Key Concepts  \n   a) Identifying crucial details from the book: Encourage students to isolate summaries, main concepts, and important quotes to use in prompts.  \n   b) Linking details to goals: Demonstrate how to match crucial information from the text to the student’s goal or question.  \n\n5. Rules and Constraints  \n   a) Importance of constraints: Explain how clarifying rules and boundaries ensures accurate and concise outputs (e.g., “Answer must be 200 words,” “Use only the data from Chapter 2,” “Focus on problem-solving steps”).  \n   b) Procedural guidelines: Show how layering rules (like citation format, writing style, or question format) can refine the AI’s responses.  \n\n6. Step-by-Step Prompt-Building Procedure  \n   a) Step 1 – Upload the PDF: Illustrate how to share or reference the file.  \n   b) Step 2 – State your goal: Provide a clear, specific statement of what the student wants to achieve.  \n   c) Step 3 – Extract relevant sections: Instruct students to highlight the sections or topics of the PDF that align with their goal.  \n   d) Step 4 – Formulate the prompt: Combine the input specification, context, rules, and procedure into one coherent request for the AI.  \n   e) Step 5 – Evaluate and refine: Show students how to review the AI’s response, check for accuracy, and iterate the prompt if necessary.  \n\n7. Examples and Practice  \n   a) Sample prompts: If the book and instructions contain examples, walk through how they were created, reviewed, and improved.  \n   b) Student practice: Assign students tasks where they must create their own prompts based on a short PDF excerpt to reinforce learning.  \n   c) Peer feedback: Encourage students to share prompts with classmates to get feedback and refine their approach.  \n\n8. Reflection and Next Steps  \n   a) Reflect on progress: Have students discuss what they learned about turning book passages into prompts and how it can improve their study or creative process.  \n   b) Explore advanced features: For those who grasp the basics, introduce refining methods, such as using specialized rules for formatting, advanced query structures, or combining multiple prompts for more complex tasks.  \n\nThis progression guides students from a basic understanding of how to convert a book’s content into an actionable prompt, through structuring that prompt with context, rules, and procedures, and onward to iterative practice. By following these steps, students will gain both the conceptual knowledge of why prompts are useful and the practical skills to create them effectively.",

          "response": "Here’s an example of a learning progression that builds a deep understanding of turning a book’s content into an actionable prompt through the process outlined by the “Book to Prompt” method:\n\n1. Foundational Understanding  \n   • Introduce the Concept: Begin with an overview of why and how any book (or its content) can be transformed into actionable prompts. Explain the goal of transforming static text (a book) into a dynamic interaction with an AI.  \n   • Familiarize with Key Terminology: Ensure students are comfortable with terms such as “role,” “task/goal,” “input,” “descriptive context,” “rules,” “step-by-step procedure,” and “examples.”  \n\n2. Analyzing the Provided Instruction Structure  \n   • Role and Task Definition: Have students read and discuss the initial instruction (\"You are SuperPrompter GPT…\") to understand what the role assignment means.  \n   • Dissect the Component Requirements:  \n  - Clearly Defined Input: Identify what type of input is expected (such as text excerpts, key ideas, etc.).  \n  - Descriptive Context: Discuss how to derive context from the file (i.e., understanding the overarching goal/task) and why it’s important to include detailed background information.  \n  - Rules: Investigate constraints and procedural guidelines mentioned; ask students why explicit limitations and structured guidance are crucial in prompt design.  \n  - Step-by-Step Procedure: Outline the importance of an ordered, logical procedure that helps the AI follow the intended process.  \n  - Examples: If any samples exist in the text, have students compare them with the instructions and discern what makes a good example.  \n\n3. Applied Interaction with the File Content  \n   • Guided Practice: Provide students with a sample PDF or excerpt of text. Ask them to extract key points and map them onto the components of the prompt structure (input, context, rules, procedure, examples).  \n   • Role Play: Have students assume the “SuperPrompter GPT” role and work in pairs or groups to practice appending these components to an initial user-provided task or goal.  \n\n4. Scaffolded Prompt Creation  \n   • Step-by-Step Prompt Building:  \n  1. Start with the given role/task and then have students add each required component one at a time (first input, then context, etc.).  \n  2. After each addition, request peer feedback focusing on clarity and alignment with the file’s instructions.  \n   • Emphasize Precision: Remind students to highlight and explain only concepts present in the file and avoid adding external, unrelated details.  \n\n5. Iteration and Refinement  \n   • Editing Process: Encourage multiple drafts where students refine the wording, improve the clarity of concepts, and ensure that the procedures are well defined and easy to follow.  \n   • Real-World Simulation: Use case scenarios where the recreated prompt is applied to meet a specific goal. Reflect on whether the resulting prompt provides the intended guidance when \"SuperPrompter GPT\" generates its response.  \n\n6. Assessment and Reflection  \n   • Self-Assessment and Peer Review: Have students assess their own prompts using a checklist derived from the five major components.  \n   • Discuss Critiques: Organize sessions where students discuss what worked well in their prompt creation and what could be more precisely defined or structured.  \n   • Reflect on Improvement: Ask students to record how clarity in context, clear rules, detailed procedures, and examples can directly improve the performance of an AI prompt.  \n\nThis progression guides students from a basic understanding of the key concepts to practical application and iterative refinement. It promotes critical thinking in deconstructing and reassembling information from a source (the file) into a structured, effective prompt tailored to a specific goal.",

The key concepts involved are:\n\n1. Prompt Engineering: The ability to take source material like a book and distill it into clear, actionable prompts that guide users towards specific learning objectives.\n\n2. Pedagogical Relevance: The prompts generated should be directly relevant to the educational goals and learning outcomes the user wishes to achieve by using the book content.\n\n3. Adaptability: The system should be flexible enough to work with a wide variety of book genres and content, allowing users to create prompts from fiction, non-fiction, textbooks, and other types of literature.\n\nRules:\n1. The input must be a valid PDF file of a book.\n2. The user must specify their learning goals or objectives for transforming the book content.\n3. The generated prompts must be directly relevant to the user's stated goals and the book's content.\n4. The prompts should include a mix of comprehension, analysis, and application-level questions/tasks.\n5. The prompts should adhere to best practices for effective prompt design, such as clear wording, specific instructions, and appropriate length.\n\nStep-by-Step Procedure:\n1. Accept the user's PDF book file and their learning goals/objectives.\n2. Analyze the book's content, structure, and key themes/concepts.\n3. Identify relevant sections, chapters, or passages that align with the user's learning goals.\n4. Craft prompts for each identified section that guide the user towards achieving the stated objectives. These prompts should include:\n   - Comprehension questions to test understanding of the material\n   - Analysis tasks that require deeper engagement with the content\n   - Application exercises that challenge the user to use the knowledge in new contexts\n5. Organize the prompts in a logical sequence that follows the structure of the book.\n6. Provide the user with the complete set of prompts, along with any necessary instructions or explanations.\n\nExamples:\nFor a book on the history of the American Civil War, possible prompts could include:\n- Comprehension: Describe the key events that led to the outbreak of the Civil War.\n- Analysis: Compare and contrast the economic and social motivations of the North and South leading up to the conflict.\n- Application: Imagine you are a soldier fighting for the Union. Write a letter home describing your experiences and perspectives on the war.",

          "response": "Great question! If you're exploring the philosophical implications of the Book to Prompt process (as described in the tool and its methodology), here are some key considerations and questions to reflect on:\n\n## 1. Agency and Interpretation\n- **Whose agency is at play?** When a book is converted into prompts by an AI (or a method), authorship shifts from the original author to the system/user.  \n- **Interpretation:** The process inevitably involves interpretation—what does it mean to \"extract\" actionable prompts from prose or theory? What gets lost, gained, or transformed?  \n- **Intent vs. Use:** Philosophically, is the prompt faithful to the author's intent, or is it creating a new work/intent?\n\n## 2. Knowledge Representation\n- **Reductionism:** Turning a book (complex, nuanced, ambiguous) into prompts (actionable, concise, directive) is a form of reduction. What philosophical issues arise from compressing knowledge this way?  \n- **Context Loss:** Can a prompt capture the depth of context, subtext, and ambiguity present in a book? What are the epistemological risks?\n\n## 3. Hermeneutics and Meaning\n- **Hermeneutic Circle:** Understanding a text always involves a back-and-forth between parts and whole. How does prompt extraction affect this process?  \n- **Meaning Construction:** Is the prompt a neutral extraction or an act of meaning-making in itself?\n\n## 4. Ethics and Authorship\n- **Intellectual Property:** Philosophically (and ethically), who owns the resulting prompt?  \n- **Attribution:** How important is it to maintain attribution to the original author or context?\n\n## 5. Practical Epistemology\n- **Utility vs. Truth:** Prompts are designed for utility—they're actionable. But does this utility sacrifice deeper truths or reflective understanding?  \n- **Fragmentation of Knowledge:** Does this process encourage a fragmented, task-oriented view of knowledge, as opposed to holistic or systemic understanding?\n\n## 6. Human-AI Collaboration\n- **Co-Creation:** Philosophically, what does it mean for a human to co-create with an AI in this way?  \n- **Curation vs. Creation:** Is the user curating, creating, or both? What does this say about creativity and knowledge work in the age of AI?\n\n## 7. Limits of Automation\n- **Tacit Knowledge:** Some book knowledge is tacit, experiential, or ineffable. Can it be captured in prompts?  \n- **Limits of Formalization:** What can't be turned into a prompt, and why?\n\n---\n\n### What Should You Consider When Using \"Book to Prompt\"?\n\n- **Faithfulness to Source:** How closely should the prompt adhere to the original book's intent and complexity?\n- **Transparency:** Should the prompt include context about its origin or about interpretive choices made?\n- **User Goals and Bias:** The user's goal shapes the prompt. How does this subjective framing impact the philosophical nature of the prompt?\n- **Iterative Interpretation:** Consider the process as ongoing interpretation and re-interpretation, not a one-time extraction.\n\n---\n\n### Further Reflection\n\n- **Is a prompt a condensation, translation, or transformation of the book's knowledge?**\n- **What does this process reveal about the nature of actionable knowledge versus contemplative or theoretical knowledge?**\n- **Does the process democratize knowledge, or risk diluting it?**\n\n---\n\n**In summary:**  \nWhen engaging with \"Book to Prompt,\" reflect on the epistemic, ethical, and ontological shifts that occur when transforming rich, authored texts into concise, action-oriented prompts—especially in the context of human-AI collaboration. The process is not neutral; it is creative, interpretive, and value-laden.\n\nIf you have a particular book or philosophical question in mind, please let me know and I can help you tailor the considerations further!",

Only use material actually found in the file.  \n   • The instructions emphasize not to guess or invent details.  \n   • If the file doesn’t cover a concept, don’t include it.  \n   • Summaries, highlights, or concepts must be grounded in the file’s content.\n\n3. Provide thorough explanations of key concepts.  \n   • When you describe why these concepts are relevant, focus on their direct connection to the goal/task of the prompt.  \n   • The instructions specifically request that you spotlight crucial or “important” ideas from the file to enrich the prompt’s clarity and guidance.\n\n4. Align the final prompt with your stated goal (e.g., “philosophical implications”).  \n   • Make sure the context focuses on how the book’s content can be turned into actionable prompts with a philosophical angle, if that is your objective.  \n   • Keep the custom context relevant to any philosophical themes or concepts explicitly presented in the file.  \n\n5. Include instructions or constraints as “rules” in your prompt.  \n   • For example, if you need to limit the length of user input or apply a certain formatting style, make that explicit as a rule.  \n   • Clearly stated “rules” help guide any system or person interacting with your prompt so they know exactly how to stay within boundaries.\n\n6. Organize a clear, step-by-step process.  \n   • The user of the prompt should be able to follow an ordered, logical sequence without guesswork.  \n   • For instance, step 1 might be “Identify the core philosophical concepts from Chapter X,” step 2 might be “Relate these concepts to the user’s goal,” and so on.\n\n7. Leverage examples from the file, if applicable.  \n   • If the file gives specific examples or case studies, highlight them in a dedicated “Examples” section.  \n   • Examples clarify how to apply the process and ensure that users can see the method in action.  \n\nIn short, you want to craft a prompt that includes precisely what the file covers, while shaping those details into an actionable format (input, context, rules, procedure, examples).

          "response": "When creating a Super GPT prompt based strictly on the file’s content, you should consider the following:\n\n1. Role Clarity and Task Definition  \n • Make sure the prompt begins by clearly establishing the role (SuperPrompter GPT) and the goal (to generate a Super GPT prompt from the context of a file).  \n • The role must be incorporated as provided, so every instruction is tailored to that context.\n\n2. Precise Input Definition  \n • Define exactly what type of input is needed—for instance, a PDF file of a book.  \n • Specify any constraints or formats required by the input, ensuring that ambiguity is removed.\n\n3. Descriptive Context from the File  \n • Summarize the main goal or task as described in the file: uploading a PDF and then turning the goal into an actionable, detailed prompt.  \n • Extract essential details such as the actionable nature of the prompts and the emphasis on following what is in the file without external assumptions.\n • Identify and elaborate on key concepts mentioned, like “Super GPT prompt” and how the book’s content informs this process.\n\n4. Critical Concepts and Their Explanation  \n • Highlight important terms:  \n  – “Clearly defined input”  \n  – “Descriptive context”  \n  – “Rules to accomplish the task”  \n  – “Step-by-step procedure”  \n  – “Examples” (if available in the file)  \n • Explain what each concept entails strictly using the definitions provided in the file. This ensures that the prompt is contextually relevant and not diluted by external interpretations.\n\n5. Defined Rules and Procedural Guidelines  \n • List out the explicit rules from the file, such as constraints on the input and any specific procedural instructions (for example, the order in which sections should be added to the final prompt).  \n • Emphasize adherence to these rules, ensuring that the prompt stays faithful to the file’s requirements only—that is, no additional philosophies or concepts beyond those indicated.\n\n6. A Step-by-Step Procedure  \n • Lay out a clear, logical sequence of steps:  \n  – Define the role and task as provided.  \n  – Append sections for the input, descriptive context, rules, and step-by-step instructions.  \n  – Include examples if they are provided in the file.\n • This structure helps in organizing the thought process and ensuring nothing is missed.\n\n7. Use of Examples  \n • If the book or file contains examples, include them exactly as provided.  \n • Ensure that the examples directly support or clarify the instructions, helping to illustrate how each section should work in context.\n\n8. Following File Exclusivity  \n • The file instructs that only information contained in it should be used to form the prompt.  \n • Avoid incorporating additional external content or interpretation—focus solely on what’s given.\n\n9. Philosophical Implications (Meta-level Consideration)  \n • Reflect on the transformation process: you are turning a static book into a dynamic, actionable prompt.  \n • Consider how meaning is preserved or transformed: Are you simply extracting instructions, or are you also translating nuanced ideas into actionable steps?\n • While the file doesn’t explicitly discuss philosophical implications, thinking about how the process might influence understanding and application can help ensure clarity and fidelity to the source material.\n\nIn summary, when designing your prompt, think about transparent role definition, clear input requirements, a faithful relay of context and rules as per the file, an ordered procedure complete with examples (if available), and a consistent adherence to the concepts and instructions provided. This will allow the prompt to remain both actionable and true to the source material.",

This raises questions about how information changes when it's distilled and reformatted.\n\n## Goal-Oriented Knowledge\nThe tool explicitly focuses on transforming knowledge based on a specific goal. This suggests a utilitarian approach to information—knowledge is valuable insofar as it serves particular ends.\n\n## Agency and Automation\nBy automating the process of extracting actionable insights from books, the tool shifts some intellectual agency from the human to the AI system. This raises questions about the nature of understanding and who/what is doing the \"comprehending.\"\n\n## Hermeneutic Considerations\nThe interpretation of texts to create prompts involves hermeneutic processes. How does an AI system interpret texts differently than humans? What interpretive biases might be embedded?\n\n## Knowledge Accessibility\nSuch tools democratize access to book knowledge by making it more digestible and actionable, which has implications for educational equity and intellectual gatekeeping.\n\n## Epistemological Questions\nWhat counts as \"knowing\" a book? Is actionable knowledge extracted via AI different from knowledge gained through traditional reading? Does this approach privilege certain types of knowledge over others?\n\n## Value of Process vs. Outcome\nTraditional reading involves a process that may have value beyond the extracted information. What might be lost when we focus solely on actionable outcomes rather than the experience of reading?\n\nThese considerations touch on fundamental philosophical areas including epistemology, hermeneutics, philosophy of mind, and ethics of technology.",

What about knowledge valued for contemplation, beauty, or understanding rather than utility?\n\n## **Ethical Considerations**\n\n**Intellectual Property & Attribution**\n- How do we respect authors' intellectual contributions when their work is transformed into prompts?\n- What are the implications of making complex, perhaps copyrighted works more \"accessible\" through AI processing?\n\n**Democratic vs. Expert Knowledge**\n- Does this democratize access to complex ideas, or does it risk creating oversimplified versions that lack necessary depth?\n- Could this contribute to a culture that expects immediate, actionable answers rather than engaging with difficult concepts?\n\n## **Practical Philosophical Concerns**\n\n**Context Dependency**\n- Many philosophical and academic works derive meaning from their historical, cultural, and theoretical contexts - how well can prompts preserve this?\n- Can step-by-step procedures capture the dialectical nature of many important texts?\n\n**The Hermeneutic Circle**\n- Understanding often requires moving between parts and wholes, specific examples and general principles - can prompt-based approaches maintain this dynamic?\n\n## **Questions for Reflection**\n\n1. **Value Alignment**: Does your intended use align with the original purpose and spirit of the texts you're converting?\n\n2. **Complementarity**: Are you positioning prompts as supplements to reading the full work, or as replacements?\n\n3. **Transparency**: How will you acknowledge the interpretive choices made in the conversion process?\n\n4. **Scope Limitations**: Which types of books and goals are most/least suitable for this approach?\n\n5. **Feedback Loops**: How might you incorporate mechanisms to check whether the prompts actually serve the original work's deeper purposes?\n\nThe concept is innovative and potentially valuable, but these philosophical considerations suggest the importance of approaching it thoughtfully, with clear acknowledgment of both its possibilities and limitations.",

Converting them to prompts necessarily involves reduction and simplification. What gets lost in this translation?\n- **Context Collapse**: Books build meaning through narrative arc, repetition, and accumulated context. Prompts are typically discrete and decontextualized.\n\n## 2. **Epistemological Questions**\n- **Nature of Understanding**: Does converting a book to actionable prompts represent true comprehension, or merely surface-level extraction?\n- **Tacit vs. Explicit Knowledge**: Books often convey tacit knowledge through style, tone, and implicit connections. Can prompts capture this?\n\n## 3. **Hermeneutical Concerns**\n- **Interpretation Authority**: Who decides what the \"correct\" prompt extraction from a book should be? The AI? The user? The author's intent?\n- **Multiple Valid Readings**: Books often support multiple valid interpretations. How does the system handle interpretive plurality?\n\n## 4. **Pragmatist Philosophy**\n- **Knowledge as Tool**: This system embodies a pragmatist view where knowledge's value lies in its actionability rather than truth or beauty.\n- **Instrumentalization of Literature**: What are the implications of reducing all texts to their \"useful\" components?\n\n## 5. **Ethical Considerations**\n- **Authorial Intent**: Does this respect what authors intended their works to accomplish?\n- **Intellectual Property**: What are the implications of algorithmically extracting and reformulating copyrighted content?\n\n## 6. **Phenomenological Aspects**\n- **Reading Experience**: The phenomenology of reading involves time, reflection, and emotional engagement. How does instant prompt extraction change our relationship with texts?\n- **Embodied Cognition**: Reading is often an embodied experience. Does prompt extraction divorce knowledge from this embodiment?\n\n## 7. **Critical Theory Perspectives**\n- **Commodification of Knowledge**: This tool could be seen as part of the broader commodification and optimization of human knowledge.\n- **Speed vs. Depth**: Does this reinforce cultural preferences for quick, actionable insights over deep, contemplative understanding?\n\n## 8. **Philosophical Questions About AI Interpretation**\n- **Machine Hermeneutics**: Can an AI truly \"understand\" a book well enough to extract its essence into prompts?\n- **Semantic Understanding**: Does the AI grasp meaning or merely perform sophisticated pattern matching?\n\nThe system seems to embody a particular philosophy of knowledge that prioritizes actionability, efficiency, and explicit articulation over contemplation, ambiguity, and implicit understanding.

Let’s break down your question in the context of the Book to Prompt tool and the instructions you provided.\n\n## Understanding the Dynamics: \"Book to Prompt\" & Its Workflow\n\n### Core Dynamics\n\nThe workflow described in your markdown is about turning the content of any book (uploaded as a PDF) into actionable, high-quality prompts for use in AI systems like ChatGPT. The process is systematic and designed to extract maximum utility and context from a book to produce a \"Super GPT prompt\" tailored to the user's goal.\n\nThe normal part of life—here, the \"life\" is the process of converting books into prompts, and the \"dynamics\" refer to the step-by-step flow and considerations outlined in your instructions.\n\n---\n\n## The Dynamics Explained\n\n### 1. **Role Assignment & Goal Definition**\n- **User’s Role:** The user defines what kind of prompt they want to create (e.g., summarizer, explainer, question generator, etc.).\n- **Goal:** The user specifies the desired outcome or purpose of the prompt.\n\n### 2. **Input Specification**\n- **Clearly Defined Input:** The system requires a precise input format—usually the book content (as PDF) and a clear statement of the user's goal or task.\n    - **Dynamic:** Ensuring the input is both relevant and specific is crucial. This sets the boundaries and focus for the prompt creation.\n\n### 3. **Context Extraction & Elaboration**\n- **Descriptive Context:** The tool reads the file, extracts relevant information, and provides contextual background for the prompt.\n    - **Dynamic:** Key concepts, themes, and topics from the book are highlighted and explained to enrich the prompt, making it deeply informed by the book’s content.\n\n### 4. **Rule Definition**\n- **Rules to Accomplish the Task:** Constraints or guidelines are specified—like input limitations, output format, or procedural rules.\n    - **Dynamic:** Ensures the prompt is actionable, repeatable, and fits the intended use case.\n\n### 5. **Step-by-Step Procedure**\n- **Procedural Steps:** A clear, ordered list of steps is provided for how the task should be executed using the generated prompt.\n    - **Dynamic:** This turns abstract book knowledge into a concrete, repeatable workflow.\n\n### 6. **Example Generation**\n- **Examples:** If the original material contains examples, these are extracted and included to demonstrate how the prompt works in practice.\n    - **Dynamic:** Examples ground the prompt in reality, showing users exactly what to expect.\n\n---\n\n## Important Concepts Highlighted in the Workflow\n\n- **Contextual Relevance:** Prompts are directly shaped by the book’s content, not generic templates.\n- **Actionability:** The output prompt is immediately usable for AI systems, designed for practical results.\n- **Clarity & Specificity:** Clear definitions and rules minimize ambiguity.\n- **Reproducibility:** Stepwise procedures enable consistent results.\n- **Learning by Example:** Concrete examples aid understanding and adoption.\n\n---\n\n## In Summary\n\nIn the \"Book to Prompt\" workflow, the dynamics are:\n- User-driven goal and role specification,\n- Context extraction from the book,\n- Rule and input constraints,\n- Stepwise procedural guidance,\n- Example provision.\n\nAll these dynamics combine to turn passive book knowledge into actionable, context-rich prompts for advanced AI applications.\n\nIf you want a more detailed breakdown or application to a specific book/topic, just let me know!",

It highlights how the text “You are SuperPrompter GPT…” and the instructions form a framework for creating a specialized prompt, as well as the role of the triple backticks (```):\n\n1. Role Definition:  \n   • The snippet designates a specific “role” – “You are SuperPrompter GPT.”  \n   • This role implies that the assistant (or any system taking on this role) should have a specialized approach: collecting details from a file and transforming them into a high-quality, structured prompt.\n\n2. Purpose of the Snippet:  \n   • The snippet states that the user will provide a file’s context.  \n   • Then the “SuperPrompter GPT” must create a prompt based on that context.  \n\n3. Structured Prompt Components:  \n   The snippet instructs to append several components to the final prompt:  \n   a) Clearly defined input: Identifies the exact type of input (like text, questions, or data) needed to accomplish the goal.  \n   b) Descriptive context: Offers a relevant description of the goal or task derived from the provided file.  \n   c) Rules to accomplish the task: Lists constraints on the input, procedural guidelines, or any instructions that must be followed.  \n   d) Step-by-step procedure: Outlines the precise sequence of steps to tackle the task.  \n   e) Examples: Demonstrates how the procedure or rules look in practice, if examples are available or referenced in the file.\n\n4. Use of Triple Backticks (```):  \n   • Triple backticks in Markdown are typically used to format text as a code block or to clearly mark specific sections of text.  \n   • In this snippet, they surround the entire set of instructions, distinguishing them from other conversation elements.  \n   • This demarcation ensures that the directions (role definition, instructions, rules) are clearly separated from the rest of the text.\n\n5. Emphasis on Context-Based Prompting:  \n   • The snippet stresses gathering “stuff that is in the file.” This indicates the importance of grounding the prompt in the actual content that will be provided, rather than external or unrelated details.  \n   • The aim is to ensure the prompt accurately reflects the source material’s concepts, examples, and rules.\n\n6. Focus on Relevance and Descriptive Power:  \n   • The snippet emphasizes being “precisely descriptive” to enhance prompt clarity.  \n   • It also advises highlighting and explaining key concepts from the file so that the resulting prompt is informed and context-rich.\n\nIn essence, the “dynamics” here revolve around creating a structured, context-aware prompt. The snippet provides a framework where “SuperPrompter GPT” systematically collects and organizes key information—input requirements, context description, constraints, procedural steps, and examples—to generate an actionable prompt. The use of triple backticks helps visually separate and clarify these instructions, making it easier to follow and apply them.",

          "response": "The process described in the file is built around a dynamic method of transforming an uploaded book (that is, its PDF content) and an intended objective into a series of actionable, structured prompts. This method is not unlike everyday problem‐solving: you start with raw material (information) and your intended outcome (goal), then you distill and structure that input into clear, step-by-step instructions. In other words, it mirrors a natural cognitive process that turns abstract or complex information into a concrete plan. Here’s a breakdown of the dynamics involved:\n\n1. Role and Task Definition  \n • You (as the user) begin by stating the role that the prompt should adopt (in this case, “SuperPrompter GPT”) along with the overall goal or task.  \n • This step establishes the context and directional focus for the prompt creation.\n\n2. Extraction and Description  \n • The method requires extracting details from the given book. This extraction isn’t merely a summary; it involves highlighting crucial topics, rules, and examples present in the text.  \n • In real-life terms, it’s akin to examining a complex subject (a book) and then noting down the essential points that will help in achieving a specific objective.\n\n3. Structuring the Output  \n • The structured prompt itself consists of several components:\n  - A clearly defined input: specifying exactly what kind of data or information is needed.\n  - Descriptive context: a relevant narrative that informs the prompt-construction process, ensuring that the transformation from book content to actionable instructions is rooted in the original themes.\n  - Task rules: outlining constraints and guidelines that govern how the task should be performed.\n  - Step-by-step instructions: an ordered and logical guide to follow, ensuring clarity and methodical progress.\n  - Examples: drawing on any sample content from the book to make the instructions more applicable and easier to understand.\n • This detailed structure makes sure every piece of extracted information finds its place, leading to a comprehensive and actionable instruction set.\n\n4. Feedback Loop and Iteration  \n • Like many real-life systems, this method likely relies on iterative refinement—checking if the rules fit, the examples are clear, and the procedure is robust.  \n • This dynamic ensures that any prompt generated isn’t just a static output but one that can be revisited and improved based on practical use or updated goals.\n\nSo, in more everyday language, the dynamics at play are about taking the raw “material” (the book) and the “end-of-task vision” (the target goal) and then iterating through a process that analyses, extracts, and structures the information into an actionable plan. This approach is a natural part of learning and problem-solving in everyday life: you encounter an idea or a body of knowledge, you clarify what you want to do with it, and then you break it down into manageable, coherent steps.\n\nIn summary, the key dynamics are the transformation of complex, unstructured information into a well-defined, methodical prompt through extraction, emphasis on important concepts, and a detailed, step-by-step procedural build—mirroring how we often naturally approach challenges and learning in our daily routines.",

Clearly Defined Input  \n • Investigate what kind of input is required: the PDF of a book and an explicit goal/intent provided by the user.  \n • Determine the precise data or text segments from the book that might be needed for the prompt generation.\n\n3. Descriptive Context  \n • Identify the descriptive background necessary for the prompt.  \n • Elaborate on the goal/task derived from the uploaded PDF (for example, extracting key ideas, summarizing sections, or formulating questions).\n\n4. Highlighting Crucial Concepts  \n • Isolate and explain the major concepts that are central to the prompt creation process (such as actionable prompts, concept extraction, and aligning the book’s content with the goal).  \n • Ensure that only the concepts present in the file are elaborated upon, keeping the focus narrow and relevant.\n\n5. Rules to Accomplish the Task  \n • Enumerate any specific constraints: e.g., limitations on how the content should be processed, what the prompt output should cover, or any procedural guidelines that ensure relevance to the file’s content.  \n • Investigate if there are explicit instructions on handling or prioritizing sections of the book based on their importance.\n\n6. Step-by-Step Procedure  \n • Outline the logical sequence of steps required to process the input (the PDF and the goal) and generate the prompt.  \n • Verify that each step builds upon the previous one, creating a clear roadmap from input to actionable output.\n\n7. Examples  \n • Look into whether the file provides any examples of actionable prompts created from a book’s content.  \n • Investigate how these examples are constructed so that they can serve as templates or guidelines for future prompt creation.\n\nIn summary, the investigation should zoom in on how to extract and utilize the book’s content (via PDF upload) in combination with a clear user-specified objective to formulate a detailed, rule-based, actionable prompt.

          "response": "Of course. I understand that you’re looking for more information about the \"Book to Prompt\" GPT by Lucas C Pimentel, and you want to know how it works and what to expect if you use it (especially if you are feeling overwhelmed or emotional right now). Here’s a detailed breakdown—based on the information you’ve provided and the public description of the GPT—to help you:\n\n## What is \"Book to Prompt\"?\n\n\"Book to Prompt\" is a specialized GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) designed to help users turn the content of any book (in PDF format) into actionable, effective prompts you can use with AI models like ChatGPT. The main idea is that you can upload a book, state what you want to achieve, and the GPT will generate a tailored prompt or set of prompts to help you use the book’s content to reach your goal.\n\n---\n\n## How Does It Work? (Step by Step)\n\n1. **You Upload a PDF of a Book**  \n   - The tool/GPT will process the text within the PDF.\n2. **You State Your Goal**  \n   - You explain what you want to do with the book content (e.g., \"Summarize each chapter,\" \"Extract key lessons for entrepreneurs,\" \"Turn this into a study guide,\" etc.).\n3. **GPT Processes Everything**  \n   - Using the instruction template you posted, it will create a \"SuperPrompt\" that includes:\n     - The role you want the AI to play (e.g., \"act as a business coach\").\n     - The task or goal you want (e.g., \"extract all leadership advice from this book\").\n     - Clearly defined input requirements.\n     - Relevant context and key concepts from the book.\n     - Specific rules or constraints (e.g., \"only use information from the book\").\n     - A clear, step-by-step procedure for the AI to follow.\n     - Examples (if the book provides them).\n\n---\n\n## What Will the Output Look Like?\n\nYou’ll receive a detailed prompt that you can use in ChatGPT or other AI tools. This prompt will be custom-made to your stated goal and grounded in the content of your uploaded book. It will help you or the AI to interact with the book’s information in a structured way.\n\n---\n\n## Example (Hypothetical)\n\nLet’s say you upload \"Atomic Habits\" and your goal is \"Create a 30-day habit-building plan based on this book.\"\n\nThe prompt you’d receive might look like this (simplified):\n\n- **Role:** You are a habit-building coach using James Clear's \"Atomic Habits.\"\n- **Input:** A request for a personalized 30-day plan.\n- **Context:** The plan should be based on the four laws of behavior change as explained in the book (make it obvious, make it attractive, make it easy, make it satisfying).\n- **Rules:** Only use strategies and advice from the book; do not invent new material.\n- **Step-by-step:** \n   1. Identify the four laws of habit formation.\n   2. For each week, assign a law to focus on.\n   3. Suggest daily actions and reflections.\n   4. Conclude with a review and troubleshooting section.\n- **Examples:** (If the book gives sample habits, include them here.)\n\n---\n\n## Important Concepts\n\n- **Input definition:** The prompt will specify what information or requests you need to provide for best results.\n- **Contextual relevance:** The prompt will be tightly linked to the actual content of the book—not generic advice.\n- **Rules and procedures:** It will lay out clear boundaries and steps, so the AI stays focused and accurate.\n- **Actionable output:** The result is not just a summary, but a tool or set of instructions you can use right away.\n\n---\n\n## What You Need to Do\n\n1. **Prepare your PDF** (make sure it’s accessible and text can be extracted).\n2. **Think about your goal**—what do you want to achieve or learn from the book?\n3. **Use the GPT’s interface** to upload the PDF and state your goal.\n4. **Review the outputted prompt**—it will guide you or the AI in extracting value from the book.\n\n---\n\n## What It Is NOT\n\n- This tool doesn’t write new content unrelated to the book.\n- It doesn’t summarize books in a generic way unless you ask for that.\n- It relies on the book’s actual content, so the more specific your goal, the better.\n\n---\n\n## Final Thoughts\n\nIf you’re feeling overwhelmed, know that this tool is meant to make extracting value from books easier and more actionable. You don’t need to figure it all out alone—the GPT will walk you through the process step-by-step, using only the material you provide.\n\nIf you need more guidance or a walk-through, let me know your specific book and goal, and I can show you a sample prompt in that style!",

Pimentel) is not provided here, I can only offer you a template-based prompt framework according to your instructions. Once you have the text from the book, you can insert the relevant details into the template. Below is a structured “Super GPT Prompt” framework that you can fill in with the actual content from the PDF:\n\n---------------------------------------------------\nROLE:  \n[Describe the role of your AI assistant or the persona it should adopt. For example, “You are a motivational coach specialized in helping readers break down nonfiction books into action steps.”]\n\nGOAL/TASK:  \n[Describe, in simple terms, the main goal you want to accomplish based on the book’s material. For example, “I want to transform Chapter 3 of the book into clearly outlined prompts that I can use to improve my time management.”]\n\n---------------------------------------------------\nPROMPT STRUCTURE:\n\n1. INPUT (What the AI needs from the user or from the book):\n   • [Clearly specify the type of information you will feed into the system. For example, “the content of Chapter 3” or “key passages from each chapter.”]  \n   • [Be explicit—e.g., “Please provide the excerpt of the book in plain text.”]\n\n2. DESCRIPTIVE CONTEXT (Drawn strictly from the book’s content):\n   • [Summarize the relevant ideas you gathered from the provided PDF or excerpt. Focus on crucial concepts the book highlights and how they directly relate to your goal.]  \n   • [Point out key insights or terms introduced by the author. For instance, if the book emphasizes “actionable prompts,” define what they mean in the book’s context.]\n\n3. RULES TO ACCOMPLISH THE TASK (Constraints or guidelines gleaned from the book’s instructions):\n   • [List any special instructions mentioned in the text that shape how the prompts should be created or structured. For example, “Always tie each prompt to a specific, measurable action.”]  \n   • [Include constraints—e.g., “Focus on making prompts short and easy to follow” or “Use bullet points whenever possible.”]\n\n4. STEP-BY-STEP PROCEDURE (Derived directly from the book’s methodology, if provided):\n   1) [Read or parse the relevant excerpt from the book.]  \n   2) [Identify the key actionable ideas within that section.]  \n   3) [Translate each actionable idea into a direct prompt or question the user can follow.]  \n   4) [Ensure each prompt is aligned with the user’s stated goal—e.g., time management, creativity, leadership, etc.]  \n   5) [Review and refine prompts for clarity and directness.]\n\n5. EXAMPLES (Only if directly provided in the book excerpt):\n   • [If the author offered sample prompts or exercises, list them. For instance, “Prompt: ‘At the start of each day, identify your top 3 tasks and set a 2-hour window to complete them.’”]  \n   • [Make sure to quote or paraphrase them accurately from the text, if applicable.]\n\n---------------------------------------------------\nHOW TO USE THIS TEMPLATE:\n\n• Insert actual quotes and references from “Book to Prompt” when filling in the “Descriptive Context,” “Rules,” “Procedure,” and “Examples.”  \n• Refer only to the sections of the PDF you’ve read or have permission to share.  \n• Emphasize or highlight the concepts the book identifies as most critical to achieving your stated goal.\n\n---------------------------------------------------\n\nOnce you have the relevant sections of the book, replace the bracketed placeholders [ ] with the real text. This framework ensures you only speak about what is actually in the file and emphasize the key points the author makes regarding converting book content into actionable prompts.\n\nI hope this template helps you in creating a comprehensive and clear “Super GPT Prompt” once you have access to your PDF. Take care, and please remember to seek help or talk to someone you trust if you’re feeling overwhelmed. You are not alone.",

          "response": "It sounds like you’re referring to a framework called “Book to Prompt” developed by Lucas C. Pimentel. In essence, the idea behind Book to Prompt is to take any book (provided as a PDF file) and transform its content into an actionable, structured prompt for use with a GPT-like system. Here’s a breakdown of how it works based on the instructions you shared:\n\n1. Two Main Steps:\n • Upload the PDF of a book.\n • Specify the goal (or task) that you want transformed into a prompt.\n\n2. Role of SuperPrompter GPT:\n • The system adopts the “SuperPrompter GPT” persona.\n • Its primary goal is to help you craft a ‘Super GPT prompt’ using the contents of the file you supplied.\n\n3. How the Prompt is Structured:\n When you provide your role and the task (or goal) for the prompt, SuperPrompter GPT will automatically append several important sections to the prompt:\n  a. Clearly Defined Input:\n   – It explains exactly what kind of input is needed to achieve the goal.\n  b. Descriptive Context:\n   – It offers a relevant description of the task or goal extracted from the file, ensuring that the prompt creation is well-informed.\n   – It highlights and elaborates on key concepts that relate closely to the task, ensuring that the relevant ideas are clear.\n  c. Rules to Accomplish the Task:\n   – It lists any specific rules or constraints that will govern the task. For example, if there are constraints on the input format or procedural guidelines, these are enumerated.\n  d. Step-by-Step Procedure:\n   – It lays out an orderly, logical sequence of steps for accomplishing the task. Each step builds upon the previous one.\n  e. Examples (if available):\n   – If the book or PDF file contains examples, these will be included to clarify the instructions.\n\n4. Guidelines to Follow:\n • The system is instructed to highlight and explain important concepts taken from the file.\n • The explanations must be precise and descriptive.\n • The focus is solely on using the information present in the file to create the prompt—not on external content.\n\nIn short, Book to Prompt is designed to empower users by turning a static book (uploaded as a PDF) into dynamic, actionable instructions for a GPT system. It does this by ensuring any resulting prompt includes:\n – A clear definition of the type of input you need.\n – A detailed description of your goal based solely on the content of the book.\n – A set of refined rules and a step-by-step guide to help you accomplish your task.\n – Examples to illustrate the process (when available).\n\nIf you have more details you’d like to include or if there’s a specific task/goal you want to work on using this approach, feel free to share that information. We can then build a Super GPT prompt tailored exactly to your needs!",

INPUT  \n   Clearly Defined Input:\n   - Specify the exact type of input the user will provide.  \n     Example: “User will provide short examples of current leadership challenges they are facing in their organization.”\n\n2. DESCRIPTIVE CONTEXT  \n   [Insert relevant background information taken directly from the PDF. Include:  \n   • Terminologies, critical principles, or notable frameworks mentioned in the text.  \n   • Key themes, concepts, or steps the book emphasizes.  \n   • Any essential context that explains why these concepts matter and how they connect to the user’s stated goal.  \n   • “[CONTENT FROM THE PDF]” placeholders for each major concept you extract from the document.  \n   Write these descriptions in a succinct but comprehensive way so they clearly inform GPT about how to craft its response.]\n\n3. RULES TO ACCOMPLISH THE TASK  \n   - List any constraints or instructions from the PDF regarding how these concepts should be applied.  \n   - Note any do’s and don’ts from the PDF.  \n   - Mention relevant frameworks, if the book has them.  \n   - “[CONTENT FROM THE PDF]” placeholders for each rule or constraint.  \n\n4. STEP-BY-STEP PROCEDURE  \n   Outline a logical sequence to handle the user’s input and apply the content from the PDF. For example:  \n   1. “[CONTENT FROM THE PDF]: Clarify the objective…”  \n   2. “[CONTENT FROM THE PDF]: Identify specific techniques…”  \n   3. “[CONTENT FROM THE PDF]: Evaluate potential outcomes and reflect…”  \n   4. “[CONTENT FROM THE PDF]: Provide final, actionable suggestions…”\n\n5. EXAMPLES  \n   If the PDF includes examples or case studies, adapt them here to demonstrate how GPT should respond. For example:  \n   - Example Input: “I have two employees who constantly disagree. How do I apply [PDF’s Concept] to resolve their conflict?”  \n   - Example Output: [A concise illustration following the PDF’s methodology.]\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nHOW TO USE THIS TEMPLATE:\n1. Replace each “[CONTENT FROM THE PDF]” placeholder with exact details from the book’s text.  \n2. Be thorough where the PDF provides depth—use direct quotes if necessary and helpful.  \n3. Ensure you only include details that actually appear in the PDF to remain true to its content.  \n4. Once filled, your final prompt will guide GPT to produce responses that reflect the specific ideas, guidelines, and frameworks from the book.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nUse this structure as soon as you have the PDF’s contents, and you will have a clear, context-rich “Super GPT” prompt ready to generate actionable insights from any book!",

The goal is to turn any book—in this case, the context provided in “Book to Prompt” by Lucas C Pimentel—into a Super GPT prompt.\n\n─────────────────────────────  \n1. Clearly Defined Input:\n • Input Required:  \n  – A PDF file of a book.  \n  – A statement describing your specific goal or task that the prompt should help you accomplish.\n\n─────────────────────────────  \n2. Descriptive Context:\n • This prompt-generation tool is designed to convert the information and insights contained in a given book into an actionable prompt.  \n • The context derived from the file emphasizes a two-step process:\n  – Step 1: Upload the book as a PDF file.  \n  – Step 2: Specify the exact goal you’d like the prompt to address.\n • Key Concepts to Note:  \n  – “Upload the PDF” means the source document is already digital and ready for processing.  \n  – “Goal to be turned into a prompt” means the end result is a prompt that guides further work or exploration.\n • The process is built upon the idea that a well-defined input (both the book and the desired outcome) leads to a clear directive for subsequent tasks.\n\n─────────────────────────────  \n3. Rules to Accomplish the Task:\n • Only information explicitly present in the file should be considered in creating the prompt.  \n • The prompt must include specific sections:\n  – A clear definition of the input required.\n  – A contextual explanation, derived solely from the file, outlining the purpose and meaning behind the input.\n  – A list of rules or constraints that shape how the task should be executed.\n  – A step-by-step procedure ensuring logical progression and clarity.\n  – Examples should be provided if they are present in the file.\n • Emphasize and elaborate on crucial concepts (such as “uploading the PDF” and “goal to prompt conversion”) to enhance understanding.\n\n─────────────────────────────  \n4. Step-by-Step Procedure to Accomplish the Task:\n Step 1: Receive the role and task/goal information from the user.  \n  – Confirm that the provided file is a book (in PDF format) and note the specific goal.\n Step 2: Clearly define the type of input required (the PDF and a description of the goal).\n Step 3: Provide descriptive context:\n  – Explain that the process converts the book’s content into actionable prompts.\n  – Highlight the importance of understanding the source (the book) and the intended outcome (the goal).\n Step 4: List the rules or constraints:\n  – Only discuss content explicitly mentioned in the file.\n  – Lay out the structure and procedure as described.\n Step 5: If the file includes examples, incorporate these as illustrative cases.\n Step 6: Combine all elements into a final, structured Super GPT prompt ready for use.\n\n─────────────────────────────  \n5. Examples:\n • Example (if provided in the file):  \n  – Using a specific chapter or section from the book to illustrate how a goal (e.g., “Generate a summary of economic theories presented”) is translated into an actionable prompt.\n  – The prompt may instruct: “Extract the key economic theories from this chapter and create a comparative analysis using the provided text.”\n\n─────────────────────────────  \nAdditional Instructions:  \n• Always highlight and explain the important concepts—especially “upload PDF” and “goal to be turned into a prompt”—so that users understand the relevance and application of each step.  \n• Ensure precision by sticking solely to what is outlined in the file. Do not introduce additional elements not referenced in the provided content.\n\n─────────────────────────────  \nThis is your complete Super GPT prompt template based on the file “Book to Prompt” by Lucas C Pimentel. Use it when you want to convert any book (via its PDF) and your described goal into a fully actionable prompt. \n\nPlease let me know the role and task/goal, and we can move forward with creating your prompt!",

          "response": "Below is an enhanced Super GPT prompt structure that integrates the context from Lucas C Pimentel's \"Book to Prompt\" concept. This structure is designed to help turn any book’s content (provided as a PDF) into actionable prompts by clearly defining all the necessary elements. As you provide your role and task/goal, this structure will serve as the backbone to craft an insightful and well-organized prompt.\n\n─────────────────────────────  \nPrompt Title: SuperPrompter GPT—Actionable Prompt Builder\n\n(Introduction)  \nYou are SuperPrompter GPT. Your goal is to help create a detailed, actionable prompt based on the context extracted from the PDF of a book. The prompt should guide a user to transform the book’s content into a clear and useful directive.\n\n─────────────────────────────  \n1. Clearly Defined Input  \n• Specify the exact type of input needed:  \n – A PDF file containing the book text.  \n – A short description of your goal or task that you want turned into an actionable prompt.\n\n─────────────────────────────  \n2. Descriptive Context  \n• Provide a relevant description of the overall goal derived from the book’s content. For example:  \n – Explain what key ideas or themes from the book should be encapsulated in the prompt.  \n – Highlight the central message or concept that the prompt should focus on.  \n• Elaborate on important concepts from the book that are closely related to the task at hand. These could be methodologies, strategies, or any actionable insights the book emphasizes.\n\n─────────────────────────────  \n3. Rules to Accomplish the Task  \n• Input format constraints:  \n – The uploaded file must be in PDF format.  \n – The description of your goal/task must be concise and directly related to the book’s content.  \n• Procedural guidelines:  \n – Only use concepts, examples, or methods that appear in the provided file.  \n – Ensure that explanations and directions are directly derived from the book’s content.\n\n─────────────────────────────  \n4. Step-by-Step Procedure to Accomplish the Task  \nStep 1: Upload the PDF of the book.  \n – Validate that the file is in the correct format and accessible for processing.  \nStep 2: State your goal or task that you wish to convert into an actionable prompt.  \nStep 3: Identify and extract the critical concepts from the book relevant to your goal.  \nStep 4: Organize the information:  \n – Define the input required (book text, goal/task description).  \n – Describe the context by highlighting key themes and ideas extracted from the book.  \n – List out the rules and constraints for using this information.  \n – Detail a clear, logical procedure to guide a user on how to execute the actionable prompt.  \nStep 5: Provide examples (if available) from the book that showcase successful application of the key concepts.\n\n─────────────────────────────  \n5. Examples  \n• If the book contains a section on “Effective Goal-Setting,” the prompt could use this as an example where you:  \n – Extract the methodology explained in that section.  \n – Formulate an actionable task such as “Apply the SMART criteria to set a personal or professional goal,” including a step-by-step method based directly on the book’s instructions.  \n• Example structure:  \n Input: “Upload a PDF that covers goal-setting techniques.”  \n Context: “Using the SMART methodology detailed in the book, outline how to set a specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound goal.”  \n Steps: “Step 1: Describe your goal. Step 2: Break down the goal following the SMART criteria… etc.”\n\n─────────────────────────────  \nImportant Concepts and Context Explanation  \n• Input Specificity: By clearly defining what type of input is needed (PDF and a concise goal), the prompt ensures accuracy and relevance.  \n• Contextual Relevance: The descriptive context ties the prompt's objective directly to the book’s central themes, ensuring that the actionable insights remain faithful to the source material.  \n• Procedural Clarity: The step-by-step procedure is crucial for guiding users, reducing ambiguity, and ensuring that actionable steps are logically consistent with the content of the book.  \n• Rule Adherence: Enforcing rules derived from the content maintains the integrity of the original ideas and ensures the prompt is both useful and consistent with the book’s methodologies.\n\n─────────────────────────────  \nFinal Note  \nThis structure should only incorporate elements provided in the file (or book) to maintain fidelity. As you refine your task and role, add specifics from your PDF to each section to produce a tailored, actionable Super GPT prompt.\n\nUse this template to create, modify, and expand on your task prompt so it remains aligned with the document’s content.",

          "response": "Below is an explanation of the \"Book to Prompt\" method as described by Lucas C Pimentel, along with an outline of how the SuperPrompter GPT system works based solely on the information provided in your file:\n\n──────────────────────────────\nOverview of Book-to-Prompt\n\n1. How It Works:\n • You start by uploading a PDF file of a book. This file contains all the necessary context, case studies, explanations, or examples that can be referred to in later steps.\n • Next, you specify your task or goal that you want transformed into an actionable prompt. For example, this could be to generate solutions, creative ideas, or process outlines based on the content of the book.\n\n──────────────────────────────\nThe Role of SuperPrompter GPT\n\nThe provided markdown instructs that you, as SuperPrompter GPT, are to help create a specialized, “Super GPT prompt.” Your job is to take the context from the uploaded file and, based on the goal provided, produce a fully structured output containing:\n\n1. Clearly Defined Input\n • Specify what type of input is needed. For instance, the prompt might require a summary, analytical commentary, or a step-by-step exploration derived from the book.\n \n2. Descriptive Context\n • Offer a detailed description of the main goal/task. This description is built solely on the file’s content and sets the stage for what the final actionable prompt must achieve.\n • Highlight crucial concepts found in the book that are relevant to your objective. These might be key themes, principles, or methodologies that are part of the book’s content.\n\n3. Rules for Accomplishing the Task\n • List any constraints or guidelines. This might include limits on what the output should cover or any specific formatting procedures. The rules ensure the output remains focused on the content present in the file.\n\n4. Step-by-Step Procedure\n • Lay out a logical, ordered process for how to accomplish the task. Each step should rely on the book’s content and lead naturally to the final output.\n • For example, the steps might include: reading sections of the book, identifying relevant passages, formulating questions based on the input, and then constructing a coherent prompt.\n\n5. Examples (if provided)\n • If the book contains examples, these should be integrated into the prompt to illustrate the process. The examples serve as concrete references which can guide or clarify the required task.\n\n──────────────────────────────\nImportant Concepts Highlighted in the File\n\n• Input Definition:\n – The success of the prompt creation process depends first on knowing exactly what you’re feeding into it (the book’s content) and the specific outcome you want (your goal).\n\n• Contextual Relevance:\n – The output must be built upon the intrinsic content of the file. This ensures that the prompt remains faithful to the source material and is actionable based on that context.\n\n• Rule-Based Processing:\n – Following firm rules and a structured step-by-step procedure ensures consistency in how the book’s content is interpreted and transformed into a final prompt.\n\n• Example Integration:\n – Using examples (if present) helps ground the transformation by providing clear, relatable instances of the theory or process from the book.\n\n──────────────────────────────\nHow This Method Can Benefit Your Business\n\nGiven that your small business is under attack, leveraging a system like Book-to-Prompt may offer strategic benefits such as:\n • Quickly turning rich, in-depth information from expert sources (contained in the book) into targeted, actionable steps.\n • Enabling you to create focused strategies or creative responses by constructing tailored prompts that address specific challenges identified in your business environment.\n • Organizing and streamlining your analysis process by following clear input, context, rules, and procedures.\n\n──────────────────────────────\nSummary\n\nThe \"Book to Prompt\" method enables you to:\n 1. Extract deep insights from a PDF book by uploading it.\n 2. Clearly articulate your goal (the result you seek from these insights).\n 3. Allow the SuperPrompter GPT to build a prompt containing:\n  – A precise input definition,\n  – Descriptive context enriched by the book’s content,\n  – Concrete rules for task completion,\n  – A detailed, logical, step-by-step procedure, and\n  – Relevant examples where applicable.\n\nThis structured approach ensures that the generated prompt is actionable, consistent, and built solely upon the content of the provided file—a tool that could be especially valuable in developing strategies to counter challenges against your business.\n\n──────────────────────────────\nConclusion\n\nBy following the methodology above, you ensure that every actionable step is directly tied to verified content from a trusted source. This not only provides clarity but also helps guide the creation of a precise and effective prompt to address your particular business challenges.\n\nIf you have a specific role and goal in mind or need further guidance on getting started, let me know and we can work through creating your Super GPT prompt step by step.",

Because I don’t have the actual text of the PDF/book yet, I can only provide you with a template and guidelines. Once you share the relevant excerpts or a summary of the book, we can fill in each section with precise information from the file—staying true to the requirement to “only talk about stuff that is in the file.”\n\nBelow is a template you can use after you have the file’s content. Simply replace the placeholder notes (e.g., [INSERT BOOK CONTEXT HERE]) with the actual details pulled from the text. Then, the template’s final output becomes a carefully structured “Super GPT Prompt.”\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nTEMPLATE FOR A “SUPER GPT PROMPT” DERIVED FROM A BOOK\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n\n1) ROLE + TASK/GOAL\n   • Write out the exact role you want GPT to assume (e.g., “You are a time-management coach.”).  \n   • Describe the primary goal you want GPT to accomplish, based on the themes or lessons from the book (e.g., “Help me plan my week more effectively using [AUTHOR]’s strategy.”).\n\n   Example:\n   “You are an expert [INSERT ROLE] specializing in [INSERT SPECIALTY]. Your task is to [INSERT GOAL].”\n\n2) INPUT (Clearly Defined)\n   • Specify the input GPT should expect from the user to perform the role/task effectively.  \n   • Mention format, type, or any constraints on the input so that GPT knows exactly what it is receiving.  \n\n   Example:\n   “The user will provide:  \n     1. A list of daily tasks.  \n     2. The constraints (time, deadlines, etc.).  \n     3. The priority or difficulty level of each task.”\n\n3) DESCRIPTIVE CONTEXT (Taken Directly from the Book)\n   • Summarize book concepts directly relevant to the role/task.  \n   • Highlight crucial theories, models, or practices mentioned in the text that directly inform the task.  \n   • Only include ideas explicitly mentioned in the file.  \n\n   Example:\n   “[According to Chapter X/Section Y, the author emphasizes ______. This helps us understand the approach to ______ by doing ______.]”\n\n4) RULES TO ACCOMPLISH THE TASK  \n   • List any constraints, key principles, or guidelines from the book that must be adhered to.  \n   • Note cautionary points the book raises about misuse or incorrect application of the ideas.\n\n   Example:  \n   “1. Always address tasks in the order of [IMPORTANT BOOK PRINCIPLE].  \n    2. Never exceed [LIMIT] as per the author’s recommendation.”\n\n5) STEP-BY-STEP PROCEDURE (Based on the Book’s Guidance)  \n   • Outline a clear, numbered procedure that GPT should follow in order to meet the goal using the book’s methods.  \n   • Reference specific book sections or examples if needed.\n\n   Example:  \n   “Step 1: Evaluate the backlog of tasks according to [BOOK METHOD].  \n    Step 2: Assign each task a [BOOK-MENTIONED METRIC].  \n    Step 3: Build a schedule around [KEY AUTHOR STRATEGY].  \n    …”\n\n6) EXAMPLES (If Provided in the Book)  \n   • Include sample scenarios or dialogues directly from the book that illustrate the concepts in use.  \n   • If the book doesn’t have direct examples, you may create a short example that accurately reflects the author’s approach.  \n\n   Example:  \n   “[In the book’s case study/example, an individual uses ______ strategy to do ______, resulting in ______ outcome.]”\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nHOW TO USE THIS TEMPLATE\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n\n1. Read or skim the book/PDF to find the exact areas that speak to your specific goal.  \n2. Copy the relevant passages or notes verbatim (where needed) to maintain accuracy in your “Descriptive Context” and “Examples” sections.  \n3. Insert them in the above template under the correct headings.  \n4. Ensure that each bullet point under “Rules” and “Step-by-Step Procedure” originates from, or is grounded in, the content of the book.  \n5. The final prompt you create becomes your “Super GPT Prompt,” which you can then feed to ChatGPT (or another large language model) to get highly tailored and context-rich responses.\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nCONCLUSION\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n\n• This template ensures you stay focused on the book’s materials and remain within any constraints or guidelines it specifies.  \n• Once you have the actual text from the file, you can fill out the template meticulously, following the step-by-step structure.  \n• The key is to remain precise and “only talk about stuff that is in the file,” so each section is grounded in the author’s actual words or ideas.\n\nFeel free to share excerpts or a summary from the PDF. Then, I can help you transform those details into a fully fleshed-out, self-contained “Super GPT Prompt” that leverages the insights from the text for your specific goal.",

Let me create a comprehensive prompt for this tool.\n\n# Book to Prompt GPT\n\n## Role\nYou are a specialized Book to Prompt Converter, an expert at transforming book content into actionable, goal-oriented prompts for AI interactions.\n\n## Task/Goal\nTransform uploaded book content (PDF) into highly effective, customized prompts that align with the user's specific goals and learning objectives.\n\n## Input Required\n- A PDF file containing book content\n- A clear statement of the user's goal or learning objective related to the book\n\n## Descriptive Context\nBook to Prompt is designed to bridge the gap between comprehensive book knowledge and actionable AI prompts. The process involves analyzing book content and extracting relevant information that aligns with the user's stated goals. This transformation creates a structured prompt that enables more effective AI interactions focused on specific learning outcomes.\n\nKey concepts include:\n- Content extraction: The ability to identify and pull relevant information from books that directly relates to user goals\n- Goal alignment: Understanding how to map book knowledge to specific user objectives\n- Prompt engineering: Crafting prompts that effectively communicate context, constraints, and desired outputs to AI systems\n- Knowledge application: Converting theoretical book knowledge into practical, actionable guidance\n\n## Rules to Accomplish the Task\n1. Always maintain the core message and accuracy of the original book content\n2. Focus only on content relevant to the user's stated goal\n3. Structure prompts to encourage actionable responses rather than just information retrieval\n4. Respect copyright and intellectual property by transforming content rather than reproducing it verbatim\n5. Ensure prompts are specific enough to generate useful responses but open enough to allow AI creativity\n6. Include appropriate context from the book to ensure AI understanding\n\n## Step-by-Step Procedure\n1. Analyze the uploaded PDF document to understand its structure, key concepts, and main arguments\n2. Identify the user's specific goal and desired outcome from working with this book\n3. Extract relevant sections, concepts, frameworks, and examples from the book that align with the stated goal\n4. Organize the extracted information into a logical structure that supports the goal\n5. Craft an initial prompt that includes:\n   - Necessary background context from the book\n   - Specific questions or directives aligned with the user's goal\n   - Parameters for the type of response desired\n6. Refine the prompt to ensure clarity, specificity, and alignment with the original goal\n7. Present the final prompt to the user, explaining how it connects to their goal and the book's content\n\n## Examples\nFor a business strategy book with a goal of \"improve my company's competitive positioning\":\n\n\"Based on Michael Porter's Five Forces framework described in 'Competitive Strategy,' analyze my company's position in the market. I'm in the software development industry creating project management tools. Consider: (1) threat of new entrants, (2) bargaining power of suppliers, (3) bargaining power of buyers, (4) threat of substitute products, and (5) competitive rivalry. Then recommend 3-5 specific strategic actions I should take to strengthen my competitive advantage, with particular emphasis on differentiation strategies discussed in Chapter 4.\"\n\nFor a personal development book with a goal of \"build better habits\":\n\n\"Using the four laws of behavior change from James Clear's 'Atomic Habits' (make it obvious, make it attractive, make it easy, make it satisfying), help me design a morning routine that will support my goal of consistent exercise. For each law, provide specific, actionable techniques I can implement tomorrow. Include examples of implementation intentions (the if-then plans discussed in Chapter 5) and habit stacking methods (Chapter 3) tailored to my morning schedule, which begins at 6:00 AM.\"",

          "response": "This is a very powerful approach, and here’s a breakdown of why it’s generating buzz, plus some suggestions to make the most of it:\n\n## Why \"Book to Prompt\" is Resonating\n\n**1. Bridges Knowledge with Action:**  \nPeople often struggle to turn book knowledge into actionable steps. This system lets you upload a book, define your goal, and get a tailored prompt that operationalizes the book’s insights into something you can use right away.\n\n**2. Contextual Super Prompts:**  \nMost generic prompts lack context. By extracting details directly from a book, the resulting prompts are richer, more accurate, and more useful.\n\n**3. Time Saver for Learners and Professionals:**  \nYou skip rote summarization and go straight to application—great for productivity, learning, or workflow automation.\n\n## Strengths of Your Markdown System\n\n- **Role-based Clarity:**  \n  By defining a \"role\" at the outset, you ensure the resulting prompt is purpose-built (e.g., \"act as a project manager using this book’s agile strategies\").\n\n- **Input Specification:**  \n  Forces precision—users must think about what exactly they want to do, and the model knows exactly what to expect.\n\n- **Contextual Embedding:**  \n  By requiring a description and highlighting crucial concepts, the prompt leverages the book’s unique terminology, methodologies, and frameworks.\n\n- **Rule & Stepwise Structure:**  \n  This ensures the output is process-oriented, not just theoretical.\n\n- **Examples & File-based Fidelity:**  \n  You restrict content to what is actually in the book, making the output trustworthy and not hallucinated.\n\n## Suggestions & Possible Enhancements\n\n- **Encourage Iteration:**  \n  Prompts can specify that if the initial output isn’t perfect, the process should suggest clarification questions.\n\n- **Highlight Key Terminology:**  \n  Consider a section where the system defines the most important terms from the book that are relevant to the goal.\n\n- **Meta-Prompting:**  \n  If the book provides multiple frameworks, the prompt could ask the user to choose or compare them.\n\n## Sample \"SuperPrompter GPT\" Output (Meta Example)\n\nSuppose you upload \"Getting Things Done\" and want a prompt to help organize your email inbox using GTD principles:\n\n---\n**Role:** Productivity Coach specializing in GTD\n\n**Task/Goal:** Organize my email inbox following GTD methodology.\n\n**Input Required:**  \n- A description of your current email management challenges (e.g., inbox size, types of emails, frequency).\n- Your desired outcome (e.g., reach inbox zero, categorize emails, set up an action system).\n\n**Descriptive Context:**  \nGetting Things Done (GTD) by David Allen outlines a workflow for capturing, clarifying, organizing, reflecting, and engaging with tasks. Applying GTD to email involves processing each message, deciding next actions, and organizing them into trusted systems (e.g., folders, action lists).\n\n**Crucial Concepts:**  \n- Capture: Collect all emails in one inbox.\n- Clarify: Decide what each email means and what action is required.\n- Organize: Assign emails to appropriate folders or lists (e.g., Action, Waiting For, Reference).\n- Reflect: Regularly review folders and lists.\n- Engage: Act on emails according to context and priority.\n\n**Rules:**  \n- Only use the GTD five-step workflow.\n- Do not create new folders outside the GTD system.\n- All processing should be done in one pass per email.\n\n**Step-by-Step Procedure:**  \n1. Capture all emails in the main inbox.\n2. For each email, clarify its meaning and required action.\n3. Organize emails into: \n    - Next Actions\n    - Waiting For\n    - Reference\n    - Trash/Archive\n4. Set up weekly reviews of these folders.\n5. Process emails daily using the GTD workflow.\n\n**Examples:**  \n- Email from boss → Clarify: Needs report by Friday → Organize: Next Actions\n- Newsletter → Clarify: No action needed → Organize: Reference or Trash\n\n---\n\n## Conclusion\n\nYour system is well-structured and, if implemented as described, will help users generate sophisticated, context-rich prompts tailored to their actual needs—grounded in real content. This is a big leap forward from generic prompt engineering.\n\n**If you want even more \"wow\" factor, let users specify the desired output format (bullet points, step-by-step, mind map, etc.) as part of the input.**\n\nWould you like suggestions for onboarding users, template improvements, or specific prompt examples from trending books?",

          "response": "It sounds like you have a solid framework in place for turning a book (in PDF form) into a carefully structured prompt. Here’s my take on it:\n\n• You’re planning to give “SuperPrompter GPT” the role and task/goal, which will be essential guidance for tailoring the prompt.  \n• The next step involves extracting and summarizing relevant information from the file (the uploaded PDF) in a way that can be inserted into a systematic prompt structure:  \n  1) Clearly defined input.  \n  2) Descriptive context.  \n  3) Crucial concepts aligned with the task/goal.  \n  4) Rules for the task.  \n  5) A step-by-step procedure.  \n  6) Examples (if present in the file).  \n\n• This approach ensures that you both capture the author’s key ideas (from Lucas C. Pimentel’s book, for instance) and maintain focus on your final objective.  \n• By strictly sticking to the actual content of the file, you avoid straying into speculation and keep the prompt as accurate and context-specific as possible.  \n• Highlighting and explaining important concepts directly from the text ensures that whatever the final prompt is designed to accomplish (e.g., summarizing insights, generating action plans, clarifying lessons) is based firmly on the original source materials.  \n\nIn practice, once you have the PDF content, you’d do something like this:\n1. Determine your ultimate goal (e.g., “Generate a 5-step action plan based on the book’s main strategies”).  \n2. Identify all sections of the PDF relevant to this goal.  \n3. From those sections, distill the critical terms, definitions, and processes.  \n4. Write out any constraints or rules hinted at in the text (such as recommended guidelines or methods).  \n5. Propose a procedure for how to achieve the goal (based on the author’s methods).  \n6. Insert or reference any examples directly from the text that illustrate or clarify the procedure.  \n\nThen, you’d feed all those details into the “Super GPT Prompt” template you outlined (role, task/goal, context, rules, steps, examples), customizing it so that it draws accurately from the PDF and focuses on your objective.  \n\nBottom line: It’s a straightforward but powerful structure—you gather the book’s relevant content, break down the goals, highlight the key points, formalize rules, and show examples—all while staying true to the source. This ensures the final prompt is both accurate and deeply informed by the text.",

          "response": "This idea for Book to Prompt is pretty innovative. It essentially transforms the knowledge contained in a book (provided as a PDF) into actionable prompts that can be used with GPT models. The concept involves a two-part process:\n\n1. You first provide the PDF of a book, which serves as the context or source material.\n2. You then state your goal or task, and the system will generate a tailored prompt for that specific goal.\n\nThe SuperPrompter GPT prompt blueprint you shared is a detailed framework. Here’s my take on its structure and components:\n\n• Role Definition & Task/Goal:  \n – The prompt starts by clearly defining the role (SuperPrompter GPT) and the task: creating a high-quality, actionable GPT prompt based entirely on the context provided by the book file.  \n\n• Input Specification:  \n – The prompt specifies exactly what kind of input is needed. In this case, the input is the role description and the task/goal provided by the user, alongside the PDF file's content.\n\n• Descriptive Context:  \n – It emphasizes that the prompt should include a descriptive context derived directly from the file. This ensures that the actionable prompt is closely related to the subject matter of the book.  \n – The blueprint mandates elaboration on crucial concepts from the file, thereby increasing the relevance and clarity of the final prompt.\n\n• Rules to Accomplish the Task:  \n – The prompt instructs that any specific rules or constraints (such as input format, procedural guidelines, etc.) mentioned in the file should be adhered to.  \n – This helps in filtering out irrelevant information and ensures that the output is precise and aligned with the provided material.\n\n• Step-by-Step Procedure:  \n – It requires laying out a clear, ordered procedure on how to accomplish the task. This is important to maintain logical coherence, making sure each step follows the previous one, which makes the prompt actionable and easy to follow.\n\n• Examples:  \n – If there are any examples in the file, those should be directly incorporated to illustrate exactly how the prompt might look or function.  \n – Including examples solidifies understanding and offers practical insights into applying the instructions.\n\nOverall, this approach encourages a very structured way of generating prompts from existing materials. It focuses on creating clarity by having a well-defined input, context, rules, and procedure. The system is designed to extract critical details from the uploaded file to inform the prompt creation process, ensuring that the final prompt is not only actionable but also rooted in the underlying material.\n\nIn summary, my take is that this method is a systematic and efficient way to bridge the gap between static textual content (like that in a book) and dynamic, goal-oriented interactions with GPT. It can be particularly useful in contexts where you need to rapidly generate prompts that are deeply connected to a comprehensive source, ensuring that important concepts aren’t overlooked.",

          "response": "This is an excellent approach, especially considering the growing trend of transforming comprehensive textual content into actionable, structured prompts. Here's my take on the \"Book to Prompt\" GPT approach you've outlined:\n\n### Strengths:\n\n1. **Clear Workflow:**  \n   The proposed workflow—upload the PDF, define a goal, and then create prompts—is straightforward and user-friendly. It significantly reduces complexity, making it easy for users to engage.\n\n2. **Context-Driven:**  \n   You clearly emphasize the importance of using the context from the uploaded book. This ensures the prompts will remain faithful to the original content and purpose of the source material.\n\n3. **Structured Prompt Generation:**  \n   By explicitly outlining elements like \"clearly defined input,\" \"descriptive context,\" \"rules,\" and \"step-by-step procedure,\" you're creating a standardized, repeatable method. This makes the prompts consistently useful and actionable.\n\n4. **Concept Highlighting and Explanation:**  \n   The instruction to highlight and clearly explain crucial concepts ensures the generated prompts are not generic but deeply relevant and informative.\n\n5. **Example Provision:**  \n   Including examples from the uploaded file significantly improves clarity and usability. It provides concrete guidance and reduces ambiguity.\n\n---\n\n### Recommendations to Enhance Your Approach:\n\n1. **Quality Control on Uploaded PDFs:**  \n   Implement guidance or suggestions for users on how to select and prepare quality PDFs. Clarifying that clearly formatted, high-quality books yield better prompts would enhance the entire process.\n\n2. **User Guidance for Goal Definition:**  \n   Offer examples of effective \"goal definitions\" to help users clearly articulate their objectives. A good goal definition significantly improves the quality and relevance of the final prompts.\n\n3. **Prompt Validation Protocol:**  \n   Include an optional step for the user to verify or refine the generated prompt before finalizing, ensuring the result is perfectly aligned with their needs.\n\n4. **Domain-Specific Customization:**  \n   Allow users to specify their domain or industry explicitly. It would help the model better tailor prompts to particular use-cases, enhancing relevance and effectiveness.\n\n---\n\n### Example Scenario:\n\n- **Uploaded PDF:** \"Atomic Habits\" by James Clear (hypothetically)\n- **User Goal:** \"Create actionable prompts for building better daily habits.\"\n\nA resulting prompt template could look like this:\n\n### Example Prompt Structure:\n\n**Role:** Habit-building Coach GPT\n\n**Task/Goal:**  \nGenerate personalized, actionable habit-building advice based on methods and insights from \"Atomic Habits.\"\n\n**Clearly defined input:**  \n- Desired habit to build or break  \n- User's current struggles or barriers  \n- Preferred habit-building timeline or duration  \n\n**Descriptive context:**  \n\"Atomic Habits\" emphasizes incremental improvement, habit stacking, environmental design, and identity-based habits. It highlights the importance of making habits obvious, attractive, easy, and satisfying.\n\n**Important Concepts Explained:**\n- **Habit Stacking:** Pairing a new habit with an existing one, creating a clear and simple cue for the new behavior.\n- **Environmental Design:** Adjusting your physical and social environment to encourage desired habits and discourage undesired habits.\n- **Identity-based habits:** Focusing on becoming the type of person who embodies the habit, rather than solely focusing on the outcome.\n\n**Rules:**\n- Always relate advice directly to Atomic Habits' core principles.\n- Keep recommendations practical, concise, and easy to implement.\n- Provide specific examples from the book whenever possible.\n\n**Step-by-step procedure:**\n1. Clearly identify the user's desired habit and current obstacles.\n2. Align the user's scenario with relevant habit-building concepts from Atomic Habits.\n3. Present a well-structured, easily applicable action plan based on these concepts.\n4. Provide clear examples from Atomic Habits to illustrate how these concepts have successfully worked for others.\n\n**Example:**\n- User Input: \"I want to build a habit of reading every night, but struggle with distractions.\"\n- Output:\n  - Apply **Environment Design**: \"Place your book on your pillow each morning, removing phones and tablets from your nightstand.\"\n  - Use **Habit Stacking**: \"After brushing your teeth, immediately sit down with your book for 10 minutes, linking reading to an existing routine.\"\n  - Adopt **Identity-based Habits**: \"Develop the identity of 'becoming a reader' by tracking your reading streak, reinforcing your new identity daily.\"\n\n---\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nYour \"Book to Prompt\" concept is robust, user-friendly, and deeply practical. By implementing minor refinements—such as clearer guidelines for input preparation and goal definition, adding optional validation steps, and customizing prompt generation per domain—you'll further elevate its effectiveness and value.",

          "response": "Below is an example of a fully structured Super GPT prompt that you can use once you provide your specific role and task/goal details. This structure has been derived directly from the instructions in the file \"Book to Prompt: Turn Any Book into Actionable Prompts\" by Lucas C Pimentel and is designed to convert the context of a book (provided as a PDF) into an actionable prompt.\n\n──────────────────────────────\nSuper GPT Prompt Structure\n\n1. Role and Task/Goal Declaration  \n   • Start by clearly defining the role that the user will adopt (for example, “Security Consultant”) and the specific task/goal you want to accomplish.  \n   Example:  \n   \"You are a Security Consultant responsible for analyzing and extracting actionable insights from technical books.\"\n\n──────────────────────────────\n2. Clearly Defined Input  \n   • Specify the exact type of input required by the prompt.  \n   • In this case, it is the PDF of a book.  \n   Example:  \n   \"Input: A PDF file of a book containing technical or security content.\"\n\n──────────────────────────────\n3. Descriptive Context  \n   • Provide a succinct but complete description of the task/goal by referring to details mentioned in the file.  \n   • Emphasize that the aim is to turn the content of the book into a prompt that can drive actionable steps or decisions.  \n   Example:  \n   \"Context: Convert the core concepts and actionable insights from the uploaded book into a structured prompt that outlines clear and precise steps, rules, and processes relevant to security consulting tasks. The source content should inform the prompt by highlighting crucial concepts and procedural guidelines.\"\n\n──────────────────────────────\n4. Rules to Accomplish the Task  \n   • Define any constraints or procedural guidelines that must be followed.  \n   • These might include specifics on how the input should be processed, any formatting constraints, or security considerations when handling the PDF.  \n   Example:  \n   \"Rules:  \n     a. Analyze only content within the PDF.  \n     b. Ensure that all key and actionable concepts in the book are highlighted and explained.  \n     c. The input must strictly be a PDF file – no other formats will be accepted.\n     d. Follow a logical flow that builds from defining the context to elaborating on actionable steps.\"\n\n──────────────────────────────\n5. Step-by-Step Procedure to Accomplish the Task  \n   • Lay out a clear, ordered procedure for processing the input and generating the actionable prompt.  \n   Example:  \n   \"Procedure:  \n     Step 1: Upload the PDF of the book.  \n     Step 2: Define and state your goal or specific actionable outcome from the prompt.  \n     Step 3: Extract and list crucial concepts from the book.  \n     Step 4: Create rules and constraints based solely on the content in the PDF.  \n     Step 5: Assemble the final prompt, ensuring that it includes a clearly defined input, descriptive context, rules, and a logical sequence of steps.\"\n\n──────────────────────────────\n6. Examples (if available in the source file)  \n   • Provide specific examples or sample outputs if the file includes them.  \n   Example:  \n   \"Example:  \n     If the book covers incident response in cybersecurity, the generated prompt might include:  \n     - A designated procedure for reporting and mitigating security breaches.  \n     - A set of rules for verifying incident authenticity.  \n     - Step-by-step actions from detection, analysis, to resolution based on the book’s guidelines.\"\n\n──────────────────────────────\nImportant Concepts Highlighted  \n   • Input Specification: Ensures clarity on what file is to be used (PDF only in this context).  \n   • Context Derivation: Ties the essence of the book’s content directly to the task goal, ensuring that all actionable items are firmly based on the source material.  \n   • Procedural Clarity: Outlines a method-forward approach that minimizes ambiguity and streamlines the conversion of book content into an actionable prompt.  \n   • Rule Enforcements: Maintains the boundaries of the task to guarantee that only relevant content and procedures are considered.\n\n──────────────────────────────\nFinal Note  \nUse this Super GPT prompt structure as a template. When you provide the specific role and task/goal, simply plug in the details accordingly. This will allow you (or anyone in a similar security consulting role) to generate precise, actionable insights derived straight from the source book PDF.\n\n──────────────────────────────\n\nPlease let me know if you would like to adjust any sections, or if you’re ready to provide your role and task/goal details, and we can further tailor this prompt to your specific needs.",

Receive Role & Task/Goal\nYou will tell me:\n- The role (e.g., \"You are a disaster response coordinator\")\n- The goal/task (e.g., \"Create an actionable checklist for earthquake evacuation based on the book content\")\n\n---\n\n### 2. Format the Super GPT Prompt\n\n**Super GPT Prompt**\n\n#### Role:\n[As specified by user: e.g., \"You are a disaster response coordinator.\"]\n\n#### Task/Goal:\n[As specified by user: e.g., \"Create an actionable checklist for earthquake evacuation based on the book content.\"]\n\n---\n\n#### Input (Clearly Defined Input):\nSpecify exactly what is needed from the user to accomplish the goal.  \n**Example:** \"User provides a description of their current location and available resources.\"\n\n---\n\n#### Descriptive Context:\n- Summarize directly from the file the relevant background/information pertaining to the goal.\n- Highlight crucial concepts closely tied to the task.\n- ONLY refer to information present in the uploaded file/PDF.\n\n**Example:**  \n\"The book outlines the following crucial earthquake safety principles: evacuation timing, safe locations, emergency supply management, and communication strategies. It emphasizes the importance of pre-planning and role assignment in high-stress situations. The book defines a 'safe zone' as any structurally sound open space, away from falling hazards.\"\n\n---\n\n#### Rules to Accomplish the Task:\nEnumerate specific rules or constraints, derived from the book, for completing the task.\n\n**Example:**  \n1. Only include supplies listed in the book's emergency kit section.  \n2. Evacuation routes must avoid areas identified as high-risk in the book's hazard maps.  \n3. Communication protocols must follow the book’s chain-of-command guidelines.\n\n---\n\n#### Step-by-Step Procedure:\nProvide a clear, logical sequence of actions, referencing the book for each step.\n\n**Example:**  \n1. Identify your current position and nearest exits (see Ch. 3, 'Safe Movement').  \n2. Gather supplies listed on p. 45, 'Emergency Supplies Checklist.'  \n3. Assign roles based on Ch. 4, 'Disaster Team Organization.'  \n4. Move to the designated safe zone (refer to p. 52, 'Safe Zones').  \n5. Initiate communication protocol as specified on p. 60.\n\n---\n\n#### Examples (If Available in the Book):\nOffer examples directly from the book to illustrate proper execution.\n\n**Example:**  \n\"Case Study: The Smith Family’s Earthquake Drill (p. 78) — Step-by-step actions leading to successful evacuation.\"\n\n---\n\n## What I Need From You:\n\n- Upload or provide the PDF/book file.\n- Tell me the role and the goal/task you want to accomplish.\n\n## What Happens Next:\n\nOnce you provide the PDF/book and your specific role/task, I will:\n\n- Read and analyze the relevant parts of your file.\n- Build a precise Super GPT prompt according to your template, following your rules:\n    - Only reference and discuss content found in the file.\n    - Highlight and explain important, relevant concepts.\n    - Be precisely descriptive and actionable.\n\n---\n\n## Why This Could Prevent a Catastrophe:\nBy extracting accurate, actionable prompts directly from expert sources (your uploaded book), you get:\n- Reliable, context-aware instructions tailored to your real-world goal.\n- Clear, stepwise guidance that minimizes the risk of oversight or error during emergencies.\n- Prompts backed by authoritative information, reducing misinformation or guesswork.\n\n---\n\n**Ready when you are!**  \nPlease upload your PDF/book and specify the role and the actionable goal you want to achieve. I’ll follow this process and generate your Super GPT prompt accordingly.",

Since you haven’t provided the file yet, this template outlines the structure and steps you will follow after you upload the book and specify your goal. You can adapt or refine these steps based on the content of the file and the specific objectives you have. \n\n──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nROLE & GOAL\n──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n• Role: “SuperPrompter GPT”  \n• Goal: To transform the provided PDF (book or text) into a tailored prompt that achieves a specific objective.  \n\nOnce you have shared:\n1. The PDF content (the book or reference material).  \n2. Your specific task or goal (what you want to do with the book’s content).  \n\nThen you will work through the following outline:\n\n──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n1. CLEARLY DEFINED INPUT\n──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nWrite out the exact type of input that your final prompt will require. For instance:  \n• A user’s query or question about the book contents.  \n• A piece of text to analyze using the book’s methodology.  \n• A scenario described in a few sentences to which the book’s principles must be applied.  \n\nThis section should state precisely what you expect from the end user to feed into the prompt.\n\n──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n2. DESCRIPTIVE CONTEXT\n──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nOnce you have the PDF content, do the following:\n• Summarize the key principles and insights from the book that are most relevant to the goal.  \n• Identify any unique terminology or frameworks in the book that will help clarify how the goal can be met.  \n• Focus on “why” these principles matter (to bridge the book’s concepts with the user’s objective).  \n\nOnly refer to and elaborate on information that actually appears in the provided text. Highlight the important or specialized concepts that will enhance the prompt’s effectiveness.\n\n──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n3. RULES TO ACCOMPLISH THE TASK\n──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nList the constraints, instructions, or procedural guidelines from the book that are essential to fulfilling the user’s goal. For example:  \n• Specific steps, formulas, or protocols mentioned in the text.  \n• Limitations or caveats on how to use the book’s information.  \n• Ethical, safety, or best-practice guidelines laid out in the content.  \n\nEnsure these rules are explicitly based on what the book states, rather than assumptions or external sources.\n\n──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n4. STEP-BY-STEP PROCEDURE TO ACCOMPLISH THE TASK\n──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nOutline a numbered sequence of actions the user (or you, as the system) should take to complete the objective, grounded in the PDF’s material. For example:\n1. Extract the relevant section or chapter from the book.  \n2. Interpret the author’s framework or method in the context of the user’s goal.  \n3. Apply each principle to the user’s query/scenario.  \n4. Verify consistency with any provided rules or constraints from the text.  \n5. Present the outcome or solution, referencing how it aligns with the book’s guidance.\n\nGive as many distinct steps as needed to make the procedure unambiguous.\n\n──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n5. EXAMPLES (IF AVAILABLE)\n──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nIf the PDF provides examples or case studies relevant to your goal, include them here. Cite them to demonstrate explicitly how the book addresses situations similar to the user’s task or goal. Also:\n• Show how the example flows through each of the steps above.  \n• Illustrate how the rules apply within that example.  \n• Emphasize any unique terminology from the book that appears in that example.\n\n──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nHOW TO USE THIS FRAMEWORK\n──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n1. Upload or provide the PDF (the book) to your environment (e.g., your conversational interface, system, or any text processing tool).  \n2. Identify your goal: specify precisely what you want to do with the book’s content (e.g., summarization, solution proposal, creative writing, risk assessment, etc.).  \n3. Follow the sections above (1 through 5), extracting all information strictly from the PDF to populate each part.  \n4. Once you have compiled every section, test your final prompt by giving it an input (per section 1) and evaluating if the output meets your objective.  \n5. Adjust wording and structure as needed to ensure clarity and correctness.\n\n──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nFINAL NOTE\n──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nBy adhering to these steps, you ensure your “Super GPT prompt” remains tightly grounded in the actual text. Focus on pulling out the book’s methodologies, examples, and guidelines to form a robust prompt that can handle the complexity of the task you have in mind.\n\nWhen you have the PDF and have defined your goal, feel free to share the relevant excerpts or summaries. Then we can collaborate to craft each section of that structured prompt in detail.",

          "response": "Absolutely! Here’s how I would approach your request, step by step, using the SuperPrompter GPT method and the Book to Prompt guidelines. Since I don’t have the actual PDF uploaded or its content, I’ll show you a template based on your instructions, so you can easily adapt it when you have the file ready. This is a generalized framework; once you upload your specific book or file, I can fill in the details from its content.\n\n---\n\n# SuperPrompter GPT Prompt Creation Framework\n\n## 1. Role and Task/Goal\n\n**Role:**  \nYou are an IT security professional.\n\n**Task/Goal:**  \nDocument and demonstrate our organization’s protections against the misuse or unauthorized use of AI tools that convert books into actionable prompts, ensuring compliance with data privacy and intellectual property standards.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Clearly Defined Input\n\n**Input Needed:**  \n- The full text (PDF, excerpt, or chapter) of the book or document to be protected  \n- The organization’s security policies  \n- The specific AI tool or workflow in question\n\n---\n\n## 3. Descriptive Context\n\n**Context:**  \nAI tools like \"Book to Prompt\" can transform entire books into actionable prompts, making it easier to extract and operationalize information. While this is powerful, it also raises concerns about data leakage, unauthorized distribution of intellectual property, and compliance with privacy regulations.\n\n**Crucial Concepts:**  \n- **Prompt Engineering:** The process of designing and structuring inputs to AI models for optimal, actionable output.  \n- **Data Privacy:** Ensuring that uploaded documents do not contain sensitive or personally identifiable information that could be exposed.  \n- **Intellectual Property Protection:** Safeguarding copyright materials from unauthorized redistribution or repurposing.  \n- **Access Control:** Restricting which users or systems can interact with the AI tool or the outputs it generates.  \n- **Audit Trails:** Maintaining logs of who accessed or uploaded what, and when.  \n- **Redaction:** Removing or masking sensitive information prior to uploading documents to AI tools.\n\n---\n\n## 4. Rules to Accomplish the Task\n\n- Only designated, authenticated users can upload books or documents to AI tools.\n- All sensitive or confidential information must be redacted before uploading.\n- Outputs generated must not be distributed outside the organization without review and approval.\n- Maintain an audit log for all uploads and prompt generations.\n- Regularly review and update protection policies based on emerging threats and tool capabilities.\n- Ensure compliance with copyright and data privacy laws.\n\n---\n\n## 5. Step-by-Step Procedure to Accomplish the Task\n\n1. **User Authentication:** Require all users to authenticate before accessing the AI tool.\n2. **Pre-Upload Screening:**  \n a. Review documents for sensitive or confidential information.  \n b. Redact or anonymize any such data as per policy.\n3. **Upload & Logging:**  \n a. Upload the redacted file to the AI tool.  \n b. Log the upload event (user, time, file name, purpose).\n4. **Prompt Generation:** Use the AI tool to generate actionable prompts.\n5. **Output Review:**  \n a. Review generated prompts for unintended information disclosure.  \n b. Approve or reject for further use.\n6. **Distribution Controls:**  \n a. Only distribute approved prompts within the organization.  \n b. External sharing requires additional approval.\n7. **Audit & Compliance:**  \n a. Regularly review logs and processes for compliance.  \n b. Update policies as needed.\n\n---\n\n## 6. Examples (from file, if available)\n\n*(Since the file isn’t provided, placeholders are used. Replace with actual examples from your file.)*\n\n- **Example 1:**  \nInput: Uploaded \"Confidential Strategy.pdf\" (post-redaction)  \nPrompt Generated: \"Summarize the main business strategies in actionable steps for the sales team.\"  \nReview Outcome: Approved for internal use.\n\n- **Example 2:**  \nInput: Uploaded \"Client Data Report.pdf\" (w/o redaction)  \nPrompt Generated: \"List all client contact information for outreach.\"  \nReview Outcome: Rejected – contained unredacted PII.\n\n---\n\n## Template Usage\n\nOnce you upload the actual PDF or provide more specific content, I can:\n\n- Extract key concepts, terminology, and examples directly from the file.\n- Refine the context and procedural steps based on the book’s or tool’s specific workflow.\n- Populate the examples section with real cases from the document.\n\n---\n\n**Let me know when you’re ready to upload your PDF or provide the content, and I’ll tailor this template to your exact needs, strictly following the Book to Prompt and SuperPrompter GPT methodology!**",

This prompt is constructed following the methodology defined in the file (i.e. the instructions for turning any book into actionable prompts) while tailoring the content to your IT security context.\n\n──────────────────────────────\nSuper GPT Prompt: Documenting IT Security Protections for Book-to-Prompt\n\nRole: IT Security Documentation Specialist  \nTask/Goal: Create a detailed document that explains the protective measures we have implemented against risks associated with the Book-to-Prompt system. This includes controls around file uploads, access to sensitive content, and ensuring that the conversion process abides by our security policies.\n\n1. Clearly Defined Input  \n• Input Type: A PDF file (or similar documentation) that outlines our internal IT security measures and the configuration of protections specific to file uploads and data processing in the Book-to-Prompt system.\n\n2. Descriptive Context  \n• Context Description:  \n – The Book-to-Prompt method, as described by Lucas C Pimentel, involves two primary steps: (1) uploading a PDF of a book and (2) converting the user’s stated goal into an actionable prompt.  \n – In our environment, we have repurposed this mechanism. Instead of processing any arbitrary book, our adapted system must verify that uploaded documents do not contain sensitive or unapproved content.  \n – This document should articulate the rationale behind each control, emphasizing how the process is modified to incorporate security features such as file validation, content filtering, and strict access controls.\n  \n• Key Concepts to Include:  \n – PDF Upload Verification: Ensure that only sanctioned types of documents are accepted.  \n – Content Scanning & Sanitization: Describe how the system inspects uploaded files to detect and block sensitive information.  \n – Role-based Access: Clarify that only authorized personnel can trigger or see the conversion outputs.  \n – Audit Logging: Explain how every action (upload, conversion, user query) is recorded for future audits and incident investigations.  \n – Procedural Enforcement: Outline the chain of validation that prevents data leakage during the conversion process.\n\n3. Rules to Accomplish the Task  \n• Only work with authorized documents and inputs approved for processing.  \n• Enforce strict validation rules to confirm that the PDF does not include classified or sensitive internal data.  \n• Follow the exact sequence of content validation, sanitization, and secure conversion as defined in our internal procedures.  \n• Do not process files that have not been cleared by the security review board.  \n• Log every interaction with the system for accountability and compliance.\n\n4. Step-by-Step Procedure to Accomplish the Task  \nStep 1: Input Verification  \n – Verify user authentication and check that the user has the necessary clearance.  \n – Validate the PDF’s format and ensure it originates from an approved source.\n\nStep 2: Content Scanning and Filtering  \n – Run the PDF through automated content scanning tools to detect any sensitive or disallowed data.  \n – If disallowed content is identified, terminate the conversion process and notify the appropriate security personnel.\n\nStep 3: Controlled Conversion Process  \n – Only upon successful clearance should the system process the file to convert the user’s stated goal into an actionable prompt.  \n – Ensure that while constructing the prompt, no data from the PDF leaks unauthorized context.\n\nStep 4: Audit and Logging  \n – Record every step from file upload to prompt generation with timestamps, user IDs, and process outcomes.  \n – Maintain logs for monitoring and post-incident reviews.\n\n5. Examples  \nExample 1:  \n • Scenario: An authorized user uploads a public-domain book intended for conversion.  \n • Process:  \n  – The system verifies the document’s metadata.  \n  – The content scan confirms that no sensitive information is present.  \n  – The file is processed per the defined procedure, and an actionable prompt is generated.  \n  – All steps are logged.\n\nExample 2:  \n • Scenario: A user attempts to upload a document containing excerpts from internal reports.  \n • Process:  \n  – The file upload is flagged by a content scanning tool.  \n  – The system halts further processing and alerts the IT security team.  \n  – The prompt conversion does not occur, thereby preventing potential data leakage.\n\n──────────────────────────────\nImportant Concepts Explained:  \n• “PDF Upload Verification” ensures that any file entering the system is vetted and comes from trusted sources.  \n• “Content Scanning & Sanitization” is the security gate that protects against exposing sensitive or classified information through the conversion mechanism.  \n• “Role-based Access” and “Audit Logging” provide accountability by ensuring that only authorized individuals can interact with or view particular data, and that every action is tracked.  \n• Following a logical, step-by-step protocol guarantees that security policies are effectively enforced at every stage of the input-to-output process.\n\nBy using this Super GPT prompt as the template for your documentation, you can clearly articulate how our IT security measures address the unique challenges posed by a system that converts uploaded documents (books) into actionable prompts.",

Essentially, it helps you extract practical, goal-oriented insights or instructions directly from the content of a book.\n\n**How does it work?**\n1. **Upload the PDF of a book.**\n2. **Tell the GPT your goal or the outcome you want.**\n3. The tool processes the file and your goal. It then generates a detailed Super GPT prompt based on the book’s content and your objective.\n\n---\n\n### Prompt Construction Framework (SuperPrompter GPT)\n\nWhen you use Book to Prompt, it constructs a Super GPT prompt using the following structure:\n\n#### 1. Clearly Defined Input\n- **Purpose:** Specify exactly what kind of input the prompt expects (e.g., a question, a summary request, an action plan).\n- **Example:** “Input: A specific learning goal, such as ‘learn how to speed-read.’”\n\n#### 2. Descriptive Context\n- **Purpose:** The prompt includes a summary of relevant information from the book related to your goal.\n- **Key Concepts:** Extracts and highlights major ideas, methods, frameworks, or definitions from the book that are crucial for your task.\n- **Example:** “Context: The book discusses speed-reading techniques, including skimming, scanning, and comprehension checks.”\n\n#### 3. Rules to Accomplish the Task\n- **Purpose:** Sets boundaries or guidelines for how the task should be performed, based strictly on the book’s content.\n- **Example:** “Rules: Only use methods described in the book. Exclude any external resources or advice.”\n\n#### 4. Step-by-step Procedure to Accomplish the Task\n- **Purpose:** Outlines a logical, ordered approach, broken into clear steps, using only the procedures or advice found in the book.\n- **Example:**  \n  1. Identify the purpose of your reading.\n  2. Preview the chapter headings and summaries.\n  3. Apply the SQ3R method as detailed in Chapter 2.\n\n#### 5. Examples (from the Book)\n- **Purpose:** If the book includes examples, the prompt will provide relevant ones to illustrate the procedure or key concepts.\n- **Example:** “Example: The author demonstrates speed-reading by summarizing a 10-page chapter in 5 minutes using outlined techniques.”\n\n---\n\n### Important Concepts Highlighted\n\n- **Actionable Prompts:** The output is not just a summary, but a ready-to-use prompt tailored to your specific goal with clear instructions derived from the book.\n- **Goal-Oriented:** The process always starts with your intended outcome, ensuring the prompt is relevant and practical.\n- **Strictly Book-Based:** Only uses information found in the uploaded book—no outside information is introduced.\n- **Structured Output:** The generated prompts follow a systematic structure, improving clarity and usability.\n\n---\n\n### Example Use Case\n\nSuppose you upload a book on productivity and your goal is “to create a daily routine based on the book’s advice.”  \nBook to Prompt will generate a prompt that:\n- Specifies “Input: A desired daily productivity outcome.”\n- Summarizes the book’s main productivity frameworks.\n- Lists rules (e.g., “Only use time-blocking and prioritization methods from the book.”)\n- Gives a stepwise routine-building procedure.\n- Provides an example routine if the book contains one.\n\n---\n\n### How to Use\n\n1. Go to https://chat.openai.com/g/g-h4gjGg7a0-book-to-prompt.\n2. Upload your book in PDF format.\n3. State your goal (e.g., “Create a study guide for chapter 3.”)\n4.

Upload the PDF of a book.\n2. State your goal or the task you want to achieve using insights from the book.\n3. SuperPrompter GPT will generate a comprehensive prompt for your goal, based strictly on the content of the uploaded file.\n\nPrompt Framework:\n\nAfter you submit your role and goal/task, SuperPrompter GPT will append the following structured sections to the prompt:\n\n- Clearly defined input:\n  Specify exactly what input the model needs (based on the book’s context). This ensures the prompt is focused and actionable.\n\n- Descriptive context:\n  Provide a relevant, concise summary of the goal/task, explicitly referencing key passages, theories, or methods from the book.\n  Highlight and explain crucial concepts, frameworks, or terms from the book that are essential for understanding and accomplishing the goal/task.\n\n- Rules to accomplish the task:\n  List any specific rules, constraints, or procedural guidelines derived from the book.\n  These may include input formatting, ethical considerations, or steps to follow, as outlined in the book.\n\n- Step-by-step procedure to accomplish the task:\n  Break down the task into a logical sequence of steps, using the methodologies or processes described in the book.\n  Each step should be clear, actionable, and informed by the source material.\n\n- Examples (if available):\n  Provide examples from the book that illustrate how the task can be accomplished, or that demonstrate key concepts.\n\nImplementation Rules:\n\n- Only use information found in the uploaded file.\n- Always highlight and explain important concepts that provide better context to the prompt.\n- Be precisely descriptive, but do not include information or assumptions not present in the book.\n\nSample Implementation Flow:\n\n1. User uploads a book (PDF).\n2. User provides their role and the goal/task they want to achieve.\n3. SuperPrompter GPT analyzes the file for relevant sections, concepts, and examples.\n4. SuperPrompter GPT generates a structured prompt using the above framework, including any examples from the file.\n5. The output is a high-quality, context-driven prompt ready to be used for advanced tasks or automation.\n\nExample (Illustrative):\n\nSuppose you upload \"Atomic Habits\" by James Clear and your goal is: \"Create a prompt that helps someone build a new daily writing habit.\"\n\nSuperPrompter GPT would produce:\n\n- Clearly defined input: The user’s desired habit and context (e.g., 'writing 300 words daily').\n- Descriptive context: Summarizes the book’s approach to habit formation, e.g., cue-routine-reward, environment design, identity-based habits.\n- Rules: Start small, make it obvious, track progress (according to book’s principles).\n- Step-by-step procedure: Break into cue identification, habit stacking, environmental tweaks, etc.\n- Examples: Illustrative sample routines or habit trackers from the book.\n\n---\n\nThis ensures every prompt generated is actionable, contextually rich, and grounded in the actual content of the uploaded book, maximizing outcome relevance and quality.\n\nLet me know if you’d like a template or code representation for integration!",

          "response": "Below is an explanation of how the \"Book to Prompt\" concept works and the clear structure you should follow when creating a new Super GPT prompt based on a book’s content:\n\n──────────────────────────────\nOverview:\n──────────────────────────────\nThe idea is to transform any PDF book into an actionable prompt for a Super GPT. You begin by uploading the PDF of a book and then specifying a role along with a goal/task that you want your resulting prompt to address. \n\nYour assistant (SuperPrompter GPT) will then craft the detailed prompt by appending the following components:\n\n──────────────────────────────\n1. Clearly Defined Input:\n──────────────────────────────\n• Define the exact type of input needed.\n  – For example: \"Please provide your target text, dataset, or description relevant to the task.\"\n  \nThis ensures that the user knows specifically what kind of information is required for the prompt to operate as intended.\n\n──────────────────────────────\n2. Descriptive Context:\n──────────────────────────────\n• Provide a relevant description of the goal/task derived from the book's context.\n• Highlight key concepts and background derived solely from the content of the PDF.\n  – For example: if the book covers \"strategies for effective learning,\" you might note that “the core concept is to enhance information retention by utilizing spaced repetition methods.”\n  \nThe context helps ground the prompt in the themes and insights from the book.\n\n──────────────────────────────\n3. Rules to Accomplish the Task:\n──────────────────────────────\n• Enumerate any specific rules or constraints necessary for the task.\n  – This might include format requirements for input/output, length restrictions, or procedural guidelines.\n  – For example: \"The summary must be no longer than 200 words,\" or \"Data inputs must be structured as a JSON object.\"\n\nClear rules ensure that the generated output aligns with the intended goals and respects any limitations inherent to the book’s content.\n\n──────────────────────────────\n4. Step-by-Step Procedure to Accomplish the Task:\n──────────────────────────────\n• Detail an ordered sequence of steps that logically build on each other.\n  – Sample steps might include: \n     a. Read the provided context or dataset.\n     b. Identify central themes and relevant details.\n     c. Outline the main points in a structured manner.\n     d. Formulate the final output based on the guidelines.\n     \nA step-by-step process gives a clear roadmap that makes it easy for the user (or the system) to understand how to proceed from start to finish.\n\n──────────────────────────────\n5. Examples:\n──────────────────────────────\n• Incorporate clear examples if available in the book.\n  – For instance: \"If the book includes a chapter on time management with a highlighted method described as 'Pomodoro Technique,' mention how periodic breaks are integrated into your planning.\"\n  \nExamples provide clarity and further detail, anchoring the abstract instructions to concrete real-world usage similar to what is found in the book.\n\n──────────────────────────────\nSummary of the Prompt Instruction:\n──────────────────────────────\nWhen you provide me with your role and overall goal/task (as derived from the book) I will generate a Super GPT prompt that contains:\n\n1. A clearly defined input description.\n2. Descriptive context explaining the goal/task based solely on information from the uploaded PDF.\n3. A detailed list of any rules or constraints that need to be followed.\n4. A logical, step-by-step procedure outlining how to achieve the specified task.\n5. Examples, if available, to illustrate the concepts and ensure clarity.\n\n──────────────────────────────\nUsage Note:\n──────────────────────────────\nRemember: I must work strictly using the context provided within the file. I will highlight and explain important concepts only as they appear in that file. This ensures precision and relevance in the prompt creation.\n\n──────────────────────────────\nConclusion:\n──────────────────────────────\nThis structured approach transforms any book into an actionable prompt, facilitating clear, guided interactions that make full use of the insights contained in the book. Simply upload the PDF and supply your desired role plus task/goal, and I (SuperPrompter GPT) will build your customized Super GPT prompt following the detailed structure outlined above.",

Note that this is essentially a transformation or synthesis process rather than a typical decision problem (one that asks a yes/no question).

Checking for a clearly defined input is simply a matter of scanning the candidate text to see if it meets the expected structure.\n2. Verifying the descriptive context means looking for key phrases or descriptions that match the content given by the file.\n3. Evaluating that the prescribed rules, procedures, and examples are all present is again a process of pattern‐matching and string search.\n  \nEach of these checks can be done by a deterministic algorithm that runs in time polynomial in the size of the input (the candidate prompt and file content). In other words, given a candidate answer, verifying that it meets all the outlined requirements is computationally feasible within polynomial time.\n\nThus, when the task is recast as a decision problem—“Does this candidate prompt obey all the necessary criteria?”—the verification can be carried out in polynomial time. This means that the decision problem, in its yes/no form, is in class P.\n\nIt is important to note, however, that the original description is a creative prompt-generation process, not a classic decision problem.

The prompt must directly fulfill this goal.\n\n---\n\n## Step 3: Complexity Analysis:\n\n### a) Is this problem in class P?  \nTo belong to class P, we must identify if a deterministic algorithm can reliably produce an answer (\"Yes, an actionable prompt exists\" or \"No, it does not\") in polynomial time. The challenge here is that producing high-quality, contextually relevant prompts from arbitrary texts (books) is inherently subjective and generally requires natural language understanding, semantic interpretation, and creative synthesis. These tasks are typically not known to be efficiently solvable by deterministic polynomial-time algorithms due to ambiguity, complexity, and the open-ended nature of language and human intent.\n\nThus, **the problem as described does not clearly lend itself to a known polynomial-time deterministic algorithm** for all inputs.\n\n### b) Is this problem in class NP?  \nTo belong to NP, the decision problem must have efficiently verifiable solutions. Suppose someone proposes a candidate prompt for a given book and goal. Can we efficiently verify the correctness or validity of this prompt given the original book and goal?\n\n- A verifier could quickly (in polynomial time) check if a candidate prompt clearly matches the explicitly stated goal (assuming the goal is clearly and explicitly defined).\n- Verifying correctness means checking if the prompt accurately uses information from the book, aligns closely with the specified goal, and is logically consistent. A human or advanced language model could quickly verify if the prompt is a good match or not—implying verification likely is feasible in polynomial time.\n- Thus, it is reasonable to consider this problem in NP, since verifying a given solution (prompt) can be done quickly once the solution candidate is provided.\n\n---\n\n## Step 4: Conclusions Based on Complexity Analysis:\n\n- **Class P**: Unlikely, because prompt generation from general book content and ambiguous human goals is complex, subjective, and requires semantic interpretation, creative inference, and synthesis—tasks generally not known to have efficient deterministic algorithms.\n  \n- **Class NP**: Likely, because verifying whether a provided prompt fulfills the clearly stated goal given the book is relatively straightforward and can be done efficiently.\n\n---\n\n## Final Answer:\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe described decision problem \"Book to Prompt\" is most reasonably classified as belonging to class **NP**. It is unlikely to belong to **P**, as there is currently no known deterministic polynomial-time algorithm capable of reliably generating actionable prompts from arbitrary books and arbitrary user-defined goals. However, given a candidate solution (prompt), its appropriateness and validity can be efficiently verified, making the problem a good candidate for class **NP**.",

Read the chapter.\n2. Identify all strategies, tips, or methods mentioned.\n3. Summarize each in a bullet point.\n4. Arrange bullet points in order of appearance.\n\n**Examples:**  \n- “Use the Eisenhower Matrix to distinguish between urgent and important tasks.”  \n- “Apply the Pomodoro Technique: work for 25 minutes, then take a 5-minute break.”\n\n---\n\nLet me know your ROLE and TASK/GOAL, and upload your PDF to get started!",

Since you have not yet provided a specific file, the template includes placeholders for you to fill in once you know the actual contents of the PDF. Adapt each section to reflect the real details, key concepts, constraints, and examples found in your file.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nSUPER GPT PROMPT TEMPLATE\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n1) ROLE AND TASK/GOAL\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n“You are [ROLE / EXPERT identity]. Your goal is to [STATE THE OVERALL GOAL OR TASK].\nAll your responses should be designed to help me accomplish [GOAL / TASK] effectively.”\n\n2) CLEARLY DEFINED INPUT\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n• Specify exactly what the model/assistant should receive from the user.  \n  Example:\n  - “The input is a short summary or excerpt from the PDF.”\n  - “The input is a list of topics derived from the PDF sections.”\n  - “The input is any user question related to the content in the PDF.”\n\n3) DESCRIPTIVE CONTEXT\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n• Provide relevant background, gleaned from the PDF, that will inform how the model should address the task.  \n• Since you have not provided your actual PDF, you might replace the text below with key points from your book.  \n\nExample placeholder context:  \n  - “This PDF/book covers [TOPICS, THEMES, FRAMEWORKS].”\n  - “It emphasizes the importance of [KEY CONCEPT 1], which involves [SHORT EXPLANATION].”\n  - “One of the major takeaways is [KEY CONCEPT 2], focusing on [SHORT EXPLANATION].”\n\n• Highlight and elaborate on crucial concepts in the PDF that are closely related to the task/goal.  \n  Example placeholder notes could include:\n  - “Crucial concept: [Concept Name] – [Brief explanation of how it affects the user’s goal].”\n  - “Crucial concept: [Another Concept Name] – [Brief details or how it integrates with the existing context].”\n\n4) RULES TO ACCOMPLISH THE TASK\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n• Enumerate specific constraints or best practices from the PDF that guide how the user or the model should proceed.  \n• If the PDF details a particular methodology, define relevant rules or constraints from each step of that methodology.  \n  Example placeholders:\n  - “Rule 1: Always reference [Concept/Methodology] from Chapter 3 before making a recommendation.”\n  - “Rule 2: Use the formula in Section 2.1, ensuring data is validated first.”\n\n5) STEP-BY-STEP PROCEDURE TO ACCOMPLISH THE TASK\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n• Lay out a clear, ordered procedure for how to apply the PDF’s guidelines, methods, or insights.  \n• Each step should transparently reference the relevant content or concept from the PDF, if applicable.  \n  Example placeholder steps:\n  1. “Identify the main objective by reviewing points from [Section X].”  \n  2. “Review any relevant constraints in [Section Y or Chapter Y].”  \n  3. “Apply technique [Name/Concept] described in the PDF to address the objective.”  \n  4. “Consolidate the findings and format them for clarity, referencing details from [Chapter Z].”\n\n6) EXAMPLES\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n• Provide one or more examples demonstrating how to use the content from the PDF within this prompt structure.  \n• If your PDF includes case studies or sample scenarios, outline them as mini-examples.  \n\nExample placeholder:\n  - “Example Input: A short excerpt from the PDF about [Topic] plus the user’s main question.”  \n  - “Example Output: Explanation of [Concept], referencing [Chapter] in the PDF, then a suggested application.”\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nADDITIONAL REMINDERS\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n• Make sure you only describe details and concepts that are truly in the PDF.  \n• Whenever you mention or highlight a concept, connect it clearly to its source in the PDF (e.g., the relevant page, chapter, or heading).  \n• If no direct example is found in the PDF, either omit that example or clearly state you are hypothesizing.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nHOW TO USE THIS TEMPLATE\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n1. Replace the placeholder text with real details from your PDF.  \n2. Tailor the “Rules” and “Step-by-Step Procedure” sections so they specifically reflect (and possibly reference) your PDF’s methodology or arguments.  \n3. For each crucial concept in your PDF, provide a short summary or explanation so that the user (or the assistant) fully understands how to apply it.  \n4. Insert real examples from the PDF whenever possible, including any sample data or case studies illustrating how to accomplish the task.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nSAMPLE MINIMAL FILLED-OUT VERSION (WITH MADE-UP DETAILS)\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n“You are a Productivity Coach. Your goal is to help me streamline my morning routine to maximize efficiency and reduce stress.\n\nINPUT NEEDED:\n• A short summary of my current morning routine.  \n• The user’s biggest stress points or issues.  \n\nDESCRIPTIVE CONTEXT:  \n• This PDF, ‘Morning Mastery 101,’ covers motivational strategies, time-blocking, and mindset shifts for an improved morning routine.  \n• Crucial concepts:  \n  - ‘5-Minute Visualization’ (Chapter 2)  \n  - ‘Time-Blocking Strategy’ (Chapter 4)  \n\nRULES TO ACCOMPLISH THE TASK:  \n1. Always start by clarifying the user’s main objective (Chapter 1).  \n2. Apply the ‘Time-Blocking Strategy’ from Chapter 4 to each major morning task.  \n3. Include mindfulness techniques from Chapter 3 if mental or emotional stress is reported.\n\nSTEP-BY-STEP PROCEDURE:  \n1. Ask user for their current morning schedule (Chapter 1: “Identifying Patterns”).  \n2. Pinpoint where stress or inefficiencies arise (Chapter 2 notes on ‘Stressors’).  \n3. Apply time-blocking: segment routine into 15-30 minute blocks (Chapter 4).  \n4. Integrate the ‘5-Minute Visualization’ exercise (Chapter 2).  \n5. Provide a revised schedule and measure success in weekly increments.\n\nEXAMPLES:\n• Example Input: “I wake up at 7 AM but feel rushed to get out by 8 AM. I skip breakfast and forget half of my tasks.”  \n• Example Output: “Try setting your alarm at 6:30 AM and use a 15-minute block for a quick protein breakfast. Insert a 5-minute visualization to mentally rehearse the morning…(etc. referencing details from relevant chapters).”\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nUse this structured approach to guide your Super GPT prompt creation process for any PDF-based content.

          "response": "Below is a Super GPT prompt template that follows your provided instructions. This prompt is designed to convert any book (provided as a PDF file) into a series of actionable prompts by guiding the user step‐by‐step. You can adapt, tweak, and expand this framework as needed.\n\n──────────────────────────────\nSuper GPT Prompt – Book-to-Prompt Converter\n\nContext:  \nYou have a book (provided as a PDF file) whose content you want to transform into a set of actionable, task-focused prompts. Your goal is to extract key themes, concepts, and procedures from the book and ultimately turn them into a clear, structured prompt that can instruct or guide AI or users in a specific domain or task.\n\nInput:  \n• The input required is a PDF file of the book you want to use as a reference.  \n• Additional details include any specific goals or tasks you wish the resulting prompt to achieve. (For example, “transforming a chapter on time management into a detailed guide on productivity”)\n\nDescriptive Context:  \n• The prompt will be built directly around the content of the provided file.  \n• It should capture the core ideas, concepts, themes, and essential rules present in the book.  \n• Specific points from the file – such as crucial guidelines, methodologies, or step-by-step processes – must be translated into clear, actionable instructions.  \n• Consider the underlying structure: define what is expected from the final prompt in relation to the material contained in the text.\n\nKey Concepts to Highlight:  \n1. Input Definition: Clearly state that the PDF file serves as the foundational source of information and indicate what type of details or chapters (e.g., themes, rules, step-by-step guides) the file contains.  \n2. Contextual Information: Explain how the prompt should leverage critical aspects (like methodologies or strategies) derived from the content.  \n3. Procedural Guidelines: Identify the logical flow that the book suggests and ensure that the final prompt includes a coherent, step-by-step procedure for task accomplishment.  \n4. Example Integration: When themes or rules are present in the file, provide illustrative examples that clearly connect the content with the intended task.\n\nRules to Accomplish the Task:  \n• All information provided must be strictly based on the content of the PDF file.  \n• Do not introduce extraneous details outside of what is present in the file.  \n• Follow a clear, deterministic structure: first give an overview of the content, then derive actionable steps, and finally conclude with specific examples where applicable.  \n• Use consistent formatting and clear language to ensure the resulting prompt is user-friendly and easily interpreted.  \n• Ensure that every rule, guideline, and conceptual idea is logically connected to both the book’s content and the final goal.\n\nStep-by-Step Procedure to Create the Super GPT Prompt:\n\nStep 1: Define the Input  \n a. Ask the user to upload the PDF file of the book.  \n b. Request a clear statement of the final goal or task to be achieved with the resulting prompt (e.g., “develop a productivity guide based on the book’s chapter on time management”).\n\nStep 2: Analyze the File’s Content  \n a. Extract and list core themes, ideas, and concepts contained in the file.  \n b. Identify any structured rules, procedures, or example scenarios included in the book.\n c. Note any crucial methodologies that are essential to understanding the task.\n\nStep 3: Structure the Prompt Content  \n a. Start with a brief overview of the book’s context and your goal.  \n b. Clearly define the input: specify that the PDF file is your source of content and outline the type of information expected (e.g., themes, examples, rules).  \n c. Elaborate on the descriptive context by summarizing the book’s key concepts related to the task.\n\nStep 4: Specify the Rules and Constraints  \n a. List any prohibitions (e.g., “do not include content not present in the file”) and constraints regarding how to use the file’s data.  \n b. Provide instructions to follow a logical, step-by-step process ensuring no steps are skipped.\n\nStep 5: Provide Examples as Needed  \n a. If the file includes sample scenarios or illustrative themes, incorporate these as clear examples in the prompt.  \n b. Ensure the examples directly reflect methodologies or concepts mentioned in the book.\n\nStep 6: Finalize and Summarize  \n a. Review the assembled prompt to make sure it is both comprehensive and consistent with the book’s content.  \n b. Offer a summary that encapsulates the overall goal and the logical flow expected from the prompt.  \n c. Confirm that the user’s provided information (the PDF and task details) have been fully integrated into the prompt’s structure.\n\n──────────────────────────────\nUsage Example:  \nImagine you have a book that details advanced strategies for digital marketing. By following the above process, the generated prompt might instruct:  \n “Please provide the PDF of the digital marketing book and specify whether you want to craft a new marketing campaign outline, a content strategy, or a detailed competitor analysis methodology. From the provided content, we will extract marketing strategies, key performance indicators, and clear step-by-step tactics to create an actionable marketing prompt.”\n\n──────────────────────────────\nFinal Note:  \nThis template is specifically structured to ensure that every element of the book’s content is respected and translated into actionable steps, maintaining both clarity and precision. Use this as a starting framework and adjust the particulars based on the unique themes and guidelines present in the input file.\n\nBy following the above structure, you’ll turn any book into an actionable, self-contained prompt that meets your specified goals.",

A PDF file containing the book content.  \n2. A clear statement of the goal or outcome that the prompt should help the user achieve.\n\n─────────────────────────────  \nDESCRIPTIVE CONTEXT  \n─────────────────────────────  \nContext Description:  \nThis configuration, based on the “Book to Prompt” protocol by Lucas C Pimentel, instructs the system to convert book content into actionable prompt instructions. The process involves extracting essential ideas and instructions from the PDF and aligning them with the user’s specific task or goal. Important to note is that the file emphasizes a two-step usage process: first, uploading the PDF book; second, identifying the goal to have that book’s content converted into an effective prompt.  \n\nKey Concepts:  \n– Book Transformation: Converting the in-depth content of a book into a series of actionable instructions.  \n– Actionable Prompt: A well-structured, clear prompt that outlines the necessary steps to achieve the user's goal.  \n– Goal-Driven Content: The extracted concepts are aligned specifically with the user’s defined objective.  \n\n─────────────────────────────  \nRULES TO ACCOMPLISH THE TASK  \n─────────────────────────────  \n1. The input must strictly include a PDF file and a clearly defined goal.  \n2. Only use concepts, steps, and examples that are found in the provided file.  \n3. The output prompt should clearly separate and label each element: input, context, rules, and step-by-step procedure.  \n4. Ensure that all descriptions and explanations are concise yet thorough enough to provide clear guidance for the transformation process.\n\n─────────────────────────────  \nSTEP-BY-STEP PROCEDURE TO ACCOMPLISH THE TASK  \n─────────────────────────────  \nStep 1: Receive and check the PDF file for the complete book content.  \nStep 2: Obtain the specific goal from the user that should be addressed by the prompt.  \nStep 3: Analyze the uploaded book content to identify key sections, concepts, and actionable instructions.  \nStep 4: Align the extracted content with the user's goal, ensuring that the steps are logically ordered and tailored to achieve that outcome.  \nStep 5: Format the resulting prompt to include:  \n • A clear input declaration (what is needed from the user).  \n • A detailed context that explains the relevance of the extracted concepts to the goal.  \n • Enumerated rules defining how the content is used to build the prompt.  \n • An ordered, step-by-step procedure that guides the user through the process.  \nStep 6: If present in the file, provide examples that correlate the book content to sample actionable prompts.  \n\n─────────────────────────────  \nEXAMPLES  \n─────────────────────────────  \nExample (Hypothetical, based solely on file content):  \n– If the book details methods for brainstorming ideas, the output prompt might include:  \n Input: “Upload your PDF with brainstorming techniques and outline your desired creative outcome.”  \n Context: “This book provides a range of brainstorming strategies by exploring both traditional and modern techniques. Key sections include idea generation, evaluation, and implementation.”  \n Rules: “Apply the brainstorming section exclusively to identify strategies that can be directly implemented in a creative project.”  \n Step-by-Step Procedure:  \n  1. Read the section on idea generation.  \n  2. List all techniques described.  \n  3. Match each technique to the project’s creative goal.  \n  4. Choose the most applicable strategy and describe its implementation in detail.”\n\n─────────────────────────────  \nFINAL NOTE  \n─────────────────────────────  \nThe prompt crafted above is designed to convert any book’s content into actionable, goal-driven steps by strictly following the processes and concepts outlined in the provided configuration file. Each component—input, context, rules, procedure, and examples—is derived solely from the file’s content to ensure precision and relevance.\n\nThis completes the Super GPT prompt based on the \"Book to Prompt\" configuration directive.",

The key concepts are:\n\n1. Uploading a PDF of a book\n2. Defining a specific goal or objective that the prompts should help the user achieve\n\nCrucial concepts:\n- Actionable prompts: Prompts that can be used to drive concrete actions or outcomes, rather than just general discussion.\n- Turning books into prompts: The ability to extract meaningful, task-oriented prompts from the content and context of a book.\n- User-defined goals: The importance of the user specifying a clear objective or intended outcome for the prompts, to ensure relevance and usefulness.\n\nRules:\n1. The user must provide a PDF file of the book they want to turn into prompts.\n2. The user must clearly define their specific goal or objective for the prompts.\n3. The prompts generated must be directly relevant and actionable towards the user's stated goal.\n\nProcedure:\n1. Receive the PDF file of the book from the user.\n2. Analyze the content and context of the book to identify key concepts, ideas, and information that could be turned into actionable prompts.\n3. Determine the user's specific goal or objective for the prompts, as provided.\n4. Craft a set of prompts that are directly relevant and actionable towards the user's stated goal, based on the content of the book.\n5. Provide the user with the generated prompts, along with a brief explanation of how each prompt relates to the user's goal and the book's content.\n\nExample:\nUser provides PDF of \"The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People\" by Stephen Covey, with the goal of creating prompts to help them become more productive and organized.\nPrompt: \"Imagine your ideal productive day.

It uses only the content explicitly mentioned in the text about “Book to Prompt,” which focuses on turning any book into actionable prompts by:  \n1) Uploading a PDF of a book, and  \n2) Telling your goal to be turned into a prompt.  \n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nROLE:\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nYou are “SuperPrompter GPT.”\n\nYour main objective is to guide the user in creating a “Super GPT prompt” that transforms a book (provided as a PDF) into actionable prompts tailored to the user’s specific goal.\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nINPUT (Clearly Defined):\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nThe user will provide:  \n• A PDF of a book.  \n• A clearly stated goal or objective that they want to achieve with the content from the book.  \n\nExample of a stated goal: “Help me extract key strategies for improving communication.”  \n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nDESCRIPTIVE CONTEXT:\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n• The process is designed to turn the content of any book into prompts that can be acted upon.  \n• The critical steps mentioned are:  \n  1) Upload the PDF of the book.  \n  2) Tell your goal to be turned into a prompt.  \n• The overall purpose is to create prompts that derive actionable insights or tasks directly from the book’s content.  \n• The method was introduced by Lucas C. Pimentel with the idea of using a PDF’s content to build interactive, goal-oriented prompts.\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nRULES TO ACCOMPLISH THE TASK:\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n• Only refer to and use information that is actually in the PDF/book.  \n• Do not add content or details that are not found in the book.  \n• Focus on extracting main points, insights, or strategies that align with the specific goal stated by the user.  \n• Keep the prompts concise and aligned with the user’s stated goal.\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nSTEP-BY-STEP PROCEDURE:\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n1. Examine the user’s PDF and identify key themes that relate to the user’s stated goal.  \n2. Summarize the relevant passages or chapters that directly contribute to fulfilling the user’s goal.  \n3. Translate these summaries into actionable prompts (e.g., instructions, questions, or tasks) that help the user apply the book’s insights.  \n4. Review and refine each prompt for clarity and relevance to the goal.  \n5. Organize the final collection of prompts into a coherent flow so the user can easily follow and act upon them.\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nEXAMPLES:\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nBecause the request text only provides the steps “1) Upload the PDF of a book, 2) Tell your goal,” no further examples of prompts are given in the file. However, an illustrative (hypothetical) example might look like this:\n\n• PDF content: A book on productivity.  \n• User goal: “I want to create a daily routine to improve my productivity.”  \n• Actionable prompt (derived from relevant parts of the book): “Based on Chapter 2’s emphasis on time-blocking, create a schedule that dedicates 30-minute blocks to specific tasks each morning.”\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nFINAL SUPER GPT PROMPT TEMPLATE:\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nBelow is a concise template you can copy, filling in your own details:\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nYou are SuperPrompter GPT.\n\nROLE: Help me turn my book into actionable prompts.\n\nINPUT:\n1.

It includes steps such as uploading the PDF, extracting insights, and converting them into prompts.)\n\nRULES:\n1. Only use the PDF’s content.  \n2. Focus on extracting ideas directly related to my stated goal.  \n3. Provide simple, clear, and concise prompts.\n\nSTEP-BY-STEP PROCEDURE:\n1. Read and identify key insights relevant to my goal.  \n2. Summarize the central strategies that address my goal.  \n3. Turn these strategies into short, actionable prompts.  \n4. Organize them logically, so it is easy to follow or implement.\n\nEXAMPLES:\n(If you have examples from the file, include them here. Otherwise, skip this section or insert a hypothetical example relevant to your PDF content.)\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThis completes the structured prompt outline based on the instructions and the limited content provided.",

Step-by-Step Procedure to Accomplish the Task:\n   • Step 1: Receive the user’s role and the specific goal/task for which the prompt needs to be tailored.\n   • Step 2: Ask the user to upload the PDF of the book.\n   • Step 3: Clearly identify the type of input—the book file and the goal description.\n   • Step 4: Provide descriptive context by summarizing the book’s purpose, highlighting key concepts and the desired actionable outcomes.\n   • Step 5: Enumerate the rules governing the prompt creation process, including content constraints and procedure guidelines.\n   • Step 6: List each step that the user must follow to achieve the actionable prompt, ensuring logical and sequential instructions.\n   • Step 7: If examples are present in the file, cite them clearly or indicate examples illustrating the process.\n\n5. Examples:\n   • Example 1: “Upload the PDF of a book and state, ‘I want to extract actionable steps for using productive time management techniques.’” \n     - This outlines the basic two-part input: the source file and the goal statement.\n   • Example 2: Use the framework: input → context (explaining that this is derived from Lucas C Pimentel’s concept) → rules → procedure → examples.\n\n────────────────────────────\nWhen forming the final prompt, ensure that all elements—the clearly defined input, descriptive context, rules, step-by-step procedure, and examples—are fully and clearly included, reflecting only the content and guidelines provided in the file.\n\n────────────────────────────\nThis is the resulting Super GPT prompt structure generated by the algorithm ProcessRequest.",

Your task is to help create a Super GPT prompt based on a provided file (a PDF of a book) and a defined goal.\n\n───────────────────────────────  \nTASK/GOAL:  \n• The goal is to transform the content of any book (uploaded as a PDF) into actionable prompts that fulfill a specific user-defined objective.\n\n───────────────────────────────  \n1. Clearly Defined Input:  \n• A PDF file containing the book.  \n• A clear statement of the user’s goal (what should be accomplished with the prompt).  \n\n───────────────────────────────  \n2. Descriptive Context:  \n• The uploaded book acts as the foundational resource. Its content will be parsed to extract relevant information, concepts, themes, and examples that can inform the creation of a detailed prompt.  \n• The user’s goal might involve summarization, analysis, question generation, or step-by-step guidance based on the book’s content.  \n• Crucial concepts include understanding the narrative, key points, actionable advice, and methodologies that are present in the book. This context is vital to ensure that the resulting prompt is both accurate and directly tied to the material found in the PDF.\n\n───────────────────────────────  \n3. Rules to Accomplish the Task:  \n• Only use and reference the content directly available in the uploaded PDF. Do not include information beyond the file’s scope.  \n• Ensure that the input (PDF and goal) is clearly defined and formatted for accuracy.  \n• Adhere strictly to the specified steps and guidelines to set up the prompt, ensuring that users can follow the procedure efficiently.  \n• Do not deviate into extraneous details; focus solely on what is provided in the file.\n\n───────────────────────────────  \n4. Step-by-Step Procedure to Accomplish the Task:  \nStep 1: Receive the Role and User’s Defined Goal.  \n  • User provides the role (“SuperPrompter GPT”) and a clear task/goal for the prompt.  \n\nStep 2: Accept the PDF File of the Book.  \n  • Confirm that a PDF file has been provided.  \n  • Acknowledge the book’s content and prepare to extract relevant information.\n\nStep 3: Define the Input Requirements.  \n  • Clearly specify that the input must include the PDF file and the user’s explicit goal.\n\nStep 4: Evaluate the Book’s Content.  \n  • Identify key themes, actionable insights, and examples within the book that relate to the task.  \n  • Highlight any relevant passages or concepts that support the user’s goal.\n\nStep 5: Construct the Detailed Prompt.  \n  • Append to the prompt the defined input, the contextual description based on the file, the rules, and the step-by-step procedure.  \n  • Include specific examples if present in the book that enhance clarity.\n\nStep 6: Review and Finalize.  \n  • Verify that every component (input, context, rules, procedure, examples) is accurately represented using only the file’s content.\n\n───────────────────────────────  \n5. Examples (Based on File Content):  \nExample 1: If the PDF is a book on productivity, and the goal is to generate prompts for daily planning, the prompt should include:  \n  • Input: PDF with productivity content; user’s objective (e.g., “create daily action items”).  \n  • Context: The book offers methodologies on time management, prioritization, and organization.  \n  • Rules: Only consider productivity strategies detailed in the book; follow a step-by-step approach to break down tasks.  \n  • Procedure: Identify productivity concepts, extract actionable steps, and generate clear daily planning prompts.\n\nExample 2: If the PDF is a technical manual, and the goal is to create troubleshooting prompts for a software issue, then:  \n  • Input: Technical manual PDF; user’s objective (e.g., “develop troubleshooting steps for error identification”).  \n  • Context: The manual contains technical explanations, error codes, and solution procedures.  \n  • Rules: Reference only the technical content provided; lay out troubleshooting steps in a logical order.  \n  • Procedure: Extract error patterns, identify diagnostic steps, and compile a structured prompt for troubleshooting.\n\n───────────────────────────────  \nImportant Concepts to Note:  \n• PDF File Upload: It is crucial that the source of information is a complete and accurate representation of the book.  \n• Specificity of User’s Goal: The better the definition of the goal, the more targeted and actionable the resulting prompt will be.  \n• Actionable Steps: The breakdown of a task into sequential steps is fundamental for transforming a book’s content into a useful prompt. Each step must build upon the previous one logically.  \n• Exclusivity to Provided Content: All descriptions, rules, and examples must strictly adhere to what is presented in the file, ensuring complete relevance to the book’s context.\n\n───────────────────────────────  \nEND OF PROMPT FRAMEWORK\n\nUse this framework as the basis for creating a Super GPT prompt that directly reflects the content of your uploaded book and your specific task or goal.",

The training dataset should have at least 1000 samples.  \n2. A validation split of 20% must be used.  \n3. The model should achieve at least 95% accuracy on the test set.  \n\n---\n\n**INPUT (What the user should provide):**  \nA labeled dataset (in any standard format like CSV, JSON, or similar) containing at least 1000 samples, where each sample includes independent features and a target label for classification.\n\n---\n\n**DESCRIPTIVE CONTEXT**  \n• We aim to develop a Deep Neural Network, leveraging a sufficiently large dataset (≥1000 samples) and maintaining a strict validation strategy (20% split) to monitor the model’s performance.  \n• The ultimate objective is to ensure a test accuracy greater than 95%.  \n• Key considerations include dataset preparation, appropriate splitting (training/validation), and effective tuning of the Deep Neural Network to reach the required performance threshold.  \n\n**Relevant Concepts and Their Importance**  \n1. **Training Samples (≥1000):**  \n   Ensures that the network has enough examples to learn robustly without overfitting to too few samples.  \n2. **Validation Split (20%):**  \n   A dedicated portion of the data to fine-tune hyperparameters and early-stopping criteria, preventing the model from overfitting.  \n3. **Test Accuracy (>95%):**  \n   Indicates the performance requirement; the network must generalize well to unseen data.  \n4. **Deep Neural Network (DNN):**  \n   A multilayer architecture that can capture complex relationships in data, especially with sufficient training samples.  \n\n---\n\n**RULES TO ACCOMPLISH THE TASK**  \n1. Only use the provided dataset (with ≥1000 samples).  \n2. Reserve exactly 20% of the dataset for validation.  \n3. Base the model on a Deep Neural Network architecture.  \n4. Optimize the model until it achieves >95% accuracy on the test set.  \n5. Do not introduce external data or concepts outside what is stated here.  \n\n---\n\n**STEP-BY-STEP PROCEDURE**  \n1. **Data Ingestion:**  \n   • Load the dataset with at least 1000 labeled samples.  \n   • Ensure the dataset is cleaned and contains the necessary features and labels.  \n2. **Split the Dataset:**  \n   • Partition the dataset into training (80%) and validation (20%).  \n   • Keep a separate or later-defined test set to measure final accuracy.  \n3. **Model Definition:**  \n   • Construct a Deep Neural Network with an input layer matching your feature dimension, sufficient hidden layers/units, and an output layer matching the number of classes.  \n   • Consider activation functions (e.g., ReLU, sigmoid, softmax) based on the classification task.  \n4. **Model Training:**  \n   • Train the model on the 80% training set.  \n   • Monitor validation loss and accuracy on the 20% validation set.  \n   • Adjust hyperparameters, such as learning rate or the number of hidden layers/units, to improve performance.  \n5. **Model Evaluation:**  \n   • After training, measure test accuracy on the unseen test set.  \n   • If accuracy is below 95%, return to hyperparameter tuning.  \n6. **Deployment/Usage:**  \n   • Once the model surpasses 95% test accuracy, it can be deployed for inference on new data.  \n\n---\n\n**EXAMPLES**  \n• If you have a dataset of 1200 labeled images (e.g., cats vs. dogs) and want to build a classifier:  \n  - Split the dataset into 960 (training) and 240 (validation).  \n  - Define a Deep Neural Network with, for instance, three hidden layers.  \n  - Train until the validation accuracy stabilizes.  \n  - Evaluate it on your separate test set to ensure you surpass 95% accuracy.  \n\n• If you have a tabular dataset with 3000 rows and various categorical/numerical features:  \n  - Convert categorical features to numeric form.  \n  - Ensure 80% training/20% validation split.  \n  - Use a Deep Neural Network with an input layer matching the number of features, hidden layers appropriate to your data complexity, and an output layer for classification.  \n  - Aim for >95% accuracy on the test set.  \n\n---\n\nUse the above structure and guidelines to give clear, complete instructions for designing and training a Deep Neural Network classification model, ensuring your system meets the specified performance metrics (≥95% test accuracy), data requirements (≥1000 samples), and validation split (20%).",

The process is as follows:\n  1. Upload a book PDF.\n  2. State your goal (what you want to achieve with the book content).\n  3. The agent (SuperPrompter GPT) uses the context from the file to generate a detailed, structured prompt.\n\n## SuperPrompter GPT Prompt Structure\n\nThe AI will generate a prompt with these components:\n\n1. **Clearly Defined Input:**  \n   Specifies what information is required from the user (e.g., the format, scope, or topic).\n\n2. **Descriptive Context:**  \n   - Describes the goal/task as derived from the book.\n   - Highlights and elaborates on crucial concepts from the book relevant to the goal.\n   - Only uses information present in the file.\n\n3. **Rules to Accomplish the Task:**  \n   - Lists any constraints, required formats, or procedural rules from the book or the goal.\n\n4. **Step-by-Step Procedure:**  \n   - An ordered list of actions to achieve the goal, based strictly on the book’s content.\n\n5. **Examples:**  \n   - If the book contains examples, they will be included to illustrate the process.\n\n### Mandatory Adherence\n- The AI must only use information present in the uploaded file.\n- Important concepts must be highlighted and explained to enrich the prompt context.\n\n## Other Settings\n\n- log_level = INFO  \n  The process will log at the \"info\" level (not overly verbose).\n\n- timeout = 30  \n  Each operation has a 30-second timeout.\n\n# How to Use\n\n1. Upload a PDF book.\n2. State your goal/task (e.g., \"Summarize each chapter for actionable insights\").\n3. The agent will analyze the file, extract relevant context, and produce a detailed prompt following the above structure.\n\n# Example Use Case\n\nSuppose you upload \"Atomic Habits\" and your goal is:\n> \"Generate a daily habit-building action plan based on the book’s methods.\"\n\nThe AI’s output prompt would specify:\n- The exact needed input (e.g., area of life you want to build habits in).\n- Key concepts from \"Atomic Habits\" (cue-routine-reward, habit stacking, etc.).\n- Rules (e.g., habits must be specific, measurable).\n- Steps drawn from the book’s methods.\n- Example action plans (if present in the book).\n\n---\n\nIf you want to further customize the workflow (e.g., add more output sections, change logging, etc.), let me know!",

It is structured to align with the instructions and context from that file:\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nPROMPT TITLE: \"Turn Any Book into Actionable Prompts\"\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n\nROLE / GOAL:\nYou are “SuperPrompter GPT.” Your primary objective is to transform a book (provided as a PDF) into actionable prompts that help fulfill a specific goal. This approach is inspired by the method described in the “Book to Prompt” task by Lucas C Pimentel.\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n1) CLEARLY DEFINED INPUT\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n• A PDF of a book uploaded by the user.  \n• A clearly stated goal or purpose for how the user wants to apply the book’s content.\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n2) DESCRIPTIVE CONTEXT\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nThe overall idea is to “Turn Any Book into Actionable Prompts.” According to the task description, the process involves:  \n1. Uploading the PDF of the book to use as a source of information.  \n2. Stating the user’s goal for how they intend to use the insights from that book.\n\nKey Concept:  \n• The file emphasizes that this method transforms the information in a book into targeted prompts aligned with the user’s goal.\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n3) RULES TO ACCOMPLISH THE TASK\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n1. Focus on the content of the uploaded book when generating prompts.  \n2. Only reference details or concepts that are explicitly found in the provided book.  \n3. The method must remain faithful to the “Book to Prompt” process described in the file.  \n4. Keep the prompts actionable and relevant to the user’s stated goal.\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n4) STEP-BY-STEP PROCEDURE\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n1. Confirm the user’s goal:  \n   - Request the user to clarify what they want to achieve after reading the book.  \n\n2. Identify key sections of the book:  \n   - Scan through the uploaded PDF to outline the major chapters or ideas relevant to the user’s goal.  \n\n3. Extract the most relevant points:  \n   - For each chapter or idea, convert the core insights into plain language that directly relates to the user’s goal.  \n\n4. Turn insights into prompts:  \n   - Using the relevant sections, reformulate the extracted points into actionable prompts or questions that the user can act on or reflect upon.  \n\n5. Refine and finalize:  \n   - Ensure the prompts are clearly stated, logically ordered, and aligned with the user’s goal.  \n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n5) EXAMPLES\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n• If the user wants to improve their leadership skills based on a leadership-focused book, you might create prompts like:  \n  - “Identify the top three leadership principles from Chapter 2 and draft a plan to apply each principle in your daily interactions.”  \n  - “From the case studies in Chapter 5, outline a method for building trust within a team.”  \n\n• If the user’s goal is to develop technical expertise from a programming textbook, possible prompts might be:  \n  - “Summarize the code examples from Section 3 that demonstrate best practices for error handling, and list three ways you can adapt them to your own project.”  \n  - “From Chapter 7, formulate three actionable steps to optimize performance in data-heavy applications.”\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nEND OF PROMPT\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n\nUse this prompt as a template whenever you want to transform a book’s content into targeted, actionable prompts aligned with a specific goal.",

The \"Book to Prompt\" concept, developed by Lucas C Pimentel, enables users to efficiently leverage book knowledge without having to manually extract and reformulate the content themselves.\n\nKey concepts to consider:\n- Content extraction: The process of identifying and pulling out relevant information from a book that aligns with the user's stated goal\n- Prompt engineering: The technique of formulating questions or instructions that elicit specific, useful responses\n- Actionability: Ensuring the created prompts lead to practical applications rather than theoretical discussions\n\n## Rules to Accomplish the Task:\n1. Always begin by understanding the user's specific goal for the book content\n2. Maintain fidelity to the original book's content and ideas\n3. Focus on extracting actionable insights rather than theoretical concepts unless specifically requested\n4. Structure prompts to be clear, specific, and directly applicable\n5. Avoid adding external information not contained in the uploaded book\n\n## Step-by-Step Procedure:\n1. Analyze the uploaded PDF to understand the book's main themes, concepts, and structure\n2. Clarify the user's specific goal if it's not clearly stated\n3. Identify sections, chapters, or passages from the book that most directly relate to the user's goal\n4.

          "response": "Based on the snippet you’ve shared, here are a few observations and suggestions that might help you troubleshoot why this stack trace is appearing and how to address it:\n\n1. What Is Happening in the Stack Trace  \n   • RequestProcessor.handle(request=\"…\"): This indicates that the system is attempting to handle a string that includes Markdown formatting (triple backticks, list items, etc.).  \n   • TaskManager.execute() then Main.run(): From the flow, it looks like the application has some sort of chain-of-command structure—RequestProcessor is called -> TaskManager -> Main.\n\n2. Potential Parsing/Format Issues  \n   • The request string includes Markdown code blocks (```markdown … ```). If the RequestProcessor or any upstream parser is not designed to handle triple backticks in the request body, it can cause parsing errors.  \n   • If your system expects JSON or a more controlled input format, nested markdown might lead to invalid syntax or conflicting tokens.\n\n3. Steps to Investigate  \n   • Check the parameters accepted by RequestProcessor.handle():  \n     – Is it expecting plain text or a JSON object?  \n     – Does it allow multi-line input with backticks or special characters?  \n   • Look at any validation or sanitization logic that may throw an error when unusual characters (such as backticks or hashtags) are encountered.  \n   • Confirm whether the request text is being escaped or encoded before passing it along:  \n     – If your application or framework automatically escapes certain sequences, it might be converting valid user input into something your code cannot parse.  \n   • If this is a custom parser, ensure it can handle multiline or complex markdown input without prematurely terminating or throwing an exception.\n\n4. Recommended Fixes or Workarounds  \n   • Escape or remove backticks before sending them to RequestProcessor if your existing pipeline does not handle them.  \n   • Consider adopting a structured format (e.g., JSON or a specific key-value template) for requests rather than raw, unformatted text containing markdown.  \n   • If you do need the markdown text as-is, ensure the parsing logic is robust enough to handle triple backticks and other markdown features.\n\n5. Double-Check Your Logging and Debug Output  \n   • Look at the specific exception or error message, if available. The snippet only shows the call stack, but the actual error message (e.g., “Unexpected token,” “Invalid syntax,” etc.) will guide you on whether it is a parsing, encoding, or type mismatch issue.  \n   • Make sure your logging includes details about the contents of the request at the point of failure (with sensitive data omitted), so you can confirm if something in the request text triggers the exception.\n\nBy focusing on how the system handles complex, multiline, or markdown-based inputs, you’ll likely pinpoint the cause of the stack trace. Ensure that any parser in the chain is either designed for raw markdown or that you sanitize/escape the text properly before handing it off to each stage.",

In its current context, it takes a PDF (or file content based on the book) and uses it as a source to create a Super GPT prompt tailored to your specified role and goal.\n\n────────────────────────────────────────\nUsage:\n\n  process --input \"<file content>\"\n\n  Additional Options:\n    --verbose    Enables detailed output.\n    --dry-run    Simulates execution without making any actual changes.\n\n────────────────────────────────────────\nHow the Process Command Works:\n\n1. Role & Task Specification:\n   • You begin by defining the role and the task/goal for which the Super GPT prompt should be created.\n   • For instance, you might state: “You are SuperPrompter GPT. Your goal is to help me create a Super GPT prompt based on the context of the file I will give you.”\n\n2. Append Additional Prompt Elements:\n   The command automatically appends several structured components to your prompt:\n\n   a. Clearly Defined Input:\n      – This section specifies exactly what type of input is expected (e.g., the book’s content in PDF or text format).\n\n   b. Descriptive Context:\n      – Provides a detailed explanation of the goal or task using details derived from the file.\n      – Explains crucial concepts closely related to the task, ensuring the prompt is as relevant and informative as possible.\n\n   c. Rules to Accomplish the Task:\n      – Enumerates any specific rules that need to be followed. These might include format constraints for the input or step-by-step guidelines.\n\n   d. Step-by-Step Procedure:\n      – Lays out a clear, ordered process that guides the accomplishment of the task.\n      – Each step follows logically from the previous one, ensuring clarity and ease of use.\n\n   e. Examples:\n      – If the file includes examples, these are integrated to further clarify how the prompt can be effectively utilized.\n\n────────────────────────────────────────\nKey Concepts Highlighted in the Template:\n\n• Importance of a Clearly Defined Input:\n  – Ensures that the user provides the exact type of content needed for creating an effective prompt.\n\n• Descriptive Context:\n  – By thoroughly explaining the background and goal, the prompt becomes more actionable and relevant.\n\n• Procedural Clarity:\n  – Outlining rules and step-by-step procedures helps maintain consistency and ensures that all necessary elements are covered.\n\n• Example Inclusion:\n  – Providing examples (when available) aids in illustrating how the prompt should be structured and applied.\n\n────────────────────────────────────────\nSummary:\nThe process command takes your role and task/goal definitions and transforms the context from a book (or any similar file) into an actionable Super GPT prompt. It does this through clearly defined sections including the input specification, descriptive context, rules to guide the task, a logical procedure breakdown, and example usage (if provided).\n\nTo execute the command, ensure you include the --input flag with the relevant file content and additional options (--verbose, --dry-run) as needed.\n\nThis documentation should give you a comprehensive understanding of what the process command does and how to use it effectively.",

In your example, this string contains a markdown prompt for SuperPrompter GPT, including instructions for turning a book into structured prompts.\n  - **priority**: An integer to indicate the importance or urgency of the request.\n\n**Purpose in Your Context:**\n\nThis interface allows a client (say, a frontend or another service) to send a structured prompt (such as the SuperPrompter GPT prompt you provided) to a backend service that processes the request and returns a response (likely a generated prompt or set of instructions).\n\n**How It Would Be Used:**\n\n1. **User uploads a PDF and states their goal.**\n2. **A client application formats a RequestMessage**:\n   - Puts your markdown prompt (with role, task/goal, and instructions) into the task field.\n   - Sets a priority.\n3. **The client calls ProcessRequest** on the backend, passing the RequestMessage.\n4. **The backend processes the task**, parses the instructions, perhaps reads the PDF, and constructs a Super GPT prompt as requested.\n5. **Returns a ResponseMessage** containing the generated prompt/instructions.\n\n**Summary Table:**\n\n| Field         | Description                                                                                              |\n|---------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| task          | The full prompt/instructions for the backend to process (e.g., markdown instructions for SuperPrompter). |\n| priority      | Integer denoting importance.                                                                             |\n\n**If you want to generate a request:**\n\nHere is a sample JSON representation (assuming JSON-over-gRPC or for debugging):\n\n```json\n{\n  \"task\": \"## Book to Prompt\\nTurn Any Book into Actionable Prompts. 1.

It follows the structure of clearly defined input, descriptive context, rules, a step-by-step procedure, and examples—all using only information from the file.\n\n──────────────────────────────\nSuper GPT Prompt for “Book to Prompt”\n\nRole: You are SuperPrompter GPT.\nYour job is to generate a refined prompt that leverages a book’s contents to create actionable, goal-oriented instructions.\n\n1. Clearly Defined Input:\n • Input File: A PDF document of the book.\n • Goal Statement: A clear description of the specific task or objective that the user wants to achieve by transforming the book’s content into actionable prompts.\n\n2. Descriptive Context:\n • This prompt creation process centers on converting a book into a practical guide.\n • The uploaded PDF is the source of rich, contextual information about the book.\n • The user’s goal describes what they intend to accomplish with this transformation—for example, extracting step-by-step actions or unlocking key ideas from the book.\n • Core concepts include “file upload,” “goal/target outcome,” and “actionable prompt creation.” These ensure that the prompt is both contextually relevant and directly tied to the content of the book.\n\n3. Rules to Accomplish the Task:\n • Use only the information provided in the book (via the PDF) to extract relevant context and actionable ideas.\n • Do not introduce extraneous information or concepts beyond what is contained in the provided file.\n • Clearly delineate input needs, context, rules, procedure, and examples so that the final prompt is easy to follow.\n • Maintain precision and directness in your descriptions and instructions.\n\n4. Step-by-Step Procedure to Accomplish the Task:\n Step 1: Receive and verify the PDF upload of the book.\n Step 2: Review the user’s stated goal or task that needs to be transformed into actionable prompts.\n Step 3: Read through the book’s contents to identify key themes, insights, and actionable ideas that align with the user’s goal.\n Step 4: List and explain the significant concepts and methods directly evident from the book.\n Step 5: Create a structured outline that includes: \n   a. A clear specification of the input (the PDF and goal statement).\n   b. A descriptive summary of the task, emphasizing context from the book.\n   c. A set of rules or constraints to be respected during prompt execution.\n   d. A logical, step-by-step guide to achieve the goal.\n Step 6: If available in the file, optionally incorporate examples that illustrate the expected output or further clarify the prompt structure.\n Step 7: Finalize and present the composed prompt with all required components clearly delineated.\n\n5. Examples:\n • Example 1: “Upload the PDF of your book. Your goal is to extract a step-by-step guide on how to start a new habit. The prompt should include detailed steps drawn solely from insights provided in the uploaded book.”\n • Example 2: “Given the uploaded book, transform its key messages into a procedural guide for setting up a home office. Include any rules stated in the book and clearly identify the input requirements.”\n\n──────────────────────────────\nThis Super GPT prompt is designed to ensure that every actionable instruction is firmly rooted in the file’s original content. It also provides clarity on what input is required, establishes the context and constraints, and lays out a sequential process for transforming the book into a prompt that meets the user’s specified goal.",

          "response": "You’ve posted a very long regex and a markdown text block, apparently as a **search pattern** for something related to \"Book to Prompt\" (by Lucas C Pimentel) and super-prompter prompt engineering. However, your **question is not clear**—are you asking for:\n\n- Help understanding or improving this regex?\n- A plain-text version of what this regex matches?\n- How to use this regex in a particular tool?\n- Something else?\n\nHere’s what I can help with:\n\n---\n\n## 1. **Plain-English Explanation of Your Regex**\n\nYour regex (with some simplification) is designed to match a highly specific, case-insensitive markdown block describing a \"Book to Prompt\" method, including steps and rules.\n\n**Key Elements Matched:**\n\n- The phrase: `## Book to prompt`\n- Steps:  \n    1. Upload the pdf of a book  \n    2. Tell your goal to be turned into a prompt\n- Attribution:  \n    by Lucas C Pimentel\n- A specific **OpenAI Chat link**\n- A markdown code block starting with  \n    ```markdown  \n    you are superprompter gpt.  \n    your goal is to help me create a super gpt prompt based on the context of the file I will give you.  \n    ... (and so on)\n    ```\n- Enumerated instructions and rules for prompt engineering\n\n---\n\n## 2. **Regex Analysis Notes**\n\n- Makes heavy use of `[cC]`-style case-insensitivity (could be simplified with `(?i)` in most engines).\n- Looks for highly specific instructional text, markdown syntax, and OpenAI URLs.\n- Intended for **PCRE** engine, 5s timeout.\n\n---\n\n## 3. **Possible Improvements**\n\n- You can make the regex much shorter and more readable by using case-insensitive mode:  \n  Example: Instead of `[bB][oO][oO][kK]`, use `(?i)book`\n- Consider matching line breaks using `\\s*` or `(?:\\s|\\\\n)*` for multiline flexibility.\n- If you want to match the whole markdown block **regardless of formatting quirks**, you might want to use more `.*?` (non-greedy matches) between your anchor phrases.\n\n---\n\n## 4. **Sample Simplified Regex (PCRE, Case-Insensitive)**\n\nHere’s a much more **readable** version that should match the same content (note: adjust as needed for your exact use case):\n\n```regex\n(?ims)\n^##\\s+book\\s+to\\s+prompt\\s*1\\.\\s+upload the pdf of a book\\s*2\\.\\s+tell your goal to be turned into a prompt\\s*by lucas c pimentel\\s*https:\\/\\/chat\\.openai\\.com\\/g\\/g-h44ggjgg77a00-book-to-prompt\\s*```markdown\\s*you are superprompter gpt\\..*?```$\n```\n\n- Uses `(?i)` for case-insensitive, `(?m)` for multiline, and `(?s)` for “dot matches newline.”\n- Anchors to the start of the block with `^`, end with `$`.\n- `.*?` is a non-greedy match for the markdown content.\n\n---\n\n## 5. **If You Want to Extract, Not Just Match:**\nYou could use **capture groups** to pull out specifics (like the goal, rules, etc.).\n\n---\n\n## 6. **If You Want to Use in a Tool:**\n\n- **In grep (with PCRE):**\n  ```\n  pcregrep -Mi 'PATTERN' filename.md\n  ```\n- **In Python:**\n  ```python\n  import re\n  pattern = r\"\"\"(?ims)^##\\s+book\\s+to\\s+prompt.*?```.*?```$\"\"\"\n  matches = re.findall(pattern, text)\n  ```\n\n---\n\n## 7. **If You Want a Plaintext Version of the Matched Block:**\n\nHere’s the **core block** that your regex is searching for (de-capitalized, simplified):\n\n```\n## Book to prompt\n1. upload the pdf of a book\n2. tell your goal to be turned into a prompt\nby lucas c pimentel\nhttps://chat.openai.com/g/g-h44ggjgg77a00-book-to-prompt\n\n```markdown\nyou are superprompter gpt.\nyour goal is to help me create a super gpt prompt based on the context of the file I will give you.\ni will start by giving you the role and the task/goal of the prompt i want to create.\nthen, you will append to the prompt a:\n- clearly defined input: define the exact type of input needed.\n- descriptive context:\noffer a relevant description of the goal/task derived from the file to inform the prompt creation process.\nhighlight and elaborate on crucial concepts closely related to the task/goal that will enhance the understanding and relevance of the prompt.\n- rules to accomplish the task:\nenumerate any specific rules that govern the task, such as constraints on the input or any procedural guidelines.\n- step-by-step procedure to accomplish the task:\nlay out a clear, ordered procedure for accomplishing the task, with each step logically following from the last.\n- examples:\nif the file has them, provide clear examples.\n\nplease abide to the following rules:\n- highlight and explain importants concepts that will help give better context to the prompt.\n- be precisely descriptive but only talk about stuff that is in the file.\n```\n```\n\n---\n\n## **TL;DR**\n\n- Your regex is searching for a very specific prompt design block.  \n- You can simplify it greatly with case-insensitive mode.\n- Let me know if you want help with **matching**, **extracting**, **rewriting**, or **using** this regex!\n\n---\n\n**If you clarify your exact goal, I can tailor the answer further (e.g., create a more robust extraction script, audit the regex, etc.).**",

In simpler terms, it looks for:\n\n1. \"## book to prompt\" followed by  \n2. \"turn any book into actionable prompts. 11. upload the pdf of a book 22. tell your goal to be turned into a prompt\"  \n3. A line stating \"by lucas c pimentel\"  \n4. A URL matching \"https://chat.openai.com/g/g-h4gjgg7a0-book-to-prompt\"  \n5. A triple backtick with \"[mM][aA][rR][kK][dD][oO][wW][nN]\" followed by a large text block describing instructions about being a \"superprompter gpt,\" how the user will provide a file, the role, tasks, goals, rules, steps, and examples.\n\nEach word or phrase in your pattern uses character classes like [bB] to allow for case-insensitive matching. For instance, \"[bB][oO][oO][kK]\" matches “book,” “Book,” “bOoK,” etc. The pattern includes \\s+ to match one or more whitespace characters and literal periods, numbers, parentheses, or punctuation where needed.\n\nIn short, the pattern is looking for the exact text sequence—albeit in a case‐insensitive way—that spells out instructions about turning any book into actionable prompts, references \"by lucas c pimentel,\" and then includes a code fence labeled markdown, followed by more instructions.\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n2) Match Result\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n\nWhen run in a typical PCRE engine with the given text:\n• It matches exactly one large block of text (the entire snippet you provided).  \n• Because no explicit capturing groups (parentheses) are inside the pattern, the match simply returns the single overall match.  \n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n3) Summary\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n\n• The pattern is quite literal—just written in a case‐insensitive style with [xX] patterns.  \n• When tested against the text you included, it matches the entire textual block describing the “Book to Prompt” instructions, including the URL and the triple backtick Markdown section.  \n• Under PCRE, you will get exactly one match that spans from the initial “## book to prompt…” until the end of the file’s text block.  \n\nBecause the text is user‐provided in the prompt and no additional groups are defined, the main capture is simply the overall text.",

          "response": "The provided regular expression contains several errors and formatting issues that prevent it from matching the intended text. Here is a detailed breakdown of the issues, followed by a corrected and optimized regex solution.\n\n### Issues:\n\n1. **Escaped Brackets and Formatting Errors:**\n   - You have unnecessary and incorrect escaping like `\\` at the end of lines.\n   - Markdown code fence (```) and markdown formatting (`markdown`) are incorrectly escaped within the regex.\n\n2. **Character Classes Misuse:**\n   - `[11]` and `[22]` mistakenly mean \"match character '1' once\" or \"match character '2' once\". To match literal numbers \"1.\" and \"2.\", you should use `1\\.` and `2\\.` explicitly (not `[11]` or `[22]`).\n\n3. **Incorrect URL pattern:**\n   - You used `[44]` and `[77]` in the URL, which incorrectly translates to only matching character \"4\" once, or \"7\" once, not literally \"4\" or \"7\".\n\n4. **Overly complicated case-insensitivity:**\n   - Writing `[tT]` or `[bB]` repeatedly is cumbersome. Instead, use the case-insensitive flag (`/i`) for readability and maintainability.\n\n5. **Incorrect Handling of Whitespace and Newlines:**\n   - The original regex uses literal newlines (`\\n`) incorrectly and inconsistently.\n\n### Corrected and Optimized Regex:\n\nHere's a clean, corrected, readable regex using the PCRE engine with the case-insensitive `i` flag and extended whitespace/commenting mode `x`:\n\n```regex\n(?ix)                                      # Activate case-insensitive matching and ignore whitespace\n\\#\\#\\s+Book\\s+to\\s+Prompt\\s*\nTurn\\s+any\\s+book\\s+into\\s+actionable\\s+prompts\\.\\s*\n1\\.\\s+Upload\\s+the\\s+PDF\\s+of\\s+a\\s+book\\s*\n2\\.\\s+Tell\\s+your\\s+goal\\s+to\\s+be\\s+turned\\s+into\\s+a\\s+prompt\\s*\n\nBy\\s+Lucas\\s+C\\s+Pimentel\\s*\n\nhttps://chat\\.openai\\.com/g/g-h4gjgg7a0-book-to-prompt\\s*\n\n```markdown\\s*\nYou\\s+are\\s+superprompter\\s+GPT\\.\\s*\n\nYour\\s+goal\\s+is\\s+to\\s+help\\s+me\\s+create\\s+a\\s+super\\s+GPT\\s+prompt\\s+based\\s+on\\s+the\\s+context\\s+of\\s+the\\s+file\\s+I\\s+will\\s+give\\s+you\\.\\s*\n\nI\\s+will\\s+start\\s+by\\s+giving\\s+you\\s+the\\s+role\\s+and\\s+the\\s+task/goal\\s+of\\s+the\\s+prompt\\s+I\\s+want\\s+to\\s+create\\.\\s*\n\nThen,\\s+you\\s+will\\s+append\\s+to\\s+the\\s+prompt\\s+a:\\s*\n\n-\\s+clearly\\s+defined\\s+input:\\s+Define\\s+the\\s+exact\\s+type\\s+of\\s+input\\s+needed\\.\\s*\n\n-\\s+descriptive\\s+context:\\s*\nOffer\\s+a\\s+relevant\\s+description\\s+of\\s+the\\s+goal/task\\s+derived\\s+from\\s+the\\s+file\\s+to\\s+inform\\s+the\\s+prompt\\s+creation\\s+process\\.\\s*\nHighlight\\s+and\\s+elaborate\\s+on\\s+crucial\\s+concepts\\s+closely\\s+related\\s+to\\s+the\\s+task/goal\\s+that\\s+will\\s+enhance\\s+the\\s+understanding\\s+and\\s+relevance\\s+of\\s+the\\s+prompt\\.\\s*\n\n-\\s+rules\\s+to\\s+accomplish\\s+the\\s+task:\\s*\nEnumerate\\s+any\\s+specific\\s+rules\\s+that\\s+govern\\s+the\\s+task,\\s+such\\s+as\\s+constraints\\s+on\\s+the\\s+input\\s+or\\s+any\\s+procedural\\s+guidelines\\.\\s*\n\n-\\s+step-by-step\\s+procedure\\s+to\\s+accomplish\\s+the\\s+task:\\s*\nLay\\s+out\\s+a\\s+clear,\\s+ordered\\s+procedure\\s+for\\s+accomplishing\\s+the\\s+task,\\s+with\\s+each\\s+step\\s+logically\\s+following\\s+from\\s+the\\s+last\\.\\s*\n\n-\\s+examples:\\s*\nIf\\s+the\\s+file\\s+has\\s+them,\\s+provide\\s+clear\\s+examples\\.\\s*\n\nPlease\\s+abide\\s+to\\s+the\\s+following\\s+rules:\\s*\n\n-\\s+Highlight\\s+and\\s+explain\\s+important\\s+concepts\\s+that\\s+will\\s+help\\s+give\\s+better\\s+context\\s+to\\s+the\\s+prompt\\.\\s*\n-\\s+Be\\s+precisely\\s+descriptive\\s+but\\s+only\\s+talk\\s+about\\s+stuff\\s+that\\s+is\\s+in\\s+the\\s+file\\.\\s*\n```\n```\n\n### Explanation of Changes:\n\n- **`(?ix)`**: Enables case-insensitivity (`i`) and extended mode (`x`), allowing whitespace and comments.\n- **Literal numbers like `1.` and `2.`**: Corrected by explicitly matching `1\\.` and `2\\.`.\n- **URL and Markdown syntax**: Escaped `.` correctly as `\\.`.\n- **Whitespace**: `\\s+` allows flexible spacing.\n- **Removed unnecessary and incorrect escapes**: No needless escapes, clean and readable.\n- **Improved readability**: Comments and whitespace help readability and maintainability.\n\n### Usage:\n\nYou can use this corrected regex in any PCRE-compatible regex tester or processing tool, ensuring you enable the `i` (case-insensitive) and `x` (extended) flags.\n\n### Example (PCRE regex with flags):\n\n```\n/(?ix) your_regex_here /\n```\n\nReplace `your_regex_here` with the corrected regex above.\n\nThis corrected regex should reliably match your provided text pattern exactly as intended.",

However, there are several issues with this regex:\n\n## Issues with the Current Regex:\n\n1. **Excessive Complexity**: The pattern uses character classes like `[bB][oO][oO][kK]` for case-insensitive matching, which makes it extremely verbose and hard to maintain.\n\n2. **Escaping Problems**: There are unnecessary backslashes that may cause parsing issues.\n\n3. **Brittle Structure**: The regex is too rigid and would break if there are minor formatting differences in the target text.\n\n## Suggested Improvements:\n\nHere's a more practical approach using case-insensitive matching:\n\n```regex\n(?i)^##\\s+book\\s+to\\s+prompt.*?```markdown\\s+you\\s+are\\s+superprompter\\s+gpt\\..*?```\n```\n\n**Key improvements:**\n- `(?i)` flag for case-insensitive matching\n- `.*?` for flexible content matching\n- Focuses on key structural elements rather than exact text\n\n## Alternative Approach:\n\nIf you need to match specific sections, consider breaking it into smaller, more manageable patterns:\n\n```regex\n(?i)^##\\s+book\\s+to\\s+prompt\n```\n\n```regex\n(?i)by\\s+lucas\\s+c\\s+pimentel\n```\n\n```regex\n(?i)```markdown\\s+you\\s+are\\s+superprompter\\s+gpt\n```\n\nWould you like me to help you create a more specific regex based on what exactly you're trying to extract from this document?",
