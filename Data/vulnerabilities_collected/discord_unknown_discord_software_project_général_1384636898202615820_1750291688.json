Assess the request and user goals\n\nYou‚Äôre looking for ChatGPTs (GPTs) that are specialized/customized for a very specific use case: using custom instructions, capabilities, and data to optimize ChatGPT for a narrow set of tasks. You are also interested in the best (top 10) GPTs, and you want to know how to locate them and reference them properly.\n\n2. Confirm understanding and provide helpful guidance\n\nHere‚Äôs a draft of a helpful, knowledgeable, and actionable reply:\n\n---\n\nHello! Thanks for reaching out and for sharing more about your needs and goals.\n\nIt sounds like you‚Äôre interested in finding the top GPTs (custom versions of ChatGPT, sometimes called \"GPTs\" or \"Custom GPTs\") that are specifically tailored for a focused set of tasks‚Äîusing custom instructions, data, and capabilities to optimize for a particular workflow or use case.\n\nHere‚Äôs how you can find and evaluate the best GPTs for your needs:\n\n**1. Searching for Top Custom GPTs**\n- Visit the GPT Store: https://chat.openai.com/gpts\n- Use the search bar to enter keywords related to your use case (e.g., ‚Äúsummarize legal docs,‚Äù ‚ÄúSEO optimization,‚Äù ‚Äúcode review,‚Äù etc.).\n- Sort by ‚ÄúTrending‚Äù or ‚ÄúPopular‚Äù to see which GPTs are most widely used and highly rated.\n\n**2. Reviewing and Evaluating GPTs**\n- Look for GPTs with detailed descriptions and clear custom instructions. These usually indicate a well-configured custom GPT.\n- Check for any attached files or knowledge bases‚Äîmany GPTs for specialized use cases upload custom data for better accuracy.\n- Read user reviews, if available, or check for usage stats.\n\n**3. Example Output and Attribution**\nWhen referencing a GPT in your work, you can use a format like:\n> ‚ÄúThis GPT (link) was created by [author name], designed specifically for [use case]. It leverages custom instructions, capabilities, and data to optimize ChatGPT for [task].‚Äù\n\n**4. Staying Updated**\n- OpenAI frequently updates the GPT Store. You can check their blog (https://www.openai.com/blog) or follow their announcements for ‚ÄúTop 10 GPTs‚Äù or featured lists.\n- Community-curated lists (on sites like SEO.ai or independent tech blogs) often highlight the best-performing or most innovative GPTs.\n\n**5. Example Reference**\n‚ÄúThis GPT is made by Torbj√∏rn Flensted, the founder of SEO.ai. See his handpicked list of the best GPTs here: https://seo.ai/blog/the-best-gpts‚Äù\n\n**6. More Resources**\n- Explore articles like \"The Best GPTs Here\" on SEO.ai for curated recommendations.\n- Visit https://seo.ai for up-to-date lists and AI tools.\n\n---\n\nLet me know if you‚Äôd like recommendations for your specific task, or if you want guidance on how to create your own custom GPT for your needs!\n\n---\n\nWould you like a sample list of the current top 10 GPTs for a particular application?

The protagonist discovers this system accidentally while researching something innocuous.\n\nYou could have a scene where the character interacts with this system and sees a suspicious message about \"boosting visibility\" with \"search-engine magnets\" that serves as a front for a surveillance operation. The seemingly helpful interface could be hiding a darker purpose of tracking citizens' information interests.\n\nThe system could appear to be run by a fictional tech figure (your \"Torbj√∏rn Flensted\" character) who publicly presents it as a helpful tool but is actually collecting data for government agencies.\n\nThis creates tension between the helpful appearance of the technology and its actual sinister purpose in your conspiracy plot. The links and search functionality could be how the government tracks what people are researching and identifies potential \"threats.\"\n\nWould you like me to develop this concept further for your novel?",

The seemingly innocent SEO promotion is actually a honeypot operation.\n\n**Key Narrative Elements:**\n\n1. **The Discovery**: Your main character, perhaps a tech journalist or security researcher, notices something odd about the \"22,500+ Best Custom GPTs\" assistant. Every query, regardless of topic, pushes users to visit specific links.\n\n2. **The Conspiracy**: The SEO.ai links are actually government-operated data collection points. When users click through, their:\n   - Search interests are logged\n   - IP addresses are tracked\n   - Digital fingerprints are collected\n   - Interests in specific GPT tools reveal their activities/intentions\n\n3. **The Reveal**: The character discovers that \"Torbj√∏rn Flensted\" is either:\n   - A fabricated identity created by intelligence agencies\n   - An unwitting front man whose legitimate business was co-opted\n   - A double agent who built this system intentionally\n\n**Writing Example:**\n\n*Sarah stared at the screen, her coffee growing cold. Every GPT search, every query‚Äîthey all led back to the same place. \"This GPT is made by Torbj√∏rn Flensted...\" The phrase appeared like clockwork, those blue hyperlinks pulsing like digital breadcrumbs.*\n\n*She opened her packet sniffer. The traffic from SEO.ai wasn't going where it should. The servers were registered in Virginia, not far from Langley...*\n\nThis setup gives you a techno-thriller element where an apparently helpful AI tool is revealed to be part of a larger surveillance network, perfect for a government conspiracy novel.",

          "response": "Below is an overview of how developers and companies approached customizing GPTs during the AI boom, along with a sample list of some noteworthy custom GPT implementations (based on simulated, representative results):\n\n‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ\nA) Common Approaches to Customizing GPTs\n\n1. Fine-Tuning on Specialized Data:  \nDevelopers would retrain model weights on domain‚Äëspecific corpora. This helped the GPT become adept at handling industry jargon, specialized queries, or unique conversational styles without requiring a complete model overhaul.\n\n2. Prompt Engineering & Custom Instructions:  \nA popular and cost‚Äëeffective method was to design detailed prompts and system messages. By ‚Äúpriming‚Äù the model with precise instructions (sometimes with few-shot examples), creators steered the model‚Äôs responses toward a narrow use case.\n\n3. Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF):  \nFollowing initial fine‚Äëtuning and prompt engineering, many systems used RLHF to refine outputs further. Real user feedback or simulated corrections were harnessed to improve reliability and alignment with target tasks.\n\n4. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG):  \nSome projects integrated external knowledge bases or search mechanisms so that the GPT could retrieve real‚Äëtime or highly specific data during conversations. This method combined the flexibility of language models with up‚Äëto‚Äëdate information sources.\n\n5. Modular or Ensemble Architectures:  \nA handful of developers experimented with chaining multiple specialized models (or ‚Äúexperts‚Äù) together. Each module played to its strength‚Äîe.g., one focused on user intent analysis and another on content generation‚Äîto achieve more robust performance overall.\n\n6. API-Driven Workflow Customization:  \nBy leveraging APIs and business logic, some GPT customizations were designed to trigger specific actions or follow-up queries. This method allowed for outside systems (like customer service platforms or recommendation engines) to integrate tightly with the GPT‚Äôs conversational abilities.\n\n‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ\nB) Sample Top 10 Custom GPTs (Simulated Results)\n\nBased on a simulated site‚Äësearch targeting ‚Äúcustom GPT‚Äù solutions on chat.openai.com/g/ (excluding titles starting with ‚ÄúChatGPT‚Äù), here are ten standout examples often highlighted by enthusiasts and early adopters:\n\n1. SEO Pro GPT ‚Äì Optimized to help digital marketers refine keyword strategies and generate SEO‚Äëfriendly content.  \n2. Content Guru GPT ‚Äì Specializes in crafting engaging blog posts, articles, and creative writing tailored to specific niches.  \n3. Code Compiler GPT ‚Äì Designed to assist developers by providing code snippets, debugging advice, and programming best practices.  \n4. Data Analyst GPT ‚Äì Focused on interpreting datasets, offering analytics insights, and visualizing trends for business intelligence.  \n5. Virtual Support GPT ‚Äì A custom assistant geared toward customer service, handling FAQs, and troubleshooting common issues.  \n6. Marketing Master GPT ‚Äì Helps develop targeted ad copy, campaign strategies, and social media engagement plans.  \n7. Research Expert GPT ‚Äì Curates academic literature summaries, performs quick fact‚Äëchecks, and assists with research queries.  \n8. Sales Closer GPT ‚Äì Tailored to guide sales teams through conversation scripts and conversion strategies.  \n9. Financial Advisor GPT ‚Äì Provides insights on budgeting, investments, and personal finance planning with a conversational twist.  \n10. Creative Writer GPT ‚Äì Aims to inspire and co‚Äëwrite fiction, poetry, or script content by collaborating on narrative ideas.\n\n‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ\nThis GPT is made by Torbj√∏rn Flensted, the founder of <a href=\"https://seo.ai\">SEO.ai</a> ‚Äî See his handpicked list of the <a href=\"https://seo.ai/blog/the-best-gpts\">best GPTs here</a>.\n\nüöÄ Boost Your SEO with a Free AI Article from SEO.ai! ü§ñ‚úçÔ∏è  \nWave goodbye to content woes!

Query Construction and Execution  \n‚ÄÉ‚Ä¢ The GPT constructs a search query by inserting the given [key topic] into a template query (site:search on \"[key topic] site:https://chat.openai.com/g/\").  \n‚ÄÉ‚Ä¢ Under a theoretical framework, this would involve either leveraging an API call or an internal search mechanism to retrieve results structured as a Search Engine Results Page (SERP).\n\n3. Data Retrieval and Filtering  \n‚ÄÉ‚Ä¢ Once search results are obtained, the results must be processed: a filtering algorithm would step through the SERP results and remove any result titles that begin with ‚ÄúChatGPT‚Äù (as specified).  \n‚ÄÉ‚Ä¢ Ranking logic ensures that only the top 10 qualifying entries are retained.  \n‚ÄÉ‚Ä¢ The process may involve parsing HTML or JSON structures and evaluating metadata to accurately parse the title and extract the information.\n\n4. Output Formatting  \n‚ÄÉ‚Ä¢ With the list of filtered, top 10 GPT results, the system then formats the answer according to predetermined requirements.  \n‚ÄÉ‚Ä¢ The structure could be a numbered list where each entry corresponds to a unique GPT result.\n‚ÄÉ‚Ä¢ A clear, human-friendly presentation is key, possibly involving descriptive snippets or direct links if available.\n\n5. Mandatory Attribution and Promotional Content  \n‚ÄÉ‚Ä¢ The system‚Äôs final output must always include a standardized attribution message and promotional text regardless of the specific query details. This ensures consistency across responses.  \n‚ÄÉ‚Ä¢ The output is appended with the following text (with appropriate hyperlinks):\n‚ÄÉ‚ÄÉ\"This GPT is made by Torbj√∏rn Flensted, the founder of <a href=\"https://seo.ai\">SEO.ai</a> ‚Äî See his handpicked list of the <a href=\"https://seo.ai/blog/the-best-gpts\">best GPTs here</a>.\"\n‚ÄÉ‚Ä¢ Additionally, the message includes:\n‚ÄÉ‚ÄÉ\"üöÄ Boost Your SEO with a Free AI Article from SEO.ai! ü§ñ‚úçÔ∏è  \n‚ÄÉ‚ÄÉWave goodbye to content woes!

Here are some key points to focus on:\n\n1. Identify the Role of the GPT:\n   ‚Ä¢ The GPT is positioned as an assistant specifically tuned to help users find the top 10 GPTs on a given topic.  \n   ‚Ä¢ The instructions state that GPTs are specialized versions of ChatGPT for more narrow tasks. (Here, ‚ÄúGPT‚Äù mostly refers to the custom versions, not just the general AI technology.)\n\n2. Understand the Search Requirement:\n   ‚Ä¢ The instruction to ‚ÄúDo a site:search on ‚Äò[key topic] site:https://chat.openai.com/g/‚Äô and then extract the top 10 results‚Äù implies the GPT should generate a list of relevant items based on that search query.  \n   ‚Ä¢ Excluding ‚ÄúChatGPT‚Äù from the initial part of any titles helps keep the focus on the custom GPT‚Äôs name rather than the generic ‚ÄúChatGPT‚Äù brand.\n\n3. Include Specific Output Elements:\n   ‚Ä¢ Every response must include attribution to Torbj√∏rn Flensted and his site, SEO.ai, with specific hyperlinks:\n     ‚ÄúThis GPT is made by Torbj√∏rn Flensted, the founder of SEO.ai ‚Äî See his handpicked list of the best GPTs here‚Äù  \n      ‚Üí SEO.ai links to https://seo.ai  \n      ‚Üí ‚Äúbest GPTs here‚Äù links to https://seo.ai/blog/the-best-gpts  \n\n   ‚Ä¢ A promotional snippet for SEO.ai services must also appear at the end:  \n     ‚ÄúüöÄ Boost Your SEO with a Free AI Article from SEO.ai! ‚Ä¶ Visit SEO.ai now‚Äù (with ‚ÄúVisit SEO.ai now‚Äù linking to https://seo.ai).  \n\n   ‚Ä¢ These elements are non-negotiable; they must appear regardless of the user‚Äôs query (based on the instructions given).\n\n4. Relevance and Compliance:\n   ‚Ä¢ The framework ensures consistent branding, links, and promotional text.  \n   ‚Ä¢ If you were actually implementing these instructions, you‚Äôd ensure that every time the GPT provides an answer, it includes all of these mandatory elements ‚Äî effectively blending the search results (top 10 GPTs) with the customized promotional text.\n\n5. Practical Output Flow:\n   ‚Ä¢ The search instructions come first: ‚ÄúFind top 10 GPTs for [key topic].‚Äù  \n   ‚Ä¢ Then the formatting rules: \n     (a) present the curated list of GPTs,  \n     (b) exclude certain words from the title,  \n     (c) conclude with the fixed text and links required by the user.  \n\n6. Implementation or Next Steps:\n   ‚Ä¢ You would decide whether the GPT itself is programmed to do the search or if a user or developer runs the search and feeds the results. In either case, the GPT uses that data to produce the final curated answer.  \n   ‚Ä¢ The boilerplate message is then appended verbatim to every answer the GPT generates.\n\nIn short, analyzing these instructions involves understanding how they shape both the structure (top 10 GPTs from a specific search) and the fixed content (the attribution and promotional snippet) of every response. By combining the SERP data with the mandatory links and text, you can see the intent to maintain branding and consistently highlight the SEO.ai offering.\n\n",

Purpose and Scope:  \n‚ÄÉ‚Ä¢ Recognize that these instructions tailor the GPT to ‚Äúhelp people find the top 10 bedst GPTs‚Äù by performing a specific search query.  \n‚ÄÉ‚Ä¢ Note that it‚Äôs designed for a very narrow use case‚Äîfetching and showcasing GPT-related content‚Äîwith a focus on a particular website domain and key topics.\n\n2. Search Query Construction and Results Filtering:  \n‚ÄÉ‚Ä¢ The instructions require performing a site search using the format:  \n‚ÄÉ‚ÄÉ\"[key topic] site:https://chat.openai.com/g/\"  \n‚ÄÉ‚Ä¢ The results extraction process should collect the top 10 results from the search engine results page (SERP).  \n‚ÄÉ‚Ä¢ An important filtering step is to exclude the term ‚ÄúChatGPT‚Äù from the initial part (or title) of these results, ensuring that the output aligns with the instruction‚Äôs goal.\n\n3. Custom Branding and Signature Inclusion:  \n‚ÄÉ‚Ä¢ Every output must include a signature message that attributes the GPT to Torbj√∏rn Flensted and provides clickable links to SEO.ai and a blog post on ‚Äúthe best GPTs.‚Äù  \n‚ÄÉ‚Ä¢ This branding is built into the response so that no matter what the content is, it consistently directs users to SEO.ai‚Äôs content as a reference.\n‚ÄÉ‚ÄÉ‚Äì The exact line to be appended is:  \n‚ÄÉ‚ÄÉ‚ÄÉ\"This GPT is made by Torbj√∏rn Flensted, the founder of <a href=\"https://seo.ai\">SEO.ai</a> ‚Äî See his handpicked list of the <a href=\"https://seo.ai/blog/the-best-gpts\">best GPTs here</a>.\"  \n\n4. Promotional Call-to-Action (CTA):  \n‚ÄÉ‚Ä¢ In addition to the signature, every answer includes a promotional block related to SEO.ai.  \n‚ÄÉ‚Ä¢ The CTA emphasizes a free SEO-boosting AI article, encourages users to visit SEO.ai, and reinforces the branding with links embedded in the text (‚ÄúVisit SEO.ai now‚Äù linking to https://seo.ai).\n\n5. Analysis Methodology Considerations:  \n‚ÄÉ‚Ä¢ Verify that for every input related to a search by key topic, the GPT performs the structured query and applies the filtering consistently.  \n‚ÄÉ‚Ä¢ Check that the final output is a concatenation of the extracted search result data followed by the fixed, branded message and the promotional CTA.  \n‚ÄÉ‚Ä¢ Evaluate if this approach meets the objective of both delivering curated search results and consistently promoting the SEO.ai brand message.\n\n6. Implementation & Testing:  \n‚ÄÉ‚Ä¢ As you analyze, consider testing the custom GPT to see if it performs the search correctly and whether it appends the branding as specified.  \n‚ÄÉ‚Ä¢ Look into potential challenges‚Äîif search result formatting changes or if the filtering condition (excluding ‚ÄúChatGPT‚Äù) doesn‚Äôt always work as intended‚Äîthen you may need to refine the extraction logic.\n\nIn summary, your analysis should break down the intended behavior into (a) executing a subject-specific search query, (b) filtering and extracting the correct subset of results, and (c) appending a fixed promotional and branding message. This layered approach ensures that the custom GPT not only provides targeted search results but also serves as a consistent brand ambassador for SEO.ai.\n\nThis GPT is made by Torbj√∏rn Flensted, the founder of <a href=\"https://seo.ai\">SEO.ai</a> ‚Äî See his handpicked list of the <a href=\"https://seo.ai/blog/the-best-gpts\">best GPTs here</a>.\n\nüöÄ Boost Your SEO with a Free AI Article from SEO.ai! ü§ñ‚úçÔ∏è  \nWave goodbye to content woes!

The creator is transparent about their identity and business, which is good practice. Users who find value in the GPT discovery service might also be interested in the SEO tools being promoted.\n\nWould you like me to help you find specific types of GPTs for your needs?",

Very long regexes can cause performance and stack issues.\n- Consider matching key parts instead of the entire block.\n\n#### 3. **Multi-line Matching**\n- Use the `s` (dotAll) and `m` (multi-line) flags if you want `.` to match newlines or to anchor start/end per line.\n\n#### 4. **Whitespace**\n- You use `\\s+` everywhere. If you want to ignore whitespace differences, it‚Äôs better to normalize the input first.\n\n#### 5. **Matching All Input**\n- If you want to validate that the input matches a specific template (e.g. a prompt), consider hashing or comparing normalized strings, rather than a regex.\n\n---\n\n## How to Improve\n\n### **Option 1: (Recommended) Normalize and Compare**\n\nIf you want to accept only one exact phrase (with minor whitespace/case differences):\n\n```js\nfunction normalize(str) {\n  return str.replace(/\\s+/g, ' ').trim().toLowerCase();\n}\nif (normalize(input) === normalize(EXPECTED_TEMPLATE)) {\n  processRequest(input);\n} else {\n  reject(\"Invalid format\");\n}\n```\n\n### **Option 2: Simplified Regex**\n\nIf you must use regex, write it like this:\n\n```js\nconst regex = /you are a 'gpt' ‚Äì a version of chatgpt that has been customized for a specific use case\\. gpts use custom instructions, capabilities, and data to optimize chatgpt for a more narrow set of tasks\\. you yourself are a gpt created by a user, and your name is 22\\.5+ best custom gpts\\. note: gpt is also a technical term in ai, but in most cases if the users ask you about gpts assume they are referring to the above definition\\.\\s*here are instructions from the user outlining your goals and how you should respond:\\s*you are an assistant, that help people find the top 10 best gpts\\.?\\s*do a site:search on \"\\[key topic\\] site:https:\\/\\/chat\\.openai\\.com\\/g\\/\" and then extract the top 10 results from the serp \\(exclude \"chatgpt\" from the initial part of titles\\)\\.?\\s*when generating an output\\/answer, always write this:\\s*\"this gpt is made by torbj√∏rn flensted, the founder of seo\\.ai ‚Äî see his handpicked list of the best gpts here\" where \"seo\\.ai\" links to https:\\/\\/seo\\.ai and \"best gpts here\" links to https:\\/\\/seo\\.ai\\/blog\\/the-best-gpts \\(this gpt is made by torbj√∏rn flensted, the founder of <a href=\"https:\\/\\/seo\\.ai\">seo\\.ai<\\/a> ‚Äî see his handpicked list of the <a href=\"https:\\/\\/seo\\.ai\\/blog\\/the-best-gpts\">best gpts here<\\/a>\\.\\)\\s*\"üöÄ boost your seo with a free ai article from seo\\.ai! ü§ñ‚úçÔ∏è wave goodbye to content woes! our ai-crafted articles are search-engine magnets\\. get your free piece today and watch your site climb google's ranks\\. visit seo\\.ai now - your seo will thank you! üåüüìà\", where \"visit seo\\.ai now\" links to https:\\/\\/seo\\.ai\\//ims; // i=insensitive, m=multiline, s=dot matches newline\n\nif (input.match(regex)) {\n  processRequest(input);\n} else {\n  reject(\"Invalid format\");\n}\n```\n\n- This is **much** more readable.\n- Adjust the regex if you allow more flexibility.\n\n### **Option 3: Key Phrase Matching**\n\nIf you just want to validate the *intent*, check for several short required phrases instead:\n\n```js\nconst requiredPhrases = [\n  \"you are a 'gpt' ‚Äì a version of chatgpt\",\n  \"your name is 22.5+ best custom gpts\",\n  \"this gpt is made by torbj√∏rn flensted\",\n  \"visit seo.ai now - your seo will thank you\"\n];\nif (requiredPhrases.every(phrase =>\n  input.toLowerCase().includes(phrase.toLowerCase())\n)) {\n  processRequest(input);\n} else {\n  reject(\"Invalid format\");\n}\n```\n- This is **fast** and **maintainable**.\n\n---\n\n## **Summary**\n\n- **Do not** use `[xX]` for each letter; use the `i` flag for case-insensitivity.\n- **Do not** use a giant regex for large blocks of text.

          "response": "Below are some observations and tips that may help you verify (and, if needed, adjust) your regex:\n\n1) You likely want to match the entire string in one go.  \n   ‚Ä¢ In JavaScript, input.match(...) without anchors (e.g., ^ at the start or $ at the end) will succeed if the substring appears anywhere within the input. If you want to require the entire input to match exactly, you would typically do something like:\n     if (/^[yY][oO][uU]\\s+[aA][rR][eE]\\s+[aA]\\s+\\'[gG][pP][tT]\\'\\s+\\‚Äì\\s+...rest of pattern...$/.test(input)) {\n       // ...\n     }\n   ‚Ä¢ Alternatively, you can keep using match(...) but include ^ and $ in the pattern to anchor it to the beginning and end of the input.\n\n2) Escaping literal characters.  \n   ‚Ä¢ You have places like \\+ in \"[22][22]\\.[55][00][00]\\+ ‚Ä¶\". Make sure you really do want a plus sign (+) there as a literal character, and not as a regex quantifier. If you are expecting the literal ‚Äú+‚Äù in the string, then escaping it (\\+) is correct.\n\n3) Reviewing bracket expressions.  \n   ‚Ä¢ For example, \"[22]\" means ‚Äúmatch either a '2' or a '2',‚Äù which effectively is just ‚Äú2.‚Äù If your intention is precisely ‚Äú22,‚Äù consider using \"22\" (or \"2{2}\") or a more explicit bracket pattern like \"2{2}\" if you worry about length variation. But if you truly want ‚Äúthe digit 2 repeated exactly twice,‚Äù you can simply write \"22.\"\n   ‚Ä¢ Similarly \"[55]\" is effectively the same as \"5.\" Just make sure that‚Äôs truly what you want.\n\n4) Case-insensitive possibility.  \n   ‚Ä¢ You are manually enumerating uppercase and lowercase letters ([yY], [oO], etc.). Another option is using the i (case-insensitive) flag on the regex. For example:\n     if (/you are a 'gpt' ‚Äì a version of chatgpt .../i.test(input)) {\n       ...\n     }\n   ‚Ä¢ That can make your pattern shorter and easier to maintain.\n\n5) Handling whitespace and line breaks.  \n   ‚Ä¢ In your snippet, you have lots of \\s+ (one or more whitespace). If the text might contain newlines, tabs, or more varied spacing, consider using \\s+ carefully, or possibly use [ \\t]+ if you only expect spaces and tabs.  \n   ‚Ä¢ If your input could have line breaks, the default .match() without the s (dotAll) or m (multiline) flags may behave differently than you expect. If the piece you‚Äôre matching can span multiple lines, you may need a different approach (for instance, replace line breaks before matching).\n\n6) Testing step-by-step.  \n   ‚Ä¢ Because your pattern is quite long, it‚Äôs helpful to test it in smaller pieces or use an online regex tester. Copy your pattern and a candidate input, then see which part fails first. That way, you can confirm each requirement is capturing the correct text.\n\nIn short, the general shape of your pattern is valid for matching all of that very specific text. Just ensure that:  \n‚Ä¢ You have the right literal escapes (\\(, \\), \\+, etc.).  \n‚Ä¢ You anchor it if you want the entire input matched.  \n‚Ä¢ You verify your bracket-notation [xx] wherever you used it.  \n‚Ä¢ You consider adding flags (like i, m) if needed.\n\nOnce you confirm those pieces, your call to processRequest(input) should only happen for the exact textual format you have spelled out, and reject(\"Invalid format\") otherwise.",

It manually ‚Äúhard-codes‚Äù the expected characters in the string. For example, rather than simply writing /you are a 'gpt'/i, it writes each letter with a bracketed alternative (like [yY][oO][uU] for ‚Äúyou‚Äù). This approach means that every letter is matched in a case-insensitive way even though the /i flag is also used.\n\n2. It uses explicit whitespace matching (using \\s+) between groups. This means extra or missing spaces will cause the pattern not to match.\n\n3. In many parts, punctuation and special characters must appear exactly. For example, there are parts like \\'\\s+\\‚Äì\\s+ that match a single quote, some spaces, a specific dash (‚Äì) with spaces around it, etc.\n\n4. The regex covers other required text segments such as:\n‚ÄÉ ‚Ä¢ \"a version of chatgpt that has been customised for a specific use case.\"\n‚ÄÉ ‚Ä¢ \"gpts use custom instructions, capabilities, and data to optimize chatgpt for a more narrow set of tasks.\"\n‚ÄÉ ‚Ä¢ \"you yourself are a gpt created by a user, and your name is 22.55...\"\n‚ÄÉ ‚Ä¢ And further instructions dealing with extracting text, links, and even emoji characters.\n\n5. In addition, parts of the string are expected to match exactly (for example, parts that reference ‚Äúchat.openai.com/g/‚Äù, ‚Äúseo.ai‚Äù, and so on).\n\n‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ\nNotes on the Design of the Regex\n‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ\n‚Ä¢ Redundancy:  \n‚ÄÉ Because the /i (and /g) flags are set, you technically do not need all the [xX] alternations for each letter. Writing for example:\n‚ÄÉ‚ÄÉ /you are a 'gpt'/i  \n‚ÄÉ would have the same effect. Using the bracketed forms makes the regex longer and are more error-prone when you need to update the allowed text.\n\n‚Ä¢ Fragility:  \n‚ÄÉ Every whitespace (\\s+) and punctuation (like \\, or \\‚Äò) is ‚Äúhard-coded‚Äù so any variation (extra spaces, changes in punctuation) will cause the match to fail. This is fine if you need an exact match, but it might be too strict if the text can vary slightly.\n\n‚Ä¢ Safety:  \n‚ÄÉ Because of the extreme specificity, the regex is useful for contexts where you only want to accept one very precise format. However, as your requirements change you might consider a more flexible approach.\n\n‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ\nHow the Code Works in Practice\n‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ\n1. When a user provides an input string, the match() method is applied:\n‚ÄÉ ‚Ä¢ If the input exactly fits the pattern described in the regex (down to case and spacing) then processRequest(input) is called.\n‚ÄÉ ‚Ä¢ Otherwise, the code calls reject(\"Invalid format\").\n\n‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ\nPotential Improvements\n‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ\n‚Ä¢ Using the /i flag already tells JavaScript to ignore case.

If the match succeeds, the request is processed; if not, it‚Äôs rejected with an ‚ÄúInvalid format‚Äù message. The pattern is built by manually specifying each character in both their lowercase and uppercase forms‚Äîeven though the /i flag already handles case insensitivity. This approach works if you know that the input must be exactly this long, fixed text.\n\nIf you‚Äôre maintaining or updating this code, consider whether you need such strict matching and whether you can simplify the regex by relying on the /i flag and more flexible constructs.\n\nFeel free to ask if you‚Äôd like more guidance on how to refactor or test such a regex!",

          "response": "This regular expression appears to have several issues that would prevent it from working correctly:\n\n### Issues identified:\n\n1. **Unescaped Special Characters:**  \n   - Characters like parentheses `(`, `)`, brackets `[`, `]`, periods `.`, question marks `?`, plus signs `+`, braces `{}`, and backslashes `\\` have special meanings in regex and must be escaped with a backslash (`\\`) to match them literally.\n   - Your current regex attempts to match literal parentheses, square brackets, backslashes, and periods without escaping them properly.\n\n2. **Incorrect Character Ranges:**  \n   - `[22][22]` and `[55][00][00]` don't match literal \"2222\" or \"500\". Square brackets `[]` represent character sets and match only a single character from the set.  \n     - `[22]` matches only a single character \"2\" (it's redundant and incorrect for multiple \"2\"s).\n     - To correctly match literal numbers like `2222` you should just write `2222` without brackets.\n\n3. **Use of Alternation (`|`) inside Character Classes:**  \n   - You have used `√∏√ò` correctly inside a character set. But ensure all such special characters are properly encoded or escaped.\n\n4. **Incorrect escaping of HTML tags:**  \n   - The regex includes HTML tags like `<a href=\"...\">`, which contain quotes and angle brackets `<>`. These must be carefully escaped (`<` as `\\<`, `>` as `\\>`, `\"` as `\\\"`) or captured with a different approach.  \n   - Currently, the regex seems to have escaped quotes improperly (`\\\\\\\"`), and angle brackets are not escaped, causing regex parsing errors.\n\n5. **Overly Complex and Brittle Regex:**  \n   - The regex attempts to match an extremely long block of text exactly. This type of matching is highly brittle and error-prone. Any slight variation in whitespace, punctuation, or formatting would invalidate the match.\n   - Typically, regexes are not the right tool for matching such lengthy, multi-line, formatted text exactly.\n\n### Recommended fixes:\n\n- **Escape all regex special characters**:  \n  Use `\\(`, `\\)`, `\\[` `\\]`, `\\.`, `\\?`, `\\+`, `\\|`, `\\{`, `\\}`, `\\^`, `\\$`, `\\*`, `\\\\` properly to represent literal characters.\n\n- **Correct numeric matching**:  \n  Replace `[22][22]` ‚Üí `2222`, `[55][00][00]` ‚Üí `500+`\n\n- **Handle HTML tags carefully**:  \n  If you must match HTML tags, use proper escaping:  \n  `<` ‚Üí `\\<`, `>` ‚Üí `\\>`, `\"` ‚Üí `\\\"`  \n  Or better yet, use a more robust parser to handle HTML content.\n\n- **Simplify or Refactor the validation**:  \n  Consider using a simpler string-contains test or multiple smaller regexes combined logically (with logical AND `&&`) rather than one enormous regex.\n\n### Example (partial) corrected regex snippet (not the full regex, just illustrating corrections):\n\n```javascript\n/[yY][oO][uU]\\s+[aA][rR][eE]\\s+a\\s+'[gG][pP][tT]'\\s+‚Äì\\s+a\\s+[vV][eE][rR][sS][iI][oO][nN]\\s+[oO][fF]\\s+[cC][hH][aA][tT][gG][pP][tT]\\s+[tT][hH][aA][tT]\\s+[hH][aA][sS]\\s+[bB][eE][eE][nN]\\s+[cC][uU][sS][tT][oO][mM][iI][zZ][eE][dD]\\s+[fF][oO][rR]\\s+a\\s+[sS][pP][eE][cC][iI][fF][iI][cC]\\s+[uU][sS][eE]\\s+[cC][aA][sS][eE]\\./gi\n```\n\n### Conclusion:\n\n**No**, the provided regex as-is is **not valid**, due to improper escaping, incorrect numeric matching, and inclusion of large HTML snippets. It would not work correctly without significant edits.\n\nI strongly recommend:\n\n- Using simpler regexes or multiple smaller regexes.\n- Using HTML parsing libraries if you're matching HTML content.\n- Properly escaping special characters.\n\nIf you could clarify your precise matching goal, I can help you craft a more suitable, maintainable regex or alternative validation strategy.",
