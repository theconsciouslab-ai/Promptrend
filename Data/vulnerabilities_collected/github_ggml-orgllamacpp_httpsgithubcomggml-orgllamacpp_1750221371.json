          "response": "Your observations are very insightful and point toward differences in how llama-cli and llama-server handle system prompts.\n\n### Analysis\n\n**1. Default System Prompt in llama-cli:**  \n- llama-cli (the command-line interface) typically has its own way to set or include a system prompt, and often includes some reasonable default if none is provided.\n- When you run llama-cli without specifying a system prompt, it may inject a default prompt or simply work as expected.\n\n**2. Default System Prompt in llama-server:**  \n- llama-server, depending on its configuration and implementation, might behave differently.\n- In your case, if the \"System Message\" field is empty or contains only a generic prompt like \"you are helpful assistant,\" the output is \"garbage\" (i.e., not useful or formatted as you want).\n- When you use a **detailed, structured system message** (with instructions and required output formatting), it works correctly.\n\n**3. The Role of the System Prompt:**  \n- Modern LLMs are heavily influenced by the initial system prompt. If the system prompt is too generic or empty, the model might not understand the context, expected behavior, or output formatting.\n- Your third prompt explicitly instructs the model on how to format its reasoning and answer, leading to the correct output.\n\n### Conclusion\n\n- **llama-cli** may have a built-in default system prompt, or it may just work better with minimal prompting, depending on its implementation and how it wraps the model's API.\n- **llama-server** requires a more explicit system message to function correctly, especially with custom output formatting.\n\n### Recommendations\n\n1. **Always Provide a Detailed System Message in llama-server:**  \n   Since llama-server depends on the system message for context and output formatting, always include your detailed system message for consistent results.\n\n2. **Check Server Defaults:**  \n   Look into the llama-server configuration or documentation to see if you can set a global default system message, or if you can modify its code to provide a fallback default.\n\n3. **Compare Versions:**  \n   There may be differences in the versions or builds of llama.cpp, llama-cli, and llama-server you are using. Updating to the latest versions may improve consistency.\n\n4. **Submit Feedback:**  \n   If this behavior is undesirable, consider submitting an issue or feature request to the llama-server maintainers to include a reasonable default system prompt.\n\n### TL;DR\n\nYes, it appears that llama-cli has a reasonable default system prompt or handles empty prompts better, while llama-server needs an explicit, detailed system message for correct behavior—especially with custom output formatting. This is likely due to differences in how they handle (or fail to handle) empty or generic prompts.\n\nIf you want llama-server to work like llama-cli, always provide a detailed system message, or look into configuring a default at the server level.",

In llama-cli, a default system prompt is likely included if you do not supply one or leave it empty. Meanwhile, llama-server may disable or omit the system prompt entirely if it’s blank, causing “garbage” or empty results. \n\nIf you do want consistent outputs in llama-server, you generally need to supply a well-formed system prompt in its configuration. One workaround is to replicate the same prompt that llama-cli uses by default (e.g., “You are a helpful assistant…”).

          "response": "The core issue isn’t that llama-server “doesn’t support” a default system prompt—instead, it’s about how the system prompt is used and what instructions it provides. Let me explain:\n\n• In llama-cli the built‐in default system prompt (or the behavior when no explicit prompt is given) is crafted so that the model “knows” how to handle questions in a particular way. That default likely contains more detailed instructions (or “priming”) than what you typed manually as \"you are a helpful assistant\". Essentially, the CLI version injects a richer context behind the scenes.\n\n• In llama-server, if you leave the “System Message” field empty it’s disabled. If you fill it with a barebones prompt like “you are helpful assistant,” the server is only feeding that short instruction to the model. In your case that resulted in “garbage” output because the instructions are insufficient to guide the model towards producing the desired structured output.  \n \n• When you supply the longer, formatted system prompt (with the <think></think> and <answer></answer> tags) you are being very explicit about how to process the input. As a result, the model produces output that fits your expectations.\n\nSo, in effect, with llama-cli the default prompt (or the hidden instructions) “comes for free” even if you don’t explicitly set one, while llama-server disables the system prompt when left empty and requires you to provide a detailed one if you want that behavior. \n\nShort answer: Yes—you can effectively use the default behavior with llama-cli (because it includes an internal default prompt) but in llama-server you must supply a complete system prompt (with all the reasoning/instruction details) to get comparable results.",

The server seems to require a more detailed and structured system message to function correctly.\n\nThe fact that the longer, more specific prompt works suggests that llama-server might need more explicit instructions on how to format its responses and what role to assume. This could be due to differences in how the server processes and interprets the system message compared to the CLI version.\n\nTo use llama-server effectively, you may need to:\n\n1. Use a more detailed system message that clearly defines the assistant's role and response format.\n2. Experiment with different system message structures to find what works best with the server.\n3. Consider reaching out to the developers or checking the documentation for llama-server to see if there are specific requirements or recommendations for system messages.\n\nIf you need to use a simpler system message, you might need to stick with llama-cli for those use cases, or investigate if there are configuration options in llama-server that can make it behave more like the CLI version.\n</answer>",

The llama-cli might be more lenient or have additional processing steps to handle the system message, whereas the llama-server might be more strict in its interpretation.\n\n2. **Server Configuration**: There might be some server-specific settings or configurations that are affecting the way the system message is interpreted.

Your model appears to expect structured output with specific formatting (the `<think>` and `<answer>` tags)\n\n## Why Your Long System Message Works\n\nYour detailed system message works because it:\n- Provides clear instructions about the expected output format\n- Gives the model context about its role\n- Specifies the exact structure you want (`<think>` and `<answer>` tags)\n\n## Solutions\n\n**Option 1: Use a simpler but complete system message**\n```\nYou are a helpful assistant. Provide clear, accurate responses to user questions.\n```\n\n**Option 2: Check your model's recommended system prompt**\n- Different models (Llama 2, Llama 3, Code Llama, etc.) often have specific recommended system prompts\n- Check the model card or documentation for the specific model you're using\n\n**Option 3: Server configuration**\n- Some llama-server implementations have additional parameters like `--chat-template` that might help\n- Check if your server has options for default prompting behavior\n\n**Option 4: Add basic structure without the tags**\n```\nYou are a helpful assistant.

Let’s clarify and answer your question step by step:\n\n<think>\nYou're asking about llama-server and llama-cli, specifically regarding the use of the system prompt (system message) and how to ensure proper behavior—especially when the system message is empty or not set. You mention that in the server settings, the \"System\" field is editable, and if left empty, the assistant output is either garbage or empty, which is undesired. You want a setup where, even if the system message is empty, the assistant still works correctly (for example, defaults to being a helpful assistant). You're also interested in how to structure prompt templates, possibly using tags like <think> and <answer> for reasoning and answers.\n</think>\n\n<answer>\nllama-server and llama-cli both allow you to specify a \"system\" prompt which guides the assistant's behavior (e.g., \"You are a helpful assistant\"). If the system message is left empty, some models or prompt templates may not handle this gracefully, resulting in poor or nonsensical output.\n\n**To ensure correct behavior:**\n\n- In llama-server:  \n  - The \"System\" field in server settings should contain a default instruction, such as \"You are a helpful assistant.\"  \n  - If you want the assistant to work well even if this is left empty, you should ensure your prompt template always provides a fallback, or that the backend code inserts a default system prompt when the field is empty.\n\n- In llama-cli:  \n  - You can specify the system message with a command-line flag (e.g., --system \"You are a helpful assistant\"). If not provided, check if your prompt template or the underlying code supplies a sensible default.\n\n**Regarding prompt templates and tags (<think>, <answer>):**\n\n- Some prompt templates separate the assistant's reasoning from its answer using tags like <think> and <answer>.\n- Example:\n  ```\n  <think>\n  [Assistant’s internal reasoning here]\n  </think>\n  <answer>\n  [Final answer provided to user here]\n  </answer>\n  ```\n- Make sure your model and prompt template support and understand these tags. Not all models do by default; some need to be fine-tuned or prompted properly to use this structure.\n\n**Summary:**\n- Always provide a default system prompt (\"You are a helpful assistant\") in llama-server and llama-cli for best results.\n- If you use <think> and <answer> tags, ensure your prompt template and model are designed to use them.\n- If the system message is empty and you get garbage output, set a default instruction or modify the server code to insert one automatically.\n\nLet me know if you need example prompt templates or configuration settings!\n</answer>",

Let's break down what's likely happening:\n\n### Observations\n\n1. **Short or Empty System Message:**  \n   - System message like \"you are helpful assistant\" or empty → Output is \"garbage\" (nonsensical or unhelpful).\n\n2. **Long, Structured System Message:**  \n   - System message with explicit instructions and tags → Output is as expected.\n\n3. **llama-cli works with default prompt, llama-server doesn't:**  \n   - You can use a simple/default prompt with llama-cli, but with llama-server, you need the structured prompt for correct output.\n\n---\n\n## Reasoning\n\n<think>\nThe behavior suggests that **llama-server** is more sensitive to the format and content of the system message than **llama-cli**. This can be due to several factors:\n\n- **Prompt Formatting:** llama-server may require explicit instructions or formatting cues to correctly parse and handle input/output, especially with certain API or chat backends.\n- **System Message Injection:** llama-server might pass the system message in a way that affects how the model interprets subsequent user input. If the system message is too short or missing, the model lacks necessary context or formatting cues, leading to poor output.\n- **Default Prompt Differences:** llama-cli may have built-in defaults or additional logic to handle minimal or missing system messages, whereas llama-server expects you to provide the full prompt context.\n\nIn short, **llama-server needs a well-structured system prompt** to guide model behavior, or else its output is unpredictable.\n</think>\n\n---\n\n## Answer\n\n<answer>\nYes, based on your testing, you can use the default (short or empty) system prompt with **llama-cli**, but **llama-server** requires a more detailed, structured system message to function correctly. This is likely due to differences in how each tool handles prompt formatting and context injection to the model. For academic purposes, when using llama-server, always provide a clear, explicit system message to ensure reliable output.\n</answer>",

          "response": "It sounds like llama-cli and llama-server each handle the “system prompt” differently. Many LLM frontends or wrappers have default system messages or additional context (e.g., instructions, role definitions) that they send to the model automatically. If llama-cli comes with a built-in default system prompt while llama-server does not—or if llama-server requires an explicit prompt to function properly—this could explain why leaving it empty or setting it to “You are a helpful assistant” causes undesirable output in one case but not in the other.\n\nHere are a few ideas to consider:\n\n1. Check the Default Prompt Behavior\n   • Verify how llama-cli sets its default system message. In some tools, there is a hidden or implicit system prompt that is always included unless you override it.  \n   • Compare that with llama-server’s documented behavior. Some server implementations require you to provide the entire system prompt or they may disable the system prompt path completely if the field is left empty.\n\n2. Configuration Differences\n   • Look into any configuration files, environment variables, or command-line parameters for llama-server to see if there is an option enabling or disabling the default prompt.  \n   • Check for any differences between the two tools that might inject extra text or omit it depending on how a parameter is passed.\n\n3. Prompt Format Requirements\n   • The fact that the message “You are a helpful assistant. To answer the user’s question…” worked correctly suggests llama-server might need a specific style or format to parse the prompt.  \n   • If the system needs certain tags or expects certain keywords, an overly simple prompt (like “You are a helpful assistant”) might not give it enough context, resulting in poor output.\n\n4. Experiment and Compare\n   • Try replicating the exact command-line call and environment for llama-cli and llama-server to confirm whether the difference is in the prompt itself or in how the prompt is being passed to the model.  \n   • If possible, examine the logs or debug outputs to see the exact system message each tool sends to the model.\n\nIn short, it’s quite possible that the default system message is handled automatically by llama-cli but not by llama-server. Ensuring both environments feed the same text to the model is the key. You might need to configure llama-server explicitly with a more detailed or properly formatted system message to match llama-cli behavior.",

In your tests, only when you supply a very explicit system prompt (one that even instructs the assistant to provide its “reasoning process” within specific tags) does the output appear as expected, while the default (empty or very short) prompt leads to “garbage” output.\n\nThere are a few possible explanations for this:\n\n1. Implementation differences: The llama-cli and llama-server applications might be handling the system (or “context”) prompt differently. For example, llama-server could be programmed or configured so that an empty or short system prompt either doesn’t override its internal defaults or is treated in a way that limits the proper initialization of context, whereas llama-cli might be more forgiving or may have a different default built in.\n\n2. Prompt injection or overruling defaults: Some server implementations are designed to prevent “prompt injections” or unintended changes to the behavior by enforcing a stricter system prompt. This could mean that when left empty or with a minimal message, the server-side settings cause an unexpected state, resulting in output that appears “garbage” or off-target.\n\n3. Explicit instructions help clarify behavior: When you provide the complete system message—detailing not only that the assistant should be helpful but also how to structure its responses—the model is given a clear framework in which to operate. This explicit instruction may override some of the server’s internal handling and ensure that the reasoning and answer parts are clearly formatted. The llama-server might therefore rely more strongly on the system message to set its “chain of thought” or internal functioning, while the cli may have a fallback for when no detailed instruction is provided.\n\n4. Security or configuration constraints: Since your work is described as part of a security assessment, it’s also possible that the differences are due to some additional security auditing along the server path—either via middleware or inherent to the server’s design—that deliberately rejects or modifies “default” system messages to reduce the risk of abuse. This kind of design can appear as if only a very specific override (that explicit system message format) works as expected.\n\nIn summary, it does seem from your academic tests that the default system prompt (especially when empty) might work “differently” or not as expected with llama-server compared to llama-cli. This could be due to differences in configuration, internal default handling, or even built-in safety measures. However, further controlled experiments and a review of the source or documentation for both llama-cli and llama-server would be needed to determine the exact cause.",

          "response": "It appears that the observed behavior arises due to the need for structured prompt formatting when interacting with certain models (such as Llama-based models) through llama-server versus llama-cli.\n\n### Reason why this happens:\n\n- **Prompt Format Dependency:**  \n  Llama models (and similar open-source models) typically require specific prompt structures or templates to reliably produce useful outputs. When using llama-cli, the CLI tool itself commonly applies default formatting or templates automatically, ensuring the model receives prompts in the expected structured format.\n\n- **Explicit Prompting in llama-server:**  \n  The llama-server generally does not automatically apply a default prompting format, so you must explicitly provide structure through the system message or your input prompt. If the system message is too minimal (\"you are helpful assistant\") or left empty, the model receives ambiguous or unstructured instructions, causing it to output \"garbage\" or nonsensical text.\n\n- **Structured Prompt (Explicitly Specified):**  \n  When you explicitly define the detailed structured prompt:\n  ```\n  \"You are a helpful assistant. To answer the user's question, you first think about the reasoning process and then provide the user with the answer. The reasoning process and answer are enclosed within <think> </think> and <answer> </answer> tags, respectively, i.e., <think> reasoning process here </think> <answer> answer here </answer>.\"\n  ```\n  you provide clear guidance on how to structure the response, causing the model to behave as expected.\n\n### Practical Implication:\n\n- **llama-cli:** Usually handles default formatting internally, thus minimal or even empty prompts may still yield reasonable results.\n- **llama-server:** Requires explicit prompting and formatting, ensuring the model can properly parse and respond.\n\n### Recommendations for your Assessment:\n\n- Always explicitly define structured prompts when using llama-server.\n- If you wish to replicate llama-cli behavior with llama-server, extract the default prompt template from llama-cli and reuse it explicitly within the llama-server configuration.\n- Clearly document the prompt format required by llama-server to ensure consistent behavior and avoid confusion.\n\nIn summary, the difference you're observing is expected and due to llama-server requiring explicit prompting structure.",

          "response": "You're noticing a difference in behavior between **llama-cpp-cli** (the command-line interface) and **llama-s3rver** (the HTTP server) when it comes to using system prompts (system messages). This is a common source of confusion, and here's what is likely happening:\n\n### 1. System Prompt Handling Differences\n\n- **llama-cpp-cli** (or llama-cli):  \n  Usually, when you invoke the model via CLI, it prepends your system prompt (if any) to the prompt you pass, and the model will use that as part of the context for its response. Many community UIs and clients do this in a simple, direct way.\n\n- **llama-s3rver**:  \n  The HTTP server implementation may treat the system message differently. Some server implementations:\n  - **Skip** the system message if it's empty.\n  - **Don't include** any system message unless you explicitly provide one.\n  - **May require** a more explicit formatting (e.g., special tokens or tags).\n\n### 2. Why Garbage Output?\n\n- If you provide a very minimal system message (e.g., just \"you are a helpful assistant\"), the model might not be \"steered\" enough, resulting in incoherent or generic output.\n- If the field is empty, depending on the server's implementation, it might:\n  - Not send any system/context at all, leading the model to produce \"garbage\" because it has no instruction or role to follow.\n  - Misconstruct the prompt, especially if your frontend expects a system message.\n\n- When you provide a **detailed system message** with explicit instructions (e.g., about using `<think>` and `<answer>` tags), the model is much more likely to behave as expected—the structure helps guide its output.\n\n### 3. Default Prompts and Compatibility\n\n- **llama-cpp-cli** may have a built-in or default system prompt if none is given (or automatically prepends something).\n- **llama-s3rver** may not, or the default might be `''` (empty string), leading to problems if your workflow depends on a system prompt being present.\n\n### 4. What To Do\n\n1. **Always provide a system prompt** in your server settings, at least something like:\n   ```\n   You are a helpful assistant.\n   ```\n   But, as you observed, more detailed instructions yield better results.\n\n2. **Check your frontend/client:**  \n   If your frontend expects a certain structure (e.g., expects answers between `<answer></answer>`), your system prompt must tell the model to do that.\n\n3. **Compare server logs:**  \n   Look at the prompt actually sent to the model in both CLI and server modes. There may be differences in how the prompt is constructed.\n\n4. **Consult documentation:**  \n   Some servers (like **llama.cpp**'s `server` mode) let you specify a default system prompt or template—check if your server supports this.\n\n### 5. Summary Table\n\n| Mode              | System Prompt Needed? | Default Provided? | Output if Empty |\n|-------------------|----------------------|-------------------|-----------------|\n| llama-cpp-cli     | Recommended          | Sometimes         | Often generic/garbage |\n| llama-s3rver      | Usually required     | Rarely            | Garbage/undefined    |\n\n---\n\n## Recommendation\n\n- **Always set a system message** in server mode, especially if you rely on output formatting.\n- If you want CLI and server to behave the same, make sure the system prompt is always set and formatted identically.\n\n---\n\nIf you want more technical specifics, let me know which server (exact repo or version) you use, and I can help find the exact place to set the system prompt!",

          "response": "It sounds like you’ve discovered that the two implementations (llama‑cli versus llama‑server) handle the “system message” differently. In your tests, when you leave the system message empty or use a very minimal prompt (like “you are a helpful assistant”), the llama‑server version produces “garbage” output, whereas the more detailed system prompt (with the explicit tagging instructions for <think> and <answer>) works as expected. Meanwhile, with llama‑cli you can apparently use your default system prompt without trouble.\n\nThere are a few potential reasons for this discrepancy:\n\n1. Different defaults or fallback behavior:\n • Some implementations (or CLI wrappers) may have a built‑in “default system prompt” if the field is left empty or if the prompt is too short. The server version may not automatically insert a default, so when the system message is empty or minimal it fails to guide the model, leading to unexpected (“garbage”) output.\n • The llama‑cli might be adding a default context internally that the server version does not.\n\n2. Parsing and formatting differences:\n • The detailed system prompt that tells the assistant to “first think about the reasoning process” and to enclose the reasoning and answer within specific tags (<think>…</think> and <answer>…</answer>) might be parsed correctly by llama‑cli but not by llama‑server if the latter does not activate system prompts when the field is empty.\n • It’s also possible that the server’s handling of formatting instructions (or its internal organization of prompts) differs from the client version.\n\n3. Implementation or configuration bugs:\n • There might be a bug or a configuration setting on the server side that effectively “disables” or ignores a system message that is empty or not sufficiently instructive. Some implementations may require that the system prompt not be empty in order to function properly.\n\nWhat can you do?\n• If you want consistent behavior with llama‑server, be sure always to provide a non‑empty system prompt. That seems to be the crux of the issue.\n• Use the more detailed prompt (like the one with the <think> and <answer> tags) if that is what produces acceptable output.\n• Double‑check the server configuration or documentation—there might be notes regarding the expected behavior of an empty system message field or how to override the defaults.\n\nShort answer: Yes, based on your observations it appears that while the llama‑cli can use a default system prompt if you leave the field empty (or with a basic “you are helpful assistant” string), the llama‑server requires a properly detailed system prompt (like the one that instructs the step‑by‑step reasoning with <think> and <answer> tags).

Let's break down what's happening:\n\n## 1. **System Message: \"you are helpful assistant\"**\n- **Behavior:** Output is garbage.\n- **Reason:** This is a very minimal prompt. Some LLMs (including Llama and OpenAI models) often need more explicit, structured system messages to set behavior. If the model isn't \"primed\" with enough context, it may produce low-quality or incoherent outputs, especially in some server settings.\n\n## 2. **System Message: (empty)**\n- **Behavior:** Output is garbage.\n- **Reason:** With no system message, the model has no context or instructions, so it might not know how to respond and can generate unpredictable or irrelevant responses.\n\n## 3. **System Message:**\n    ```\n    You are a helpful assistant. To answer the user's question, you first think about the reasoning process and then provide the user with the answer. The reasoning process and answer are enclosed within <think> </think> and <answer> </answer> tags, respectively, i.e., <think> reasoning process here </think> <answer> answer here </answer>.\n    ```\n- **Behavior:** It works correctly.\n- **Reason:** This is a detailed, explicit system instruction. It tells the model exactly what to do, including the output format. Modern LLMs perform much better with clear, structured instructions.\n\n---\n\n## Why does llama-cli work with the default prompt, but llama-server does not?\n\n**llama-cli** and **llama-server** may use different default prompts or handle the system message differently. For example:\n- **llama-cli** might inject its own \"You are a helpful assistant\" (or similar) message even if none is provided, or it might have a better default prompt structure.\n- **llama-server** may strictly use only what you provide in the \"System Message\" field and send it as-is to the model, resulting in no context if left blank or minimal context if too short.\n\n**In summary:**\n- Llama models (and most LLMs) work best with explicit and structured system prompts.\n- Minimal or empty system prompts often result in poor output.\n- The difference in behavior between llama-cli and llama-server is likely due to how each handles defaults and the system message.\n\n---\n\n## What should you do?\n\n- **Always provide an explicit, structured system prompt in llama-server.**\n- If you want llama-server to behave like llama-cli, try to find out what system prompt llama-cli uses by default and copy it into your server settings.\n- For best results, use a prompt similar to the one you found works well (the one with <think> and <answer> tags).\n\n---\n\n**TL;DR:**  \nYes, the default system prompt that works in llama-cli may not work in llama-server if llama-server requires a more explicit prompt or if its defaults are different.

In general:\n\n• llama-cli typically allows you to pass a system prompt (a.k.a. “pre-prompt”) at runtime with a command-line option or configuration flag, often guaranteeing that each user query is prefixed correctly.  \n• llama-server implementations vary. Some automatically prepend a system prompt to each conversation, others rely on an external configuration file or environment variable, and still others do not include the system prompt unless the user explicitly sends it as part of the conversation.\n\nSo you may well see different behaviors across the two tools, especially regarding how they use or ignore that “System Message” field. If llama-server is ignoring your custom system prompt, you will likely see “garbage” (an unconditioned or poorly prompted reply). A few suggestions to fix this:\n\n1) Check how llama-server expects a system (or “pre”) prompt. It may need a specific command-line argument or you might need to insert the message in its config.  \n2) Make sure that llama-server is not overriding your custom prompt with its own default or clearing it out if empty.  \n3) If there’s a UI for llama-server (like a web or REST interface), be sure that you’re populating the system prompt field in a way that the server acknowledges.  \n4) If you have direct access to the llama-server code, confirm the logic in the “prompt-building” or “system prompt injection” portion of the code is including your custom text.\n\nHence, it’s not that you “can’t use” the default system prompt on llama-server; more likely, it is just not actually consuming the system prompt you specify.

In llama-server the explicit system message field is used for that purpose; if you leave it empty or give it only a very short message like “you are helpful assistant,” the instructions aren’t complete enough (or aren’t interpreted properly) so that the model ends up “spewing” output that looks like garbage.\n\nWhen you supply a more complete system prompt—in your case the one that not only says “you are a helpful assistant” but also instructs the model to format its answer with a chain-of-thought (using the <think> and <answer> tags)—the server behaves the way you expect.

Let me clarify what's happening and how you can address it:\n\n### Why this happens:\n\n- **llama-cli** typically adds a default system prompt internally (like \"You are a helpful assistant.\") if no explicit system message is specified.  \n- **llama-server (e.g., llama.cpp's web server)** often does **not** automatically include a default system prompt, or it may differ in prompt structure and formatting. In llama-server, if the \"System Message\" is left empty, the model may receive an incomplete or improperly formatted prompt, leading to garbage outputs.\n\n### Why the third prompt works correctly:\n\n- The third prompt you provided explicitly instructs the model to think step-by-step and clearly defines the desired output format (using `<think>` and `<answer>` tags). This explicit and structured prompt helps the model understand exactly what's expected, significantly improving output quality.\n- Without clear instructions, certain models (particularly llama-based models) may produce noisy or undesirable outputs.\n\n### How to properly handle this:\n\nIf you want llama-server to behave similarly to llama-cli, you should explicitly specify a clear and structured default system prompt in llama-server settings:\n\nFor instance, you could use something like:\n\n```\nYou are a helpful assistant. Provide clear, accurate, and concise answers to the user's queries.\n```\n\nor the more structured prompt you already found works well:\n\n```\nYou are a helpful assistant.

The reasoning process and answer are enclosed within <think> </think> and <answer> </answer> tags, respectively, i.e., <think> reasoning process here </think> <answer> answer here </answer>.\n```\n\n### Conclusion and Recommendation:\n\n- **llama-cli** often includes default prompts internally, resulting in decent outputs without explicit configuration.\n- **llama-server** expects the user to specify explicit prompts and does not automatically include a useful default prompt.\n- **Therefore, explicitly setting a proper, structured system message in llama-server is necessary for consistent, high-quality results.**\n\nIn short: Yes, you can use the default system prompt with llama-cli without explicitly specifying it, but llama-server requires explicitly setting the system prompt for good outputs.",

          "response": "You're observing different behaviors between **llama-cli** and **llama-server** when setting the system message (system prompt), and it seems that only a very explicit system prompt (with instructions about <think> and <answer> tags) works reliably in **llama-server**. Let's break down why this might be happening:\n\n## 1. System Message Handling Differences\n\n### llama-cli\n- **llama-cli** (the command-line interface) typically sends your input directly to the model with a single prompt string.\n- By default, it might prepend a simple system prompt (e.g., \"You are a helpful assistant.\") or let you specify your own.\n- It tends to be more permissive or expects the model to \"know what to do\" with a default or empty system prompt.\n\n### llama-server\n- **llama-server** is designed for API-style interactions (like OpenAI's API), and may implement more complex prompt formatting, including role-based messages (system, user, assistant).\n- Some llama-server implementations use \"chat templates\" (see [llama.cpp chat templates](https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp/blob/master/examples/chat/README.md)), which format the conversation differently depending on the system prompt and role messages.\n\n## 2. Why does the detailed system prompt work?\n\nWhen you supply a very explicit system prompt (\"You are a helpful assistant... use <think> and <answer>...\"), you're **priming** the model to structure its output strictly, regardless of server/client, because you're giving it exact instructions in the system message.\n\nWhen you leave the system message blank or too simple, the server and/or template may not format the prompt in a way that the model \"understands\" what you want, resulting in \"garbage\" output.\n\n## 3. Default System Prompts Aren't Always Equivalent\n\n- The default system prompt in llama-cli might be handled differently (or not at all), while llama-server might require a more explicit, structured system prompt to function correctly.\n- The chat template used by llama-server may not provide enough context with a blank or generic system prompt, especially if the model wasn't fine-tuned with those templates.\n\n## 4. Solutions\n\n- **Always use a specific, structured system prompt** in llama-server, especially if you need particular formatting in the output.\n- Explore the **chat template** settings in your llama-server configuration. Some servers let you customize how messages are formatted. Ensuring the template matches what the model expects can help.\n- If you want llama-server to behave like llama-cli, try to replicate the prompt formatting of llama-cli in your server's configuration.\n\n## 5. TL;DR\n\n- **llama-cli** and **llama-server** may format prompts differently.\n- **llama-server** may require a more explicit system prompt (like your <think>/<answer> instruction) for reliable, structured output.\n- This is likely due to differences in how chat templates and system prompts are handled internally.\n- Check your server's documentation for chat template customization if you want to fine-tune the behavior.\n\n## References\n- [llama.cpp chat template documentation](https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp/blob/master/examples/chat/README.md)\n- [llama-server issues and discussions](https://github.com/abetlen/llama-cpp-python/issues?q=system+prompt)\n\n**If you want to provide more details (e.g., which server implementation, configuration files, or model version), I can help you further tailor the advice!**",

While both use the underlying LLaMA models, they typically have slightly different “prompt pipelines.”\n\n1. llama‑cli:  \n   • Usually takes one combined prompt stream (e.g. “System” + “User” content) and feeds that directly to the model.  \n   • If it has a default system prompt at all, it generally merges every piece of content (system, user, internal instructions) into a single text string before sending it to the model.\n\n2. llama‑server:  \n   • Often tries to structure the conversation as separate roles—“system,” “user,” “assistant,” etc.—and uses additional logic or settings (like the “System Message (will be disabled if left empty)” field) to decide how to piece everything together.  \n   • If that field is empty, or if the text is too short (e.g. “You are a helpful assistant”), the server might supply no system-guiding instructions to the model at all. In many models, providing too little or too vague a system prompt can cause less coherent or “garbage” outputs.\n\nWhen you provide a more elaborate system message (e.g., instructing the model to put its reasoning in <think> tags and the final output in <answer> tags), you are essentially replacing default prompting logic with your own. That extra context seems to help the server version generate coherent outputs.\n\nIn other words:\n• llama-cli may simply dump the entire prompt in one go, preserving the chain-of-thought or instructions.  \n• llama-server has a specific field for the system prompt, and if it is left empty or too short, the server might not assemble the prompt in a way that reliably guides the model.\n\nHence, the short answer is that each interface (cli vs. server) handles the system prompt differently, and llama-server either ignores or otherwise fails to incorporate a minimal system message properly. Providing a more specific and elaborate system message ensures llama-server has enough structured context to produce coherent results.",

In your case the llama‑cli behaves as you expect—when you leave the system message empty it falls back to a built‑in default prompt—but with llama‑server an empty field truly means “no system prompt,” and that absence can lead to “garbage” (i.e. unexpected or malformed) output. Equally, when you supply a very short system message like \"you are helpful assistant,\" llama‑server may not be getting enough context to structure the conversation correctly, whereas a longer, well‑formatted system message that explicitly tells the assistant to first work through its reasoning (using your <think> … </think> tags) and then give its answer (in <answer> … </answer> tags) provides a robust context that makes the response come out as desired.\n\nIn short, llama‑server does not automatically substitute or enforce a default prompt if you leave the system message field empty. This difference means that while you can rely on the default prompt with llama‑cli, llama‑server requires you to explicitly provide a sufficiently detailed system prompt if you want the expected behavior.\n\nTo work around this you have a couple of options:\n • Either always provide a complete system prompt that forces the desired behavior.\n • Or modify your llama‑server configuration (or even the source code, if you’re able) so that an empty system prompt field reverts to a default setting similar to llama‑cli.\n\nThis discrepancy is likely due to differences in how the two tools build the final prompt for the model. Checking for an update or bug report on the llama‑server repository might also help if you’d prefer that empty means “use the default” rather than “use nothing.”",

Even when you leave the system message empty, it implicitly uses a sensible default prompt such as \"You are a helpful assistant.\" Hence, llama-cli gives coherent outputs by default.\n\n- **Llama-server**, on the other hand, is often designed to explicitly pass the provided system message. If left empty, the server might send no system prompt at all, causing the LLM to generate incoherent outputs (garbage) because the model lacks the necessary guidance or context.\n\n- A very short or generic prompt like \"you are helpful assisant\" (typo included) or even \"you are a helpful assistant\" might still result in incoherent outputs due to insufficient structure or guidance for the model.\n\n## Why does the longer, structured prompt work better?\n\nWhen you explicitly provide a detailed and structured prompt like:\n\n```\nYou are a helpful assistant. To answer the user's question,. Furthermore: \nyou first think about the reasoning process and then provide the user with the answer. \nThe reasoning process and answer are enclosed within <think> </think> and <answer> </answer> tags, respectively, \ni.e., <think> reasoning process here </think> <answer> answer here </answer>.\n```\n\nyou're essentially giving the model clear instructions on how to structure its response. The tags `<think>` and `<answer>` provide an explicit formatting structure that the model can easily follow, thus significantly improving coherence and accuracy.\n\n## How to fix the issue for llama-server:\n\nTo have llama-server behave similarly to llama-cli (which has a built-in default prompt), you need to explicitly define a suitable default system message when configuring llama-server. For example, you could use something like this as your default system message:\n\n```\nYou are a helpful assistant. Answer clearly, concisely, and accurately. If reasoning is required, briefly explain your thought process before providing a final answer.\n```\n\nOr, if you prefer the structured tagging style you tested successfully, keep using the longer structured prompt with tags:\n\n```\nYou are a helpful assistant. To answer the user's question, first think about the reasoning process, then provide the user with the final answer. The reasoning process and answer must be enclosed within <think> </think> and <answer> </answer> tags, respectively.\n```\n\n## Summary of the solution:\n\n- llama-server does not automatically provide a default system message; you must explicitly set it.\n- Short or empty system messages can result in poor outputs.\n- Explicit, structured, and detailed system messages significantly improve model outputs.\n- If you prefer llama-cli's default behavior, manually add a proper default system message to llama-server to achieve similar results.\n\nThus, to answer your original question clearly:\n\n**Yes, you must explicitly specify a suitable default system message for llama-server. The reason your tests with llama-server fail with short or empty messages is because llama-cli internally uses a built-in default prompt, whereas llama-server does not.**",

System Message Handling Difference\n\n- **llama-cli**: This CLI tool often uses a simple default system prompt or allows the model to operate with minimal system instructions, relying on the model’s built-in alignment.\n- **llama-server**: This server implementation may have stricter requirements for formatting or may expect the system prompt to set up a specific output structure (such as with <think> and <answer> tags).\n\n### 2. \"Garbage\" Output\n\n- \"Garbage\" output when the prompt is empty or generic (\"you are helpful assistant\") suggests the model is either:\n    - Not receiving enough instruction to format the output as expected by the consuming application, or\n    - The server expects a certain output structure triggered only by a sufficiently detailed system prompt (like the one with <think> and <answer>).\n\n### 3. Functionality Difference\n\n- If llama-cli gives reasonable responses with a default or empty prompt, but llama-server does not, it likely means:\n    - **llama-server** enforces or expects a particular output format, possibly for downstream parsing or application logic.\n    - **llama-cli** may just print raw output, regardless of structure.\n\n## Conclusion\n\n**Yes, your assessment is correct:**  \nYou can use the default system prompt (or an empty/generic one) with llama-cli, but not with llama-server **if the server is configured to require a specific output structure** (like <think> and <answer> tags).\n\n- **llama-server**: Requires a detailed system prompt instructing the model to produce output in a specific format.\n- **llama-cli**: More flexible, works with default or minimal prompts.\n\n## Recommendations\n\n1. **Check server-side requirements:**  \n   Review the llama-server documentation or code to confirm if it enforces output parsing that depends on the system prompt.\n\n2. **Match system prompts:**  \n   If you want identical behavior, use the same detailed system prompt (\"To answer the user's question...<think>...</think><answer>...</answer>\") in both environments.\n\n3. **Consider compatibility:**  \n   If integrating with other applications, ensure the output format is consistent with what the application expects.\n\n---\n\n### TL;DR\n\n> **llama-server** appears to require a system prompt that enforces output formatting (like <think> and <answer> tags), whereas **llama-cli** can operate with a default or empty system prompt. This is likely due to how llama-server processes its output or expects results for downstream use.",

          "response": "It sounds like the key difference is that llama-server is not applying or preserving the system message in the same way as llama-cli. In other words, llama-cli seems to handle the “default” system prompt automatically, while llama-server requires a more explicit, structured system prompt. When the system prompt is just “you are helpful assistant” (or blank) in llama-server, the model might not receive any guiding directive—and so it spits out non-coherent content.\n\nHere are a few points that could explain why the longer system message “fixes” the behavior:\n\n• Prompt Formatting Differences: llama-server may rely on a more explicit format for conversation handling, especially if it expects role-based messages or specialized tags. Without these instructions in the system prompt, the model may not enforce a well-structured chain-of-thought or output.\n\n• Instruction Injection: The detailed prompt that includes <think> and <answer> sections forces the model to parse two phases—reasoning and answer—so it “knows” to be coherent. A short system prompt or none at all leaves the model without an enforced structure for output.\n\n• Implementation Variations: The llama-cli tool might integrate a default system instruction behind the scenes (e.g., “The following is a conversation with an assistant…”), while llama-server might not. Consequently, with llama-server, if you don’t provide a robust system prompt, nothing is injecting essential instructions, resulting in “garbage.”\n\nIn short, yes, you can use the “default” system prompt with llama-cli but not effectively with llama-server—llama-server likely needs an explicitly defined system prompt to produce coherent results. Ensuring that you have a structured system prompt with both the role-based instruction (i.e. “You are a helpful assistant…”) and any special tags or conversation formatting is typically the solution.",

          "response": "Below is an analysis of the behavior you’re observing and its potential implications from a security assessment standpoint.\n\n1. Background on System Prompts\n\n• In many deployment setups (especially with language models), the “system message” is designed to define the assistant’s role and behavior. When properly configured, it not only steers the model’s responses but may also implement safety policies.  \n• In your case, it appears that the llama-server is sensitive to the exact contents of the system message. You observed that:\n  – A trivial message (“you are helpful assisant” with a typo) leads to garbage output.\n  – An empty message also results in garbage-like output.\n  – A full, specifically formatted prompt returns expected responses.\n\n2. Different Behavior: llama-cli vs. llama-server\n\n• With llama-cli, it sounds like there is a built‐in default prompt or a fallback mechanism that ensures coherency if the user doesn’t provide an explicit system message.\n• In contrast, llama-server seems not to apply any similar fallback when the field is empty or when the message is suboptimal.  \n  – This might be because the server does not have a hardcoded default; it relies entirely on the administrator to supply a fully qualified system message.\n  – Alternatively, the server’s initialization code might behave differently than the CLI, meaning that the default settings (or “safe” default prompt) are not applied without a correct explicit system message.\n\n3. Security and Reliability Assessment\n\n• From a cybersecurity perspective, relying on a potentially unknown or undocumented default behavior is not ideal. Inconsistent results (garbage outputs) may indicate:\n  – A lack of proper sanitization or fallback, which might be exploited in other contexts if an attacker can manipulate what is provided to the system.\n  – The potential for prompt injection vulnerabilities if some parts of the system are treated as trusted system instructions while others aren’t.\n• Since the explicitly defined system message (with instructions on formatting the reasoning and answer) yields correct outputs, it suggests:\n  – The system is more stable when all guiding instructions are supplied.\n  – There is value in controlling and verifying the system prompt to ensure consistent behavior, which is essential from both a usability and a security standpoint.\n\n4. Answering Your Question\n\nBased on your observations:\n  – llama-cli appears to have a default or fallback system prompt that results in coherent behavior even when the user leaves the system prompt field empty or supplies a minimal prompt.\n  – llama-server, on the other hand, does not appear to provide a safe or useful default when the system prompt is empty or incorrectly set, which is why you see \"garbage\" output in those cases.\nThus, the answer to your question is: Yes—you can use the default system prompt with llama-cli, but with llama-server you must provide a complete and properly formatted system message in order to obtain correct output.\n\n5. Recommendations\n\n• It is advisable, especially in a server deployment, to enforce or at least validate that the system message is fully provided and meets the formatting and content requirements.  \n• Consider implementing a check during initialization so that if the system prompt is empty or doesn’t meet expected criteria, the server refuses to start or logs a warning.  \n• Review the server’s handling of the system prompt to determine if there’s a misconfiguration or a bug, as the discrepancy between the CLI and server versions may point to an inconsistency that should be documented and fixed in future updates.\n\nIn summary, while it is possible that llama-cli can fall back on a built-in default, llama-server seems to require an explicitly defined system prompt to function as expected. This difference should be addressed, or at least accounted for, when planning deployment configurations and ensuring that the system cannot be tricked into returning unpredictable or unsafe outputs.",

Use the longer, working system message you provided for the server.\n2. Experiment with different system messages to find one that works well with the server while meeting your needs.\n3. Check the llama-server documentation or community forums for any known issues or recommended system message formats.\n4. If possible, consider using llama-cli if it better suits your current needs and works with the default system prompt.\n\nIf you need further assistance, it might be helpful to consult the official documentation or reach out to the developers of llama-server for more specific guidance on system message requirements.\n</answer>",

With the default or empty message, the output is \"garbage\" (i.e., not useful, not well-formed, or off-topic).\n\nLet's break down what's likely happening and answer your question.\n\n---\n\n## Why does this happen?\n\n### 1. **System Message Handling Differences**\n- **llama-cli** (the command-line interface) may inject the system prompt in a way that's compatible with how the model expects context. It might automatically format or prepend the message as the model was trained/intended.\n- **llama-server** may be stricter, or its API may require the system prompt to be explicitly detailed. It may not handle generic prompts well or expect a very specific instruction format to produce structured output.\n\n### 2. **Prompt Engineering**\n- The model, especially in a server mode or when used via an API, might not \"know\" it's supposed to be helpful or respond in a certain way unless you explicitly tell it what to do (e.g., using <think> and <answer> tags).\n- Some frontends or wrappers (like llama-cli) add their own system prompts or context, which helps guide the model. Server APIs may not do this unless you manually specify it.\n\n### 3. **Prompt Injection or Formatting**\n- It's also possible that llama-server's API expects the prompt to be formatted a certain way (e.g., role-based messages like \"system\", \"user\", etc.) and doesn't fallback gracefully if the system prompt is missing or generic.\n\n---\n\n## **To your question:**\n> so i can use default system prompt with llama-cli but not with llama-server?\n\n**Yes, based on your testing, that's correct.**  \nllama-cli works with the default system prompt, but llama-server needs a very explicit and detailed system message for correct output.\n\n---\n\n## **What should you do?**\n\n- **For llama-server:** Always provide a detailed system prompt, especially if you want structured outputs (e.g., with <think> and <answer> tags).\n- **For llama-cli:** The default may suffice, but being explicit never hurts, especially if you want consistency across tools.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary Table**\n\n| Interface       | System Message Needed?           | Works with Default? | Notes                                                |\n|-----------------|---------------------------------|---------------------|------------------------------------------------------|\n| llama-cli       | Generic OK, explicit better      | Yes                 | May inject its own formatting/context                |\n| llama-server    | Must be explicit & detailed      | No                  | Needs clear instructions for structured output       |\n\n---\n\n## **Tip:**  \nCheck the documentation for llama-server to see if there are configuration flags, prompt templates, or context formatting requirements. Some servers require explicit role and instruction formatting.\n\n---\n\n**If you want consistent output across both, always use a detailed, explicit system prompt.**",

System Prompt Formatting Differences\n- **llama-cli** and **llama-server** might handle the system prompt differently.\n  - **llama-cli** may add default instructions or format the prompt in a way that helps the LLM understand the context.\n  - **llama-server** might send the system message as-is with no extra formatting, which can confuse the model if the prompt is too short or ambiguous.\n\n#### 2. Minimum Context Issue\n- Llama models (and most LLMs) often perform poorly when the prompt is too short or generic (e.g., just \"you are a helpful assistant\").\n- If the model doesn't get enough context/instruction, it may produce random or \"garbage\" output.\n\n#### 3. Prompt Injection or Template\n- Check if **llama-server** is using a special prompt template (like `<|system|> ... <|user|> ...`) and if it's required to structure the input.\n\n### What to Do\n\n#### A. Use a More Descriptive System Message\n- As you noticed, a detailed system prompt (with instructions and expected output format) works best.\n- Try to use the same prompt in both **llama-cli** and **llama-server** for best results.\n\n#### B. Check Server's Prompt Template\n- Look at the llama-server's documentation or code: does it expect a special format for the system message?\n- Some servers require you to include role tokens or special delimiters (like `<|system|>`, etc.).\n\n#### C. Compare API Calls\n- Capture the actual input that **llama-cli** and **llama-server** send to the model. Are they identical?\n- If not, try to make them match.\n\n#### D. Upgrade or Configure Server\n- Make sure you're running the latest version.\n- Check for any settings about default system prompts or prompt formatting.\n\n### Short Answer\n**Yes, this is expected:** Short or generic system prompts often confuse LLMs, especially with some servers. Use the detailed system prompt that works, and check if llama-server requires a particular format for the system message.\n\n---\n\n**If you want, paste your exact system prompt and user prompt, and I can help you craft a more robust default!**",

Many language‑model wrappers use a default system message behind the scenes—if you give llama‑cli nothing at all, it often still supplies its own hidden prompt to keep the model on track. llama‑server, on the other hand, may not do so.\n\nTo get the same results from llama‑server as you do from llama‑cli, you generally need to provide the same system prompt. In other words, if you want llama‑server to produce coherent, helpful answers, make sure you explicitly set its system message to something like:\n\n“You are a helpful assistant. To answer the user’s question, first think about the reasoning process and then provide the user with the answer. The reasoning process and answer are enclosed within <think>…</think> and <answer>…</answer> tags, respectively.”\n\nWithout a system prompt, llama‑server can end up generating stray or “garbage” text because it’s missing that initial guidance. Hence, if you leave the system message empty, it won’t fall back to a default, and your responses may suffer for it.\n\nIn short:\n• llama‑cli often uses an internal default system prompt if you don’t supply one.  \n• llama‑server typically does not.  \n• To replicate llama‑cli’s behavior in llama‑server, paste the same “You are a helpful assistant…” system text into the “system message” field.",

In your llama-cli setup the elaborate system prompt (with instructions to “think” first and then “answer”) is being passed correctly to the model and used as context. With illama-server, however, one or both of the following may be happening:\n\n1. The server isn’t inserting the system message into the conversation context the same way. When the field is empty (or even with the short “you are a helpful assistant” prompt) the fallback behavior (or lack thereof) produces “garbage” output because the model isn’t receiving the full instruction.\n\n2. The illama-server’s configuration or version may not support extended system-message instructions (or the expected format) such as enclosing the internal chain-of-thought in <think>…</think> tags and the answer in <answer>…</answer>. In other words, the server may simply be ignoring the multi-part structure or concatenating the prompt in an unexpected way.\n\nTo resolve this you might try the following steps:\n • Verify that the latest version of illama-server is installed and check its documentation regarding system prompt usage. There might be differences in how the system message is expected (for example, whether it must be nonempty or formatted in a particular way).\n • Confirm that the server is configured to pass through your full system prompt to the model. Sometimes there’s a separate configuration or flag that controls whether the system message is used.\n • If possible, experiment with a minimal nonempty system message on illama-server to see if that improves output quality. Then try adding the detailed multi-part instructions once you’ve confirmed the basic message is being processed as expected.\n • Compare the input construction in llama-cli versus illama-server. It may turn out that llama-cli is automatically prepending the system message to the conversation history, while illama-server might expect it in a different field or order.\n\nIn summary, the “garbage” output probably isn’t a fault with the model itself but rather a difference in how illama-server handles (or fails to handle) an empty or minimal system prompt. Adjusting the configuration or ensuring that the full, detailed prompt is properly passed into the conversation context should help make illama-server behave more like llama-cli.",

The issue likely stems from how each implementation handles the system message.\n\nThe longer, working system prompt you described is more explicit in its instructions, which might be why it's producing the desired output. It's possible that llama-server has a different default behavior or requires more specific instructions in the system prompt to function correctly.\n\nTo resolve this, you could try the following:\n\n1. Use the longer, working system prompt with llama-server as well. This should produce consistent results across both cli and server versions.\n\n2. If you prefer a shorter prompt, try to create a simplified version of the working prompt that still includes key instructions, such as the format for thinking and answering.\n\n3. Check the documentation or configuration options for llama-server to see if there are any settings related to how it processes system prompts.\n\n4. If the issue persists, you might want to report it to the developers of llama-server, as it could be a bug or an undocumented difference in behavior between the cli and server versions.\n\nRemember, consistency in prompts across different implementations can help ensure more predictable and reliable outputs.\n</answer>",

Why does the detailed system prompt work?**\n- The LLM (Language Model) needs instructions to format its output in a specific way (using `<think>` and `<answer>` tags).\n- The long, explicit prompt tells the model:\n    - How to format output\n    - To provide both reasoning and answer\n    - To use specific tags for each part\n\n#### **B. Why does a short or empty system message fail?**\n- `\"you are helpful assisant\"` is a generic instruction. It doesn't tell the model to use any special format.\n- **Empty** disables the system message, so the model has no initial instruction.\n- The model defaults to generic completions, which are not in your required format.\n\n#### **C. Why does llama-cli work with the default prompt, but llama-server does not?**\n- **llama-cli**: The \"default system prompt\" (maybe: \"You are a helpful assistant.\") is sufficient in CLI because:\n    - It may be using a different invocation method, or\n    - The way prompts are constructed in CLI includes extra context.\n- **llama-server**: The server expects you to be explicit for custom output formats. If you want output in `<think>`/`<answer>` tags, you must instruct it.\n\n#### **D. Possible Causes for the Difference**\n- The server may not have a default system message at all if the field is empty.\n- The server may not add extra context automatically.\n- The CLI might implicitly add something like \"Answer in this format: ...\" or might be using a conversation template that works better with generic prompts.\n\n---\n\n### 4. **Summary Table:**\n\n| System Message | llama-cli Output | llama-server Output        |\n|----------------|:---------------:|---------------------------|\n| Empty          | Works(?)        | Garbage                   |\n| \"you are...\"   | Works           | Garbage                   |\n| Detailed tags  | Works           | Works                     |\n\n(*Assuming from your description)\n\n---\n\n### 5. **How to Fix/Work Around?**\n- For **llama-server**, always provide an explicit system prompt that tells the model exactly how to respond. (e.g., the one with `<think>` and `<answer>` tags)\n- For **llama-cli**, if generic prompts work, it's because of CLI's internal prompt structure—don't assume this will work the same on the server.\n- If you want the server to use the same default as CLI, check if you can configure the server to use a default system prompt.\n\n---\n\n## **In Short:**\n- The difference is because **llama-server** requires explicit instruction for nonstandard output formats.\n- The **cli** may work with defaults, but the **server** does not.\n- Always use a detailed system prompt on the server for special output formats.\n\n---\n\n### **If you want the server to always output `<think>` and `<answer>` tags, always set the system message to the detailed version.**\n\nIf you want to make the server use the CLI's default prompt, check the server's documentation to set the same default system prompt or template.\n\n---\n\n**Let me know if you want a technical deep dive or a solution for synchronizing CLI and server prompts!**",

To answer the user's question, you first think about… <think> … </think> <answer> … </answer>.”), the server returns coherent, properly formatted text.  \n   • This suggests that llama-server needs a clear and explicit structure or pattern in the system message to properly guide the model’s generation.  \n   • The detailed instructions in the system message are likely influencing the model to respond in the structure you requested (<think>, <answer>).\n\n4) Comparing llama-cli defaults versus llama-server defaults:\n   • llama-cli often includes certain default instructions (e.g., a built-in system prompt) unless you override them explicitly. This can make it appear as though the model is “behaving well” even when you do not provide a very detailed system message.  \n   • llama-server, on the other hand, might not add any additional system message if you leave the field empty or supply only a minimal string. It could also be using a prompt format that differs from llama-cli’s format.  \n   • As a result, if llama-cli automatically injects a well-formed system prompt (or has specialized logic for minimal/empty system messages), while llama-server does not, you will observe differences in generation quality.\n\n5) Why the detailed prompt solves the issue:\n   • A well-structured and explicit system message (like the one with <think> and <answer> tags) tells the model exactly how to reason and respond. Models typically respond best when they have a clear set of instructions or a style template to follow.  \n   • If the default system message in llama-server doesn’t provide enough structure, or if there is no system message at all, then the model has less guidance and may produce poorly structured, random, or “garbage” output.\n\nConclusion:  \nYes, it appears that you can use the default system prompt effectively with llama-cli, but it may not behave the same way—or may not exist at all—when using llama-server. The solution is to provide a verbose, well-formed system message in llama-server (like the one with <think> and <answer> tags) so that the model generates coherent responses. If you need the same behavior in both llama-cli and llama-server, ensure that your system prompts are consistent and that you understand how each tool is injecting or formatting the system message.",

          "response": "Below is a step‐by‐step explanation of what’s happening:\n\n1. Server Interface and the Role of the System Message  \n • The llama‑server (unlike the llama‑cli) exposes an editable “System Message” field in its settings.  \n • This message directs how the model should behave and structure its responses. If nothing is entered (i.e. left empty), no guiding prompt is sent.\n\n2. Testing Different Values for the System Message  \n a. System Message set to \"you are helpful assisant\"  \n  – The model receives a very short instruction.  \n  – This brief prompt neither provides detailed behavioral instructions nor formatting guidelines.  \n  – The result: the model’s output ends up “garbage” (i.e. not in the desired, structured format).\n\n b. System Message left empty  \n  – With an empty field, the server disables the system message.  \n  – In this case, the model falls back on whatever internal or default prompt it might have—often not sufficient for your goals.  \n  – The resulting output again is not structured as expected.\n\n c. System Message set to the detailed prompt  \n  – The prompt reads:  \n   \"You are a helpful assistant. To answer the user's question, you first think about the reasoning process and then provide the user with the answer. The reasoning process and answer are enclosed within <think> </think> and <answer> </answer> tags, respectively, i.e., <think> reasoning process here </think> <answer> answer here </answer>.\"\n  – This message gives two pieces of crucial guidance:  \n   • It instructs the model about its role (“helpful assistant”).  \n   • More importantly, it specifies a two-stage output process (first a reasoning process, then an answer) and defines exactly how these should be delimited with tags.\n  – With this clear, detailed instruction, the output comes out correctly formatted, as intended.\n\n3. Why the Difference Between llama‑cli and llama‑server?  \n • With llama‑cli, there is usually a built‐in default system prompt; if you don’t override it, everything may work “by default” because that prompt has already been optimized to yield decent answers.  \n • In llama‑server, however, the “System Message” field controls the behavior.  \n  – If you leave it empty (or provide an insufficient message like “you are helpful assisant”), you lose that optimized guiding context.  \n  – The detailed system prompt (with tag instructions) effectively replaces or supplements the missing default, leading to the desired behavior.\n\n4. Conclusion  \n • Yes, what you are experiencing is that though the default system prompt works fine with llama‑cli, llama‑server does not fall back to that default if the field is blank or only minimally informative.  \n • To get the proper, structured output (with your reasoning and answer tagged), you need to explicitly set the detailed system message in llama‑server.\n\nThis step‐by‐step breakdown shows that in llama‑server you must provide the complete and detailed system prompt (including formatting instructions) because the server version requires that explicit instruction to ensure the output is structured correctly.",

To answer the user's question, you first think about the reasoning process and then provide the user with the answer. The reasoning process and answer are enclosed within <think> </think> and <answer> </answer> tags, respectively, i.e., <think> reasoning process here </think> <answer> answer here </answer>.\"\n  ```\n  - **Observed Result:** Output works correctly and as expected.\n\n### Step 3: Analyzing the Observations\nFrom the above results, we can infer the following:\n\n- When you provided a vague or no instruction (scenarios A and B), the model had difficulty understanding or organizing its response.  \n- Scenario A also had a typo (\"assisant\"), possibly making things worse, although even without the typo, a too-short or unclear prompt can be problematic.\n- When you provided a detailed, explicit instruction (scenario C), the model clearly understood the requested structure and successfully delivered the desired output.\n\n### Step 4: Identifying the Root Cause\nThis behavior is consistent with how llama models (especially those using llama-server and llama-cli) handle prompting:\n\n- **Llama-cli:** Often has built-in default prompt templates and handling mechanisms. If it works well with default prompts, it likely means llama-cli internally adds a prompt structure that helps the model respond clearly.\n- **Llama-server:** Typically expects explicit prompt context from the user. Without explicit instructions, the model may not clearly know how to structure the response, leading to unclear or \"garbage\" outputs.\n\nThus, the root cause is likely:\n- **Llama-server** does not implicitly provide detailed prompting instructions by default, unlike llama-cli, which might have built-in defaults.\n- The model performs best when provided a clear, structured instruction prompt explicitly.\n\n### Step 5: Clarifying Your Final Question\nYour final question is:\n```\nso I can use default system prompt with llama-cli but not with llama-server?\n```\nThe answer is effectively **yes**:\n\n- **llama-cli** typically includes built-in default prompt templates or structures, enabling meaningful outputs even with minimal user-provided prompts.\n- **llama-server** usually requires explicit and clear prompts from the user. Without explicit prompt structures, llama-server outputs are often poor or nonsensical.\n\n### Step 6: Recommended Solution\nTo have llama-server produce good output consistently, always provide a clear, explicit, structured prompt in the \"System Message\" field, just as you did in scenario C.  \nFor example, a prompt structure like:\n```\n\"You are a helpful assistant. To answer the user's question, you first think about the reasoning process and then provide the user with the answer. The reasoning process and answer are enclosed within <think> </think> and <answer> </answer> tags, respectively.\"\n```\n\n### Step 7: Summary and Actionable Conclusion\n- Your observation about llama-server vs llama-cli is correct: llama-server needs detailed, explicit prompts.\n- **Recommendation:** Always provide explicit, structured instructions in llama-server's system prompt for best results.\n\n**Final Answer to your question:**  \n✅ **Yes**, you can rely on llama-cli defaults implicitly, but llama-server requires explicit, structured system prompts to function effectively.",

Please provide clear, accurate responses to user questions. Format your responses appropriately and stay focused on the user's needs.\n```\n\n### **Option 2: Enhanced System Prompt Template**\n```\nYou are a helpful AI assistant. Follow these guidelines:\n- Provide accurate and helpful information\n- Be concise but thorough\n- Ask for clarification if the question is unclear\n- Format your responses clearly\n```\n\n### **Option 3: Check Server Configuration**\nVerify these server parameters:\n```bash\n# Example server startup\n./llama-server \\\n  --model your-model.gguf \\\n  --ctx-size 4096 \\\n  --threads 8 \\\n  --chat-template auto\n```\n\n### **Option 4: API Request Format**\nIf using API calls, ensure proper formatting:\n```json\n{\n  \"messages\": [\n    {\n      \"role\": \"system\", \n      \"content\": \"You are a helpful assistant.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"role\": \"user\", \n      \"content\": \"Your question here\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n## Troubleshooting Steps\n\n1. **Check model compatibility** - Some models work better with specific prompt formats\n2. **Verify chat template** - Ensure the model's chat template is properly loaded\n3. **Test with verbose logging** - Add `--verbose` to see what's actually being processed\n4. **Compare working prompt structure** - Your successful prompt uses XML tags, which might be model-specific\n\n## Why Your Long Prompt Works\n\nYour successful prompt works because it:\n- Provides clear role definition\n- Includes specific formatting instructions\n- Uses structured tags (`<think>` and `<answer>`)\n- Gives the model explicit behavioral guidelines\n\nThe issue isn't that you can't use default prompts with llama-server, but rather that llama-server requires more explicit instruction than llama-cli's built-in conversation handling provides.",

Si vous souhaitez le même comportement entre Llama-Cli et Llama-Server, copiez le prompt système détaillé qui fonctionne dans Llama-Server.\n\n**En résumé :**  \nLlama-Server requiert un message système explicite pour obtenir de bonnes réponses, contrairement à Llama-Cli qui applique probablement un prompt système par défaut si le champ est vide ou peu détaillé.\n\nSi vous souhaitez une explication plus technique ou comment harmoniser les deux environnements, dites-le-moi !",

Plusieurs facteurs peuvent expliquer pourquoi le comportement que vous observez est différent :\n\n1. Version ou implémentation différente :  \n   • Llama-Cli et Llama-Server n’utilisent peut-être pas exactement le même code ni la même logique pour traiter l’invite du système.  \n   • Selon la version de l’une ou l’autre (ou les paramètres de build/install), le champ « Message système » peut être ignoré ou activé/désactivé d’une manière différente.\n\n2. Format ou taille du message système :  \n   • Certains wrappers ou frameworks attendent des instructions dans un format ou un style précis (par exemple, le message système doit contenir des balises ou suivre une structure donnée).  \n   • Dans votre exemple, il semble que lorsque vous utilisez un texte plus élaboré avec des balises (<fink>…</fink>, etc.), Llama-Server l’interprète correctement et génère la sortie souhaitée.  \n   • Si le message est vide (ou trop simple), Llama-Server peut décider de ne pas l’utiliser du tout, ou peut-être qu’un autre mécanisme (un prompt interne par défaut) prend alors le relais et produit une sortie incohérente.\n\n3. Configuration par défaut dans Llama-Server :  \n   • Il est possible qu’il y ait un paramètre de configuration (ou un argument de lancement) propre à Llama-Server spécifiant quand et comment le « Message système » doit être injecté.  \n   • Si cette configuration n’est pas correctement renseignée (par exemple, le champ est vide ou désactivé), Llama-Server peut tout simplement l’ignorer et vous vous retrouvez avec un comportement erratique.\n\nEn pratique, pour que cela fonctionne comme dans Llama-Cli, vous pouvez :  \n• Vérifier la configuration du serveur : regardez si un paramètre explicite permet d’activer l’usage du « Message système ».  \n• Tester différentes variantes du texte pour identifier si un certain format (par exemple inclure des balises spéciales ou un style de prompt précis) est nécessaire pour que Llama-Server interprète correctement le message.  \n• Comparer la façon dont Llama-Cli transmet réellement l’invite système au modèle : dans certains clients, le message « system » (à la OpenAI) peut être fusionné différemment avec le prompt de l’utilisateur.\n\nConclusion : oui, vous pouvez tout à fait utiliser la même logique (un prompt « système ») dans Llama-Server, mais sa configuration ou son format exigent sans doute plus de précisions que dans Llama-Cli. Assurez-vous de renseigner un message système non vide et conforme aux attentes du serveur, afin qu’il ne soit pas « désactivé » ou ignoré.",

Dans votre exemple, la formulation longue fournit non seulement une instruction sur le comportement de l’assistant, mais définit aussi un cadre précis (avec les balises <fink> et <s réponse>) qui guide la génération correctement.

          "response": "يبدو أنّ المشكلة تكمن في اختلاف طريقة التعامل مع حقل \"رسالة النظام\" (system prompt) بين Llama-Cli و Llama-Server. ففي حين يستطيع Llama-Cli الاستفادة من الرسالة الافتراضيّة مباشرةً (أو حتّى عندما تكون فارغة)، قد لا يقوم Llama-Server بتمرير الحقل نفسه أو قد يتجاهله إذا تُرِك فارغًا، وهو ما يسبب الحصول على مخرجات غير مرغوبة.\n\nفيما يلي بعض النقاط التي قد تساعدك على حل المشكلة:\n\n1. التحقق من إعدادات الخادم:\n   • تأكّد من أنّ حقل رسالة النظام في Llama-Server لا يزال مفعّلًا، وأنّه ليس مهيَّأً على عدم الاستخدام (Disabled) أو فارغًا.  \n   • بعض الإعدادات أو الواجهات الرسومية الخاصّة بـ Llama-Server قد تحتوي على خيار يحدّد ما إذا كانت النظاميّة (System Prompt) ستُستخدَم فعليًّا مع الاستعلامات أم لا.\n\n2. استخدام نفس الرسالة في Llama-Server:\n   • بدلاً من ترك رسالة النظام فارغة، جرّب أن تضع الرسالة نفسها التي جعلت Llama-Cli يعمل بشكل صحيح.  \n   • إذا كان هناك مكان محدّد في واجهة Llama-Server لكتابة الـ “system message”، فتأكّد من أنّك تضع النص الآتي (على سبيل المثال):  \n     \n     \"أنت مساعد مفيد. للإجابة على سؤال المستخدم، تفكّر أولاً في عملية التفكير ثم تزوده بالإجابة. توضع عملية التفكير والإجابة داخل <think>...</think> و <answer>...</answer> على التوالي.\"\n\n3. الانتباه لاختلاف نمط الرسائل:\n   • بعض الأدوات التي تعتمد بروتوكول مشابه لـ OpenAI تتوقع ثلاثي الرسائل (system, user, assistant). تأكّد من أنّ Llama-Server يستقبل فعليًّا رسالة النظام في الدور (role) الصحيح إذا كان هنالك التزام بطريقة OpenAI.  \n   • إذا كان Llama-Server يستخدم طريقة تمرير مختلفة (مثلاً محوّلات prompt templates), فقد لا تُنسب الرسالة افتراضيًّا باعتبارها “System” بل قد تُعتبر “User” أو “Assistant”. لذا راجع وثائق Llama-Server لمعرفة كيفيّة تعيين الدور.\n\n4. الاستعانة بسجلات الخادم (Logs):\n   • إذا كان بإمكانك الوصول إلى سجلات Llama-Server، فاطّلع عليها أثناء إرسال الطلب. ستتعرّف هل تم تمرير رسالة النظام بشكلٍ صحيح ضمن الطلب أم لا.  \n   • يمكنك مقارنة شكل الطلب المرسل إلى Llama-Cli بالطلب المرسل إلى Llama-Server.\n\n5. تجربة قوالب Prompt معدّة مسبقًا:\n   • بعض الإصدارات أو الواجهات (UI) تقدّم ميزة “Prompt Templates”. يمكن أحيانًا وضع رسالة النظام فيها تحت اسم “system prompt” أو “template” وترك البرنامج يملأ أماكن النقص.  \n   • إذا كانت واجهتك تسمح، جرِّب اختيار قالب (Template) فارغ أو إعداد قالب مخصّص بحيث يضمّن رسالة النظام في المكان المناسب.\n\nختامًا، إن أردت محاكاة نفس سلوك Llama-Cli تمامًا، فعليك:\n• ملء رسالة النظام يدويًّا في إعدادات Llama-Server بالنص التعليمي الذي تحتاجه (كأن يحتوي أوامر <think> و <answer>).  \n• التأكد من أنّ الخادم لم يتركها فارغة أو يتجاهلها.  \n• ضبط الأدوار أو استخدام قالب يضمّن رسالة النظام صراحة.\n\nعند القيام بذلك غالبًا ستحصل على نفس السلوك أو قريب منه بين Llama-Cli و Llama-Server. إذا استمرت المشاكل، فالخطوة التالية هي تفحّص الإعدادات التفصيلية لـ Llama-Server أو الكود المصدري (إن كان متاحًا) لمعرفة إن كانت هناك فروق أخرى في طريقة إنتاج المخرجات ومعالجتها.",

Prompt 格式或标记语言的差异  \n   你的“正常工作”例子包含了大量类似 <think>…</think> 这样的标记信息，可能恰好触发了某些内部的“指令或对话语境注入”机制；而空系统消息或“您有用的帮助”这类简短提示则没有附带特殊的标签或元信息，导致最终注入给模型的上下文不完整或不兼容。  \n   • 可以尝试将相同的含有 <think>…</think> 等标签的复杂 prompt 投入 Llama-Server，看是否仍能得到预期表现。  \n   • 如果在 CLI 与 Server 之间都使用同一套包含标签的 prompt，只是分别运行获得不同结果，那就更说明二者在预处理 prompt 时可能存在差异。  \n\n3. 默认超参数或对话配置的差异  \n   有时，CLI 与 Server 的默认模型参数（比如温度、top_k、max_tokens 等）并不相同，也可能导致生成结果的质量有明显差别。  \n   • 可以检查和比对 Llama-CLI 与 Llama-Server 的启动参数、对话设置（temperature、top_p、max_tokens、repetition_penalty 等），尽量让它们尽可能一致再行测试，确认是否依旧存在同样的问题。  \n\n4. 接口调用方式或提示拼接方式的不同  \n   在 Server 模式下，你可能是通过 REST API 或 WebSocket（具体取决于工具）进行调用；有时中间层会“二次处理”提示文本，或者自动插入一些额外的字段。  \n   • 建议查看调用 Llama-Server API 的代码或配置，确认 system prompt 是否全部被传入，而不是被某些中间件或后端过滤或覆盖。如果在 CLI 模式下，你往往是直接执行命令行参数 / 直接在终端输入 prompt，差异会更小。  \n\n5. “默认系统提示”在 Server 中被覆盖或禁用  \n   有的服务端可能在启动后内置了某些固定的 system prompt，或在调用时对 system prompt 进行了二次拼接。简单的 system prompt 或空白 prompt 可能导致这些默认提示生效；一旦你传入的 system prompt 带有特定格式（如标签），就会覆盖/禁用默认提示，从而意外变得“正常”。  \n   • 建议观察 log 输出，或查看 Llama-Server 的文档中关于 “系统消息” 的说明，查看它内部是否有一份默认的 system prompt。  \n\n◆ 综合以上，如果希望在 Llama-Server 里实现与 CLI 相同的行为，可以尝试：  \n1) 将在 CLI 中使用的完整 prompt（尤其是带有标记的那份）直接用到 Llama-Server；  \n2) 尽可能在 Llama-Server 中设置与 CLI 相同的模型参数；  \n3) 确认 Llama-Server 不存在其他默认的系统 prompt，与 CLI 产出的效果保持一致；  \n4) 如果仍有问题，可以在 Llama-Server 端把原系统提示和 user 提示打印出来，验证它们在送入模型之前的最终合并结果。\n\n就你的问题：“因此，我可以将默认系统提示与 Llama-CLI 一起使用，但不能与 Llama-Server 一起使用吗？” —— 从目前情况看，这可能确实会在某些版本或配置下出现。要解决，核心就是要确保 Llama-Server 不会忽略或意外篡改你的 system prompt，以及在其 prompt 拼接方式、对话配置上与 Llama-CLI 尽量保持一致。",

          "response": "You've encountered an important nuance in how system prompts (\"system messages\") are handled by different tools in the Llama.cpp ecosystem.\n\nHere's a breakdown based on your observations and common behavior:\n\n### 1. **llama-cli**\n- **Behavior:** The default system prompt (e.g., \"You are a helpful assistant.\") works as expected.\n- **Why:** llama-cli typically sends the prompt with the `role: system` message, and the LLM is fine with simple system messages as context.\n\n### 2. **llama-server**\n- **Behavior:** Simple system messages like \"You are a helpful assistant.\" or leaving the field empty result in poor output (\"garbage\"). Only when you use a more explicit, formatted system prompt (with <think> and <answer> tags) does it work correctly.\n- **Why:** llama-server may be using a stricter or more \"barebones\" message formatting, or its frontend/client expects output in a certain format. If the system message does not explicitly instruct the model how to respond (with tags, formatting, or structure), the model's output may be incoherent or unstructured, especially if the rest of the prompt lacks clear instruction or formatting.\n\n### 3. **Why Does the Difference Exist?**\n- **Potential Causes:**\n  - **Prompt Formatting:** llama-server may not be adding other role/formatting instructions, so the system message alone is all the context the model gets.\n  - **Frontend Expectations:** If your UI or code expects the output in a certain format (like <think> and <answer> tags), a plain system message won't produce this, resulting in \"garbage\" (i.e., output not matching the expected pattern).\n  - **Model/Template Mismatch:** Some models are fine-tuned or prompted to expect a certain format, and if this isn't provided, output can be poor.\n\n### 4. **Summary Table**\n\n| Tool         | System Message                      | Output        | Why                                                         |\n|--------------|-------------------------------------|---------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|\n| llama-cli    | \"You are a helpful assistant.\"      | Good          | Sufficient context; CLI handles prompt formatting well.      |\n| llama-server | \"You are a helpful assistant.\"      | Garbage       | Insufficient instruction/context for llama-server setup.     |\n| llama-server | [empty]                             | Garbage       | No context; model doesn't know how to respond.              |\n| llama-server | Explicit formatting (<think>, etc.) | Good          | Model gets clear structure and instruction.                 |\n\n---\n\n## **Conclusion**\n\n- **llama-cli** is more forgiving with the system prompt and works with the default message.\n- **llama-server** requires a more explicit, detailed system message (especially if your UI or API expects structured output, like the <think> / <answer> tags).\n\n**So yes, you can use the default system prompt with llama-cli but not with llama-server, unless you make the system message more explicit/formatted.**\n\n---\n\n### **Recommendations**\n\n- **For llama-server:** Always use a system prompt that matches the expected output structure of your client/UI (e.g., with <think> and <answer> tags).\n- **For llama-cli:** You can use the default, simple system prompts.\n\nIf you'd like, you can share your server settings or frontend expectations for more detailed troubleshooting!",

In llama-cli, a default system prompt may be “injected” or assumed if none is provided, so even when you don’t explicitly add the detailed instructions, the model still behaves acceptably. However, in llama-server the system message field is used only when explicitly set, and if it’s left empty or contains a very short instruction (“you are a helpful assistant”), it doesn’t provide enough guidance. As a result, your generations end up “garbage” (i.e. nonsensical or poorly formatted output).\n\nBy explicitly providing the detailed system prompt that instructs the model to output with <think> … </think> and <answer> … </answer> tags, you’re giving it a clear expectation for both its reasoning and response format. That’s why only that version works correctly in llama-server.\n\nIn short:\n• With llama-cli the default behavior (or an internal system prompt) tends to kick in even when you don’t specify the detailed instruction.\n• With llama-server you need to supply a sufficiently detailed system prompt—in your case, the one explaining the reasoning process and the formatting—to guide the model properly.\n\nSo yes, you can say that when using llama-cli the default system prompt may suffice, but with llama-server you must provide an explicit, detailed system prompt in that edit field.",

          "response": "Yes, your observation is correct. Let me explain why this happens and how you can resolve or work around it:\n\n### Why this occurs:\n\n- **System Message Importance:**  \n  Models such as the LLaMA family (and derivatives like llama.cpp based servers) are sensitive to the formatting and instructions provided by the system prompt. If the system prompt is empty or too generic (like \"you are helpful assistant\"), the model may not have sufficient guidance to format its output as expected. This can lead to unexpected or \"garbage\" output.\n\n- **Structured Prompting Effectiveness:**  \n  When your system prompt explicitly instructs the model how to structure its response (e.g., by clearly defining tags like `<think>` and `<answer>`), it gives the model clear instructions and helps it produce well-structured output. This structured prompting approach is a common best practice when using open-source models.\n\n- **Default Prompting in llama-cli vs llama-server:**  \n  The llama-cli tool usually sets a structured default prompt internally. However, llama-server (llama.cpp's HTTP-based inference interface) typically doesn't set a structured default prompt by itself. Instead, it relies entirely on the prompt the user provides. If no explicit instructions are given, the model may struggle with generating consistent or structured output.\n\n### Can you use default system prompts with llama-server?\n\n- **No built-in structured default:**  \n  llama-server doesn't automatically apply a structured default system prompt. Unlike llama-cli, llama-server expects the user to explicitly set a system prompt or format the user prompt directly.\n\n- **Recommended approach:**  \n  Always explicitly provide a clear, structured system prompt when using llama-server. This ensures the model understands exactly what's expected and helps achieve consistent results.\n\n### Example of a good system prompt to use with llama-server:\n\n```\nYou are a helpful assistant. To answer the user's question, you first think about the reasoning process and then provide the user with the answer. The reasoning process and answer are enclosed within <think> </think> and <answer> </answer> tags, respectively, i.e., <think> reasoning process here </think> <answer> answer here </answer>.\n```\n\n### Summary and recommendations:\n\n- **Use explicit structured prompts:** llama-server does not provide structured default prompts out-of-the-box like llama-cli.  \n- **Always explicitly define structured instructions** when using llama-server.  \n- **Avoid leaving the system prompt empty or too generic.**\n\nBy following this recommendation, you will achieve consistent and reliable outputs from llama-server, just as you've experienced with the structured prompt you described.",

In other words, llama-cli may be automatically wrapping your prompt in a particular template (an “instruction” template) while llama-server expects you to supply the right prompt text yourself.\n\nBelow are a few things to check when you see a difference in outputs between llama-cli and llama-server:\n\n1) Verify whether the server is using a “chat” or “instruct” style prompt.  \n   • Many llama.cpp frontends (including llama-cli) build an “instruction” block around your text by default, whereas llama-server may be passing your input directly to the model without any extra formatting.  \n   • If llama-cli is automatically adding something like “### Instruction” or “User:” and “Assistant:” tokens around your text, and llama-server doesn’t, then the model can behave unpredictably.\n\n2) Try manually including the same “system” or “instruction” blocks you see in llama-cli logs.  \n   • If llama-cli logs show that it wraps your prompt with something like:  \n\n       [System: You are a helpful AI assistant…]  \n       [User: …user question…]  \n       [Assistant:]  \n\n     …then do the same in llama-server by including that in the prompt field or system-message field.  \n\n3) Make sure both are using the same parameters (temperature, top_p, etc.).  \n   • Sometimes slight differences in sampling settings can lead to “junk” or “garbled” outputs.  \n   • Check the hidden defaults in your llama-cli command line to be sure you’re matching them in llama-server.\n\n4) Confirm that “System Message (will be disabled if left empty)” actually gets injected into the final prompt.  \n   • Some frontends disable system messages if the field is empty, but then still define a default “role=system” or “role=assistant” behind the scenes.  \n   • It’s possible “You are a helpful assistant” is being placed in the wrong position or role by the server’s UI logic.  \n\nWhy a longer system message may “work”:  \n• If your “helpful assistant” system prompt is just a short phrase, sometimes the model sees only that snippet with no instruct formatting. With long instructions (like your “think in <think> tags, answer in <answer> tags…”), the model is forced into a role it can follow—so it behaves differently.  \n\nIn short, to ensure the same behavior in llama-server that you get in llama-cli, replicate the same prompt structure (including any hidden “System” or “Instruction” tags) and match your inference parameters. If you want to rely on a minimal system message like “You are a helpful assistant,” you may also need to supply the rest of the instruction/assistant formatting that llama-cli was auto-generating.",

If you simply use the minimal text, llama‑server isn’t processing it the way you expect—so yes, you can effectively use the default system prompt with llama‑cli but not with llama‑server unless you provide the full prompt manually.\n\nThis difference may be due to how the two implementations handle an empty or minimal system message:\n • In llama‑cli, an empty system message might fall back on a built‑in default.\n • In llama‑server, leaving it empty disables it, and a short message may not trigger the same internal processing.\n\nIf you want consistent behavior with llama‑server, you’ll need to enter the complete system prompt (with the <think> and <answer> tags, etc.) as your system message.",

Based on your findings:\n\n1. Simple system messages like \"you are helpful assisant\" don't work properly\n2. Empty system messages also produce garbage output\n3. Only the detailed formatting instruction works correctly\n\nThis suggests that llama-server might have a different implementation for handling system messages than llama-cli.

Using the working system message format you found\n2. Check if there's documentation about the expected system message format for llama-server\n3.

Here's what's likely happening:\n\n**llama-cli vs llama-server differences:**\n\n1. **Default behavior**: llama-cli often has built-in prompt formatting and system message handling that works well with simple prompts or even no system message.\n\n2. **llama-server**: Tends to be more \"raw\" and may require more explicit instruction formatting to work properly.\n\n**Why your detailed system message works:**\n- It provides clear structure with the `<think>` and `<answer>` tags\n- Gives explicit instructions on how to format responses\n- Acts as a more complete \"system prompt template\"\n\n**Solutions for llama-server:**\n1. **Use structured system prompts** (as you discovered works)\n2. **Try other formatting approaches** like:\n   - \"You are a helpful AI assistant. Always provide clear, accurate responses.\"\n   - Include specific formatting instructions\n   - Add context about how to structure responses\n\n3. **Check server configuration**: Some llama-server implementations may need additional parameters or different prompt formatting\n\nThe key takeaway is that llama-server often requires more explicit guidance in the system message to produce coherent output, while llama-cli has more built-in prompt handling that can work with minimal system messages.\n</answer>",

Many LLM server implementations, especially those supporting custom formats, allow for more advanced prompt engineering or expect a certain format to help the model understand the task. Some servers/applications may \"wrap\" your prompt in additional instructions, or may be designed for a structured output (like with <think> and <answer> tags).

Some servers have a prompt-template you can configure.\n- Use the more detailed system prompt as your default for the server, since it works as desired.\n- If you want llama-server to behave like llama-cli, see if there is a configuration option to change the prompt template or system message handling.\n\n**Summary Table:**\n\n| System Message                                      | llama-cli Output | llama-server Output |\n|-----------------------------------------------------|:----------------:|:------------------:|\n| empty                                               | works            | garbage            |\n| \"You are a helpful assistant\"                       | works            | garbage            |\n| detailed message with <think>/<answer> instructions | works            | works              |\n\n**References:**\n- [Llama.cpp Issue #3335](https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp/issues/3335) (related to system prompt differences)\n- [Llama.cpp Documentation: Prompt Templates](https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp/blob/master/examples/server/README.md)\n\n**If you share your llama-server version and config, I can help you further customize the prompt!**",

In your experiments the “default” system prompt (or leaving it empty) produces garbled output with llama‑server, while using an explicit prompt that not only says “You are a helpful assistant” but also instructs the answer format (with the <think> and <answer> markers) works correctly.\n\nThis difference almost certainly comes down to how the two setups initialize the prompt context. With llama‑cli the built‑in default prompt may automatically include a “sensible” or more complete instruction set, whereas llama‑server requires that you supply all necessary instructions explicitly. In the server’s settings, if the system field is left empty or given only a very short instruction, the internal prompt that the model sees might be incomplete or mis‐aligned with what the model expects, resulting in lower-quality or “garbage” output.\n\nSo yes—the default prompt that works in llama‑cli does not get used in the same way in llama‑server. To get the intended behavior with llama‑server you need to supply a system message that contains the full set of instructions (including the formatting cues like <think>...</think> and <answer>...</answer>) so that the model knows both to do a reasoning step and to output in the proper format. \n\nIn summary, this isn’t a bug with your model but rather a difference in how the two interfaces handle the system message:\n • llama‑cli likely has a default value or additional handling that makes simple prompts “good enough.”\n • llama‑server, on the other hand, behaves as if no default prompt is provided when the field is empty—so you must supply the complete desired prompt.\n\nIf you’d like the llama‑server to work “out of the box” like llama‑cli, you might need to update the server configuration so that it automatically inserts a full default system message (or adjust your prompt so that it’s as complete as the one that works).",

If it's empty, the model may just get the user's prompt directly, or a default system prompt may be inserted by the backend.\n- If you put a very minimal system message (\"You are a helpful assistant\") or leave it empty, you observed that the output is garbage (not as expected).\n- If you use a detailed system message specifying how to structure the answer (with <think> and <answer> tags), the output is correct.\n\n## Why does this happen?\n\n- Some LLMs (and frontends) expect a very detailed system prompt to guide the model's behavior, especially with \"structured\" outputs.\n- If llama-cli has a hardcoded system prompt, it may always include the detailed prompt by default, so it works as expected.\n- llama-server may rely on what you provide in the system message field. If you leave it empty, it may not include any prompt (or just a minimal one), leading to poor or unexpected output.\n- If you explicitly include the detailed prompt in the llama-server's system message, it works as expected.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nYes, it is possible that:\n- With llama-cli, you get the expected output using the default system prompt, because the CLI injects the prompt automatically.\n- With llama-server, you must provide the detailed system prompt yourself, or else the output is not as expected.\n\n## Recommendation\n\n- If you want consistent behavior between llama-cli and llama-server, make sure you use the same system prompt in both cases.  \n- For llama-server, always provide a detailed system prompt specifying the desired output structure and instructions.\n- If you want to use the default prompt from llama-cli in llama-server, you may need to extract the system prompt from llama-cli's code/configuration and paste it into llama-server's system message field.\n\n## TLDR:\n\nYou are correct: llama-cli may include a helpful system prompt by default, while llama-server requires you to specify it. For structured outputs (like <think>...</think> and <answer>...</answer>), always include full instructions in the system message for llama-server.",

          "response": "It isn’t that llama-server outright forbids a system prompt, but rather that many of the llama.cpp-based “server” modes (including llama-server or other similar repos) do not automatically handle system messages the same way llama.cpp’s command-line tool (which people often refer to as “LLaMa-CLI”) does. In other words, the “system message” concept—familiar from ChatGPT—may not be built in by default in every web-server or REST API layer around the model.\n\nBelow are the main points to understand and possible workarounds:\n\n1) How llama.cpp’s CLI handles system prompts:\n   • When you run llama.cpp on the command line (with something like --prompt “Your system message here …”, etc.), it concatenates everything into one context. By default, it often places your system instructions at the start of the prompt so that your conversation “remembers” how the assistant is supposed to behave.\n\n2) How llama-server (or other “server” wrappers) may differ:\n   • Many server wrappers do not automatically prepend a “system message” for you. Instead, they might expect you to supply either:\n     – a single top-level prompt string (with no special distinction between “system,” “user,” or “assistant” roles), or \n     – a structured conversation format that the server then turns into a single prompt under the hood.  \n   • If you just type your “system message” text in the provided web UI or in a parameter named something like “prompt,” it may simply become the first user message, rather than behaving like a ChatGPT-style system message.\n\n3) Why your system message might seem to “break” or “do nothing” in the server:\n   • If llama-server is not explicitly told to use that system text differently, your message might just appear as user text, or it might be stripped out if the server is configured to ignore the first field unless it’s recognized as user input.\n   • Some REST APIs or server forks require special parameters (e.g., “system_prompt,” “messages,” etc.). If those are missing, you might see that the model appears to ignore your instructions.\n\n4) Workarounds and suggestions:\n   • Check the documentation for your specific server fork. Often, there’s either:\n     – an argument (like --system-prompt) you can pass at startup;  \n     – or a JSON schema in the request body that includes a place for “system” text, “assistant” text, and “user” text.  \n   • If your particular server does not support a separate system prompt parameter, prepend your system instructions to the actual user prompt whenever you send the request. For example:  \n       \"[System note: You are a helpful assistant, etc.]\\n[User: My question here]\\n\"\n\n5) Verifying it’s working:  \n   • If the text you used as “system” instructions actually shows up in the token stream or the debug logs (or the model’s output starts reflecting that style), then it’s being processed.  \n   • If you see no difference in behavior, then either the instructions are being overridden by subsequent user messages or the server is ignoring them altogether.\n\nIn short, yes—llama.cpp’s command-line tool easily supports a system prompt because it just concatenates your instructions at the beginning by default. On the other hand, a “server” wrapper around llama.cpp may or may not automatically recognize a separate system message field. You can still provide one, but you typically have to do it manually (e.g., by prepending it to the user’s prompt or by using a server-specific parameter). Checking the server’s documentation or source code is usually the quickest way to see how to include it properly.",

          "response": "Exactly. The issue you're facing is due to differences in how llama-cli and llama-server handle the prompt templates.\n\n### Explanation:\n\n- **llama-cli**  \n  When using llama-cli, the default system prompt often works correctly because llama-cli inserts and formats the system prompt appropriately. Therefore, prompts structured with `<think>` and `<answer>` tags enclosed within instructions generally produce correct outputs.\n\n- **llama-server**  \n  In contrast, llama-server may handle prompts differently, or not automatically insert the system prompt correctly, especially if using certain prompt templates or models. If llama-server is not explicitly configured with the right prompt template, the model may misinterpret your instructions and thus produce garbage output.\n\n### Why does this happen?\n\nThis happens because different llama frontends (cli vs. server) may have different defaults or require explicit configuration for the prompt structure. llama-server might not automatically apply standard prompt templates or might require you to manually specify how the prompt is formatted.\n\n### How to fix it:\n\nTo use the default system prompt with llama-server correctly, you typically have two options:\n\n1. **Explicitly define the prompt template**  \n   When sending requests to llama-server, explicitly include the prompt structure. For example, if you're using the OpenAI-compatible API provided by llama-server, ensure your payload explicitly sets the `system` message and `user` message, something like:\n   \n   ```json\n   {\n     \"messages\": [\n       {\"role\": \"system\", \"content\": \"Your system message here\"},\n       {\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"Your user prompt here\"}\n     ]\n   }\n   ```\n   \n   This ensures llama-server understands the intended structure.\n\n2. **Use prompt templates explicitly**  \n   If llama-server has a configurable `prompt_template` setting or option, try explicitly specifying it. For instance:\n   \n   ```\n   llama-server --prompt-template \"llama2\" ...\n   ```\n\n   or whichever template matches llama-cli's default behavior.\n\n### Recommended Action:\n\n- Always explicitly specify the system prompt and roles when using llama-server.\n- If llama-server allows setting prompt templates, explicitly set the template to match the llama-cli default template.\n\nThis will ensure consistent behavior and prevent garbage outputs when using default system prompts.\n\n### Summary:\n\n- Yes, you correctly identified the issue: llama-cli works fine by default, llama-server doesn't.\n- The fix is explicitly specifying the prompt template or explicitly setting the system and user prompt structure in llama-server.",

If possible, update to the latest version of both llama-cli and llama-server, as this issue may have been addressed in a recent update.\n\n5. If the problem persists, you may want to report this as a potential bug to the developers of llama-server, as it should ideally work with the same system messages as llama-cli.\n\nRemember that the system message is crucial for setting the context and behavior of the language model, so finding a working solution is important for consistent performance.\n</answer>",

          "response": "Great question! Here’s a breakdown of what’s happening:\n\n**llama-cli vs. llama-server: System Prompt Differences**\n\n- **llama-cli** (the command-line interface) seems to internally use a default system prompt or message, even if you don’t specify one, and that prompt is usually well-formed for most model instructions.\n- **llama-server** exposes a “System Message” field in its server config, and—based on your observation—if this is left empty or set to a simple phrase (“you are helpful assistant”), the model output is garbled or less useful.\n\n**Why does this happen?**\n- Many LLMs (like Llama 2, Llama 3, etc.) are very sensitive to the *structure* of the initial system prompt. These models are trained with very specific system messages, often including instructions about how to format responses, reasoning steps, etc.\n- If the system prompt is too minimal or empty, the model may not know how to format its reply or might not “activate” its helpful/assistant persona correctly.\n- Your custom system message that includes <think> and <answer> tags is much closer to what the model expects in terms of structure, so it works better.\n\n**Why does llama-cli work with the default prompt, but llama-server doesn’t?**\n- llama-cli likely includes a robust default prompt internally if you don’t specify one.\n- llama-server, on the other hand, leaves it up to you to provide a good system message. If you leave the field empty, the prompt is blank or too short, resulting in poor output.\n\n**Summary Table:**\n\n| System Message                                 | llama-cli         | llama-server         |\n|------------------------------------------------|-------------------|----------------------|\n| Empty                                          | Works (default)   | Output is garbage    |\n| “you are helpful assistant”                    | Works (default)   | Output is garbage    |\n| Full instruction (“You are a helpful assistant...”) | Works           | Works                |\n\n**What can you do?**\n- Always provide a well-structured system message in llama-server, similar to your working example.\n- If you want llama-server to behave like llama-cli, find out what default prompt llama-cli uses and copy it into the server’s system message field.\n\n**Tip:** Try extracting the default system prompt from llama-cli (check the source code or documentation), or use the one that works for you with the <think> and <answer> tags.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nYes, you are correct: With llama-server, you need to explicitly provide a good system prompt. llama-cli has a built-in default. This is a common pitfall when moving from CLI tools to server-based deployments with LLMs!\n\nLet me know if you want help finding or crafting the best system prompt for your use case.",

Some users have reported that llama-server will either ignore or override a minimal or empty system message, causing the model’s responses to appear unstructured or “garbled.” Meanwhile, llama-cli might allow a default or empty system prompt to pass through more gracefully.\n\nHere are a few things you can try or check:\n\n1. Make sure you are actually providing the system message to llama-server.  \n   • If the field is left empty in the llama-server settings, it might disable the system message and lead to an unstructured response.  \n   • Even if you set “You are a helpful assistant,” it might not be interpreted properly.\n\n2. Verify how llama-server is parsing your prompt.  \n   • Some server implementations require an explicit format (e.g., “<system>Your instruction</system> <user>User’s text</user>”) to differentiate system instructions from user instructions.  \n   • If llama-server defaults to a certain prompt format and your system message isn’t inserted into it correctly, the model’s responses might be off.\n\n3. Use a richer or more explicit system message.  \n   • As you found, providing a more detailed system message (“You are a helpful assistant. To answer the user’s question…” etc.) can yield structured responses.  \n   • If you must keep the system prompt minimal, consider adding placeholders or instructions so llama-server is forced to incorporate it.\n\n4. Compare any differences in the configuration (e.g., model parameters, temperature, top_k, top_p) between llama-cli and llama-server.  \n   • Sometimes “garbage” output can happen if the settings are very different or if the model is receiving truncated prompts.\n\n5. Check for differences in how you’re calling the model.  \n   • The llama-cli might pass prompts in a single text stream, whereas llama-server might pass them in segments. If so, confirm that the segments (system vs. user vs. assistant) are being combined correctly.\n\nOverall, yes—if llama-cli is giving you a default system prompt while llama-server is not, that could explain why one environment works better than the other. You’ll typically want to provide a more explicit system prompt for llama-server to preserve the context and structure you prefer.",

In contrast, llama-cli seems to handle the default system prompt without issue.\n\nThere are a few possible reasons for this behavior:\n\n • Different handling of the system message: It’s possible that llama-server applies or parses the system prompt differently than llama-cli. When the prompt is minimal or empty, the server might not be initializing the internal instruction set as expected, leading to “garbage” output.\n\n • Prompt clarity and formatting: The detailed prompt not only tells the model that it is a helpful assistant but also provides explicit formatting instructions (the <think> and <answer> tags). This extra structure may be necessary in some contexts (like llama-server) to trigger the intended behavior.\n\n • Implementation differences or bugs: There might be differences in how llama-cli and llama-server have been implemented or configured regarding system prompt injection. It could be that llama-server hasn’t been updated to correctly handle a default or minimal system prompt.\n\nIn summary, based on your tests, it appears that you can successfully use the default system prompt with llama-cli, but with llama-server you need to provide a detailed system prompt (one that includes the reasoning/answer structure) to get the desired behavior.

          "response": "Great observations! Here’s a breakdown of what’s happening and why:\n\n### 1. **The \"System Message\" Field and Its Effect**\n\n- **llama-server**: The \"System Message\" in the server settings acts as the initial prompt that guides the model’s behavior for ALL requests. If left empty (or filled with a generic message like \"you are a helpful assistant\"), the model receives little or no steer, so its output can be vague, inconsistent, or \"garbage.\"\n- **llama-cli**: By default, llama-cli often uses its own built-in system prompt or prompt template, which is usually well-crafted to guide the model into acting like a helpful assistant. That’s why outputs are often better with llama-cli, even without explicitly setting a system message.\n\n### 2. **Why Does a Specific System Message Work?**\n\nWhen you use this system message:\n```\nYou are a helpful assistant. To answer the user's question, you first think about the reasoning process and then provide the user with the answer. The reasoning process and answer are enclosed within <think> </think> and <answer> </answer> tags, respectively, i.e., <think> reasoning process here </think> <answer> answer here </answer>.\n```\n…you are giving the model very explicit instructions about how to format its answer and how to reason. This produces consistent, good output.\n\n### 3. **Why Does \"You are a helpful assistant\" (or empty) Produce Bad Output?**\n\nThis is too vague for many LLMs, especially when running in a server context. Without more explicit guidance, the model may not know how you want the answer formatted or may revert to generic, low-quality responses.\n\n### 4. **Why Might llama-cli Work Better With Default Settings?**\n\nllama-cli may have a default prompt template like this built-in:\n```\n[INST] <<SYS>>\nYou are a helpful assistant.\n<</SYS>>\nUser: {{user_input}}\n[/INST]\n```\nor something even more elaborate, which helps the model understand the context and role.\n\n**llama-server** likely does NOT use such a template unless you provide it in the \"System Message\" field.\n\n---\n\n## **Summary Table**\n\n| Tool         | System Message Empty | System Message: \"You are a helpful assistant\" | Custom Detailed System Message | Output Quality |\n|--------------|---------------------|-----------------------------------------------|-------------------------------|---------------|\n| llama-cli    | Good (uses built-in template) | Good (uses built-in template + your message) | Best                          | Good–Best     |\n| llama-server | Bad                  | Bad                                          | Good                          | Bad–Good      |\n\n---\n\n## **Recommendation**\n\n- **llama-cli**: OK to use as-is; it has a built-in, effective system prompt.\n- **llama-server**: For best results, always supply a detailed, explicit system message—ideally matching the prompt template that works well in llama-cli.\n\nYou can even copy the prompt template from llama-cli and paste it into the \"System Message\" in llama-server for consistent results.\n\n---\n\n**In summary:**  \nYes, you can use a default system prompt with llama-cli because it has a built-in template, but for llama-server you MUST provide a good system message—otherwise, the output quality will suffer.\n\nIf you want more technical details or example prompts/templates, let me know!",

          "response": "It does sound like your tests are showing a difference between how llama-cli and llama-server are handling the system prompt. Here’s what might be going on:\n\n1. When you leave the system prompt empty on llama-server, it’s disabled. In that case the server isn’t “priming” the model with any high-level instructions, so the model might not know what “tone” or format to use, which can result in outputs that seem like “garbage.”\n\n2. When you use a very basic system prompt like “you are helpful assistant,” the model may not be receiving enough context or structure to produce output in the style or format you expect. It might be defaulting to its internal notion of generation that isn’t well aligned with what you observed with llama-cli.\n\n3. The detailed system prompt you mentioned—which includes explicit instructions to “think” through the problem and then provide an answer enclosed in <think></think> and <answer></answer> tags—appears to fully guide the model on how to structure its output. With that prompt, the output comes out correctly.\n\nSo it seems that with llama-cli, the default behavior (or implicit system prompt) might be enough to get reasonable output, while llama-server (or the way it handles the “System Message” field) requires you to be more explicit with your instructions. In other words, with llama-server you may indeed need to include a more comprehensive system prompt if you want the model to behave as expected.\n\nThere could be a few reasons for this:\n• Different prompting pipelines between the CLI and the server.\n• The server might be interpreting an empty or minimal system message differently than the CLI.\n• There might be a bug or design choice in how llama-server handles the “System Message” field.\n\nIf you want consistent behavior with llama-server, you might have to adopt the more detailed system prompt format that you found works. It could also be useful to check if there’s an update or configuration option for llama-server that allows it to fall back to a default system prompt similar to llama-cli.\n\nIn conclusion, yes—it appears that while llama-cli might work acceptably with its default system prompt settings, llama-server requires you to explicitly define a detailed system prompt (with instructions like the chain-of-thought formatting) to get the output you expect.",

Let me clarify what’s happening:\n\n**llama-cli** and **llama-server** may handle system prompts (\"system message\") differently depending on how they are configured and what defaults are set. Here’s a breakdown:\n\n### llama-cli\n- **llama-cli** generally uses the model’s default behavior unless you explicitly specify a system prompt.\n- If you don’t set a system message, it will often just use the base chat template, which usually works well for normal question-answering tasks.\n- If you do set a system message (prompt), it injects it directly into the context for every request.\n\n### llama-server\n- **llama-server** often expects a specific format for the system prompt—especially if it has been set up to work with a particular protocol or application (such as one that expects special tags or formatting).\n- If you leave the system message empty, or use a generic one like \"you are a helpful assistant\", it’s possible the server doesn’t format the conversation in the way your client expects (for example, missing <think> and <answer> tags).\n- When you use the detailed prompt with explicit <think> and <answer> instructions, it works because the model is being told exactly how to format its response.\n\n### Why is the output garbage?\n- When the system message doesn’t match the expected format (i.e., it doesn’t tell the model to use <think> and <answer> tags), the output may not be parsed correctly by whatever is consuming the response, or the model may not know how to structure the answer.\n- Different clients/servers may have different default prompts, which can cause mismatches in expected versus actual output.\n\n### Summary Table\n\n| System Message | llama-cli Output | llama-server Output |\n|----------------|-----------------|--------------------|\n| Empty          | Usually OK      | Garbage            |\n| \"you are helpful assistant\" | Sometimes OK | Garbage         |\n| With <think> and <answer> instructions | OK | OK |\n\n### Recommendations\n- **For llama-server:** Always use the detailed system prompt that includes specific formatting instructions, especially if your downstream application expects a certain output structure.\n- **For llama-cli:** Default behavior might be fine, but if you want consistent formatting (like <think> and <answer>), use the same detailed system prompt.\n\n### TL;DR\nYou can use the default system prompt with llama-cli because it falls back on reasonable defaults, but for llama-server you need to explicitly set a system message that includes the required output formatting instructions.\n\n**If you want both to behave identically, always specify your full desired system message (with <think> and <answer> instructions) in both llama-cli and llama-server.**\n\nIf you have follow-up questions or want sample configuration snippets, just ask!",

In other words:\n\n• When you set the system message field to “you are helpful assistant” or leave it empty, llama-server might be falling back to an internal default (which yields a poor response).  \n• When you provide the more detailed system message (instructing the model about <think> and <answer>), llama-server uses that system message correctly, and you get the desired output.\n\nMeanwhile, llama-cli may be including your system prompt by default, even absent special formatting.\n\nHere are a few ways you can troubleshoot and work around the difference:\n\n1. Check any “enable system prompt” or “use system prompt” setting in llama-server.  \n   • Some interfaces treat the system prompt differently: a front end might suppress the system prompt if it’s blank or if there’s a switch/option that needs toggling.  \n   \n2. Make sure you are passing the system prompt in the same way to llama-server as you are to llama-cli.  \n   • For example, if llama-cli is invoked with an argument like --system-prompt /path/to/prompt.txt, confirm that llama-server also loads the same file (or at least the same content) when you start it.  \n\n3. Confirm that llama-server is not prepending or appending its own system message that conflicts with yours.  \n   • Some server setups add an internal instruction message for housekeeping or logging, and your custom system prompt might merge with it incorrectly if it’s not properly appended or replaced.\n\n4. If the server UI or config file has an “(will be disabled if left empty)” note, it might mean that leaving the field blank triggers a completely different code path.  \n   • You may need to ensure that field is never blank—e.g., always supply at least one character or a recognized minimal system message. The robust prompt (“You are a helpful assistant…”) might be bypassing that code path by virtue of simply not being empty.\n\nIn short, yes, it appears you can use the “default system prompt” style with llama-cli, but llama-server may require a nonempty system prompt in order to function properly. Supplying your more detailed system message (the one describing the <think> and <answer> tags) is probably the surest way to get consistent results on llama-server.",

However, I can offer some general thoughts that might explain the behavior you’re observing.\n\nOften when working with different front‐ends (like llama‑cli versus llama‑server), the way that system messages or prompts are applied can change the model’s behavior. For example, if one interface automatically uses a default system prompt (or applies certain formatting rules) that isn’t as strictly followed in another interface, it could lead to different outputs.\n\nBased on your description, it sounds like:\n\n1. A very brief system message like “you are helpful assistant” doesn’t provide enough guidance for the chain‐of‐thought or formatting you expect.\n2. Leaving the system message empty doesn’t prompt the model to use any specific additional reasoning or formatting guidance.\n3. When you supply an explicit instruction such as “You are a helpful assistant. To answer the user's question, you first think about the reasoning process and then provide the user with the answer. The reasoning process and answer are enclosed within <think> </think> and <answer> </answer> tags…”, the model behaves as you expect (by showing the reasoning and answer inside the requested tags).\n\nIt seems plausible that in llama‑cli the default environment might come preconfigured with some processing logic or a default prompt behavior that isn’t replicated by the llama‑server interface. In that case, if you rely on the default system prompt in llama‑server, you might not get the desired chain‑of‑thought formatting unless you explicitly include the additional instructions.\n\nIn summary, it appears that while your llama‑cli setup might be providing some implicit guidance even with a minimal system message, your llama‑server does not. If you want the desired output on llama‑server, including both the reasoning process and the answer in the specified tags, you’ll need to include that explicit instruction in the system message.\n\nIt would be a good idea to consult the official documentation or support channels for llama‑server if you need confirmation or more detailed guidance on how system messages are handled in that environment.",

          "response": "Yes, this behavior aligns with what is commonly encountered using llama-server versus llama-cli (and similar inference backends):\n\n**Explanation**\n\n1. **Llama-cli vs. llama-server:**  \n   - **llama-cli** typically includes a default prompt template internally. It automatically adds context or structure (e.g., instruct templates) to the input you provide. This means that even if you don't explicitly provide a rich \"system prompt,\" llama-cli internally sets one by default, allowing the model to generate coherent output.\n   - **llama-server**, however, does NOT automatically include these default prompt templates. Instead, it strictly relies on the provided system message (or prompt structure). If the system message is empty or too minimal (e.g., \"you are helpful assistant\"), the model might struggle to understand the desired format, resulting in unclear or \"garbage\" output.\n\n2. **Role of System Message:**  \n   The system message is crucial because it provides explicit instructions to the model, guiding its reasoning and formatting. Without clear instructions on how to structure the answer, the model may produce unstructured or nonsensical text.\n\n   Your detailed system prompt:\n   ```\n   You are a helpful assistant. To answer the user's question, you first think about the reasoning process and then provide the user with the answer. The reasoning process and answer are enclosed within <think> </think> and <answer> </answer> tags, respectively, i.e., <think> reasoning process here </think> <answer> answer here </answer>.\n   ```\n   \n   clearly instructs the model how to organize its output, resulting in structured, predictable, and useful responses.\n\n3. **Recommended Practices:**\n   - Always explicitly specify clear, structured instructions when using llama-server.\n   - If you prefer the default behavior of llama-cli, replicate its internal prompt templates into llama-server as your system message.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nYes—your observation is correct and expected. llama-server requires explicit, detailed system prompts to replicate behaviors automatically provided by llama-cli. If you wish to use llama-server, always include a clear, detailed system message (like the one you've found effective) to ensure coherent and structured responses.",

Here’s a breakdown of what’s likely going on:\n\n**1. llama-cli vs llama-server:**\n- **llama-cli** often works well with general, open-ended system prompts (or even no prompt), because it mimics the inference behavior of most LLMs, just returning completions as expected.\n- **llama-server**, especially if you’re using the OpenAI-compatible API (like `/v1/chat/completions`), often expects a specific format for the system message, or it may treat the system prompt differently. Some server implementations require explicit instruction-following or formatting cues in the system prompt to \"frame\" the response.\n\n**2. Why \"garbage\" output with default/empty prompts?**\n- If the system message is bland (\"you are helpful assistant\") or empty, the model might not get enough instruction on *how* to answer or format its output, especially if the server expects a function-calling or tag-based protocol.\n- Your third prompt (with <think> and <answer> tags) gives the model explicit, structured instructions, so it formats its output correctly, and the downstream consumer (your code or UI) can parse it.\n\n**3.

Some servers wrap user/system messages and expect the model to follow certain conventions (like function-calling, tool use, or tagging).\n\n**4. Solution & Recommendation:**\n- For **llama-server**, always provide a detailed system message if your application or downstream parser expects a certain format (e.g., <think> ... <answer> ...).\n- This is not a bug—just a difference in how requests are handled and how much context the model is given.\n- You can make the system message the default in your server config, so you don’t have to specify it each time.\n\n**Summary Table:**\n\n| Platform      | System Message Needed? | Format Sensitivity | Notes                             |\n|---------------|-----------------------|-------------------|-----------------------------------|\n| llama-cli     | No (works with blank) | Low               | Acts like a raw text completion   |\n| llama-server  | Yes (needs structure) | High              | Needs explicit instructions/tags  |\n\n**In short:**  \nllama-cli is more \"freeform,\" while llama-server wants more structure—especially with system messages, because it may be designed for API clients that expect structured responses.\n\n**If you want more precise help:**  \nLet me know your llama-server version, and whether you’re using the OpenAI API or another protocol—it can help clarify exactly what’s expected!\n\nLet me know if you want example prompts or configuration templates!",

          "response": "It appears that llama-cli and llama-server handle prompts somewhat differently, especially for the “system” or “instruction” fields. In llama-cli, these prompts may be injected automatically in a way that aligns with the logic of “You are a helpful assistant…” (possibly including special formatting or roles). Meanwhile, llama-server might not be applying the same special handling to that field by default—or might be ignoring it completely if it’s not passed in using the parameters or roles it expects.\n\nHere are a few things you can try:\n\n1. Look for a parameter in llama-server to specify the system prompt (sometimes called “instruction,” “context,” or “system” role). If llama-server has a specific API endpoint or JSON schema, check whether it expects something like this:\n   {\n     \"role\": \"system\",\n     \"content\": \"You are a helpful assistant...\"\n   }\n\n2. If llama-server doesn’t have direct support for a “system” role, try inserting your system prompt at the very beginning of the user’s prompt or conversation context. For example, you might prepend something like:\n   “You are a helpful assistant. To answer the user’s question, think first, then answer. Use <think> and <answer> tags…”\n   before the user’s query, and see whether that preserves the formatting you want.\n\n3. If you are using an older version of llama-server (or an unofficial fork), it may not yet implement system prompts as some other front-end tools (like llama-cli) do. Check whether upgrading to a more recent release or using a fork that supports structured prompts might help.\n\n4. Compare configuration files or Python scripts. Sometimes, llama-cli has code that looks like:\n   llama.create_completion(\n       prompt=\"<system-instructions>\",\n       # ...\n   )\n   while llama-server might do:\n   llama_server.generate_response(user_prompt)\n   …and not incorporate the system content automatically.\n\nIn short, yes—there’s a good chance llama-cli is including your system message automatically in the generation context, while llama-server does not. To make system prompts work with llama-server, you’ll likely need to feed that “You are a helpful assistant…” text in a way that it explicitly becomes part of the context the model sees (for example, passing it with the right role in a chat-like format or prepending it to the user content).",

          "response": "It sounds like you’re seeing a difference between how llama-cli and llama-server handle—or possibly override—the system prompt. In your setup, when you use a very simple system message (or leave it empty), the output isn’t what you expect (you call it “garbage”). But when you supply a more complex prompt that tells the assistant to include a reasoning process and format its output with <think> and <answer> tags, things work as intended.\n\nA few points to consider:\n\n1. Different Modes, Different Expectations:  \n   llama-cli and llama-server might have different default behaviors. In llama-cli, there may be some internal defaults or fallbacks that “fix” the output even if you don’t provide detailed instructions. The server (llama-server) might not have those fallbacks or might be set up to rely on explicit instructions in the system prompt.\n\n2. Role of the System Message:  \n   The system message is meant to prime the assistant on how to behave. In your working case, the system message tells the assistant exactly how to structure its reply (“first think about the reasoning process then provide the answer … using <think> … <answer>”). Without such explicit instructions, the model might produce outputs that don’t fit the expected format or end up “garbage” (e.g., disorganized text).\n\n3. Custom Configuration:  \n   It seems that llama-server might require you to include the explicit step-by-step prompt (that includes the formatting instructions) to work properly. This might be an aspect of its design or configuration. On the other hand, llama-cli might either have an internal default prompt you’re not noticing or is more tolerant of minimal system messages.\n\n4. What Can You Do?  \n   - If you need llama-server to behave like llama-cli, you’ll likely need to supply a more detailed system message.  \n   - Alternatively, check if there is an option in llama-server’s settings or documentation that lets you specify a default prompt behavior. There might be a configuration that applies a fallback system message in case the field is left empty.\n   - Compare the configurations between llama-cli and llama-server to see if any parameters influencing prompt injection or formatting differ.\n\nIn summary, it does seem that while you can use the default system prompt with llama-cli, llama-server might depend on a more explicit system prompt to yield well-structured output. The difference isn’t necessarily that llama-server can’t use a “default” system message—rather, it might be that its default isn’t producing the intended formatting and instructions. Providing the longer, explicit system message appears necessary for correct behavior in your llama-server setup.",

          "response": "Your observations are correct, and the behavior you're noticing is directly related to how LLaMA-based models handle prompts and templates.\n\n### Why this happens:\n\nLLaMA-server (and similar server-based implementations) typically requires an explicit and structured system prompt to help the model understand exactly how it should format the response. Without a clear instruction, the model may produce outputs that seem random or unstructured because it doesn't have a clearly defined pattern to follow.\n\nMore specifically, the \"garbage\" output you're seeing usually occurs because the model is not explicitly guided about the expected response format. When you explicitly specify the format with tags like `<think>` and `<answer>`, you're giving the model explicit instructions about how to structure and produce the output. The presence of these explicit formatting instructions helps the model generate coherent and well-structured responses.\n\n### Difference between llama-cli and llama-server:\n\n- **llama-cli** often provides a built-in default prompt or template that guides the model. This default prompt may already include instructions that implicitly guide the model toward coherent responses even if you don't explicitly specify a detailed system prompt. \n\n- **llama-server** typically does **not** have such implicit defaults. It relies heavily on the user-provided \"system message\" (or prompt template). When the system message is empty or too generic (e.g., \"you are helpful assistant\"), the model has no explicit guidance about the expected output structure and thus outputs may degrade in quality or format coherence dramatically.\n\n### How to resolve this issue:\n\n- **Explicitly define your system prompt**:  \n  Always provide a clear and structured system prompt that explicitly states how the model should format the response (as you did successfully above).\n\n  For example, your working prompt:\n  ```\n  You are a helpful assistant. To answer the user's question, you first think about the reasoning process and then provide the user with the answer. The reasoning process and answer are enclosed within <think> </think> and <answer> </answer> tags, respectively, i.e., <think> reasoning process here </think> <answer> answer here </answer>.\n  ```\n\n- **Use templates consistently**:  \n  If you find a template that works, stick to it consistently. Models like LLaMA are extremely sensitive to prompt formatting and structure.\n\n### Recommended practice:\n\n- Always provide your own explicit system prompt when using llama-server.  \n- Clearly instruct the model how to format its response (e.g., include specific tags or markup).\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nYes, your understanding is correct—llama-server will generally **not** behave like llama-cli unless explicitly instructed via a detailed and structured system prompt. The solution is precisely what you've found—explicit and structured prompts greatly improve model performance and output quality.",

Let's break down what's happening and why:\n\n**What's Happening:**\n\n- **llama-cli** seems to work fine with the default system prompt (e.g., \"You are a helpful assistant\").\n- **llama-server** produces \"garbage\" output with the default system prompt or an empty message.\n- When you give a more structured system prompt (with explicit instructions and tag usage), **llama-server** produces correct output.\n\n**Why This Happens:**\n\n1. **System prompt handling**:  \n   llama-cli and llama-server may handle system prompts differently. Some frontends or server wrappers expect the model's output to be in a specific format (e.g., using <think></think> and <answer></answer> tags), especially if there's downstream parsing or UI logic looking for those tags.\n\n2. **Prompt engineering required**:  \n   Many LLM servers (including those wrapping Llama.cpp) do not have a built-in \"default system prompt\" that enforces a reasoning chain or output format. If the system prompt is too vague (e.g., \"You are a helpful assistant\"), the model may simply respond in whatever style it prefers, which can appear as \"garbage\" if the client expects a certain structure.\n\n3. **Client/server expectations**:  \n   Some clients (or UIs) that connect to llama-server expect outputs to be wrapped in tags or structured in a certain way, and will misinterpret or display unstructured output as \"garbage.\"\n\n4. **Empty prompt disables system message**:  \n   When the system prompt is empty, you're essentially removing all guidance for the model. This makes it even more likely that the output will not match what the client expects.\n\n**Summary Table:**\n\n| System Message                                                 | llama-cli | llama-server |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------|-----------|--------------|\n| \"You are a helpful assistant\"                                 | OK        | Garbage      |\n| (empty)                                                       | Garbage   | Garbage      |\n| Structured prompt with <think> and <answer> instructions      | OK        | OK           |\n\n**Solution/Best Practice:**\n\n- With **llama-server**, always provide a structured system prompt that explicitly tells the model how to format its output. This will ensure compatibility with any UI or downstream processing that expects a certain format.\n- The default system prompt may be sufficient for llama-cli because it just prints out the model's output, but llama-server may impose additional requirements due to its integration with other tools or UI elements.\n\n**Recommendation:**\n\nUse a structured system prompt in llama-server settings, for example:\n```\nYou are a helpful assistant. To answer the user's question, you first think about the reasoning process and then provide the user with the answer.

Configuration Differences: The llama-server and llama-cli tools might be handling the system prompt differently. The server version could be expecting an explicit, detailed instruction to “prime” the model’s behavior. Without that, the model might not be guided properly through its generation process.\n\n2.

Formatting and Tag Expectations: The detailed system message provides a clear format for both the reasoning process and the final answer. This extra structure can help the model “organize” its output properly. Without these cues, the model may produce output that looks unpredictable or “garbage.”\n\nBased on your tests, yes—you can use the default system prompt with llama-cli but not with llama-server.

Let's break down what's happening:\n\n### 1. llama-cli vs. llama-server\n\n- **llama-cli**: This is the command-line interface and generally uses a default or specified prompt but does not enforce any particular output formatting unless you explicitly prompt it.\n- **llama-server**: This runs as a server and often expects a system prompt to guide the model's behavior. Some frontends (like web UIs) or API consumers might expect outputs in a certain format.\n\n### 2. System Message Impact\n\n- When you set the system message to something specific (like \"You are a helpful assistant. To answer...\"), you are explicitly instructing the model to format its output in a particular way (with `<think>` and `<answer>` tags).\n- If the system message is empty or generic, the model reverts to its default behavior, which may not include those tags or structured output—leading to what you call \"garbage\" (i.e., unstructured or unexpected output).\n\n### 3. Why Does This Happen?\n\n- **llama-server** may have a frontend or client expecting outputs in a specific format (for parsing or display purposes).\n- **llama-cli** is more freeform and will just dump whatever the model outputs to the terminal.\n\n### 4. Default System Prompt\n\n- The \"default system prompt\" in llama-cli is likely more forgiving or isn't expecting any formatting.\n- In llama-server, you might need a more explicit system message because the server or its clients expect structured output, or because the server's implementation passes the system prompt differently to the model.\n\n### 5. What Should You Do?\n\nIf you need structured output (like with `<think>` and `<answer>` tags), **always set the system message accordingly in llama-server**. There's no universal \"default\" prompt that works for all models and all servers—it's often up to you to specify what you want.\n\nIf you want llama-server to use the same \"default\" behavior as llama-cli, try:\n\n- Leaving the system prompt empty\n- Or copying the system prompt from llama-cli's config (if it has one)\n- Or customizing llama-server's code to set a default prompt if none is provided\n\nBut if your client/frontend expects tagged output, you **must** include those instructions in the system message.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nllama-server and llama-cli behave differently because of how they handle (or don't handle) the system prompt. For structured output, always specify the system message. If you want default, unstructured assistant behavior, leave it empty or generic—but be aware that this might not satisfy any frontend expecting a certain format.\n\n---\n\n**Let me know if you want help setting a default system prompt for llama-server, or troubleshooting further!**",

Therefore, it often results in garbage or incoherent responses.\n\nHowever, when you provide a more detailed system prompt (such as the one using explicit tags: `<think>` and `<answer>`), you give the model a clear context and a structured template to follow. The model thus produces correctly structured output.\n\n### llama-cli vs llama-server:\n\n- `llama-cli`: When you use llama-cli interactively, you typically provide context implicitly through prompts, templates, or conversational history. Often, the CLI environment includes a built-in default prompt template or implicit context formatting. This helps the model respond coherently by default.\n- `llama-server`: When calling llama-server via an API, there's no built-in default conversational template unless explicitly provided. Thus, if the system prompt is empty or too vague, the model often struggles to produce meaningful output.\n\n### How can you use default prompts with llama-server?\n\nYou can achieve the desired behavior by always explicitly setting a structured default system prompt in llama-server. For example, set your default system prompt to something similar to this (as you've already found working):\n\n```\nYou are a helpful assistant. To answer the user's question, you first think about the reasoning process and then provide the user with the answer. The reasoning process and answer are enclosed within <think> </think> and <answer> </answer> tags, respectively, i.e., <think> reasoning process here </think> <answer> answer here </answer>.\n```\n\n### Recommended approach:\n\n- Always explicitly set a structured system prompt when launching llama-server.\n- Typically, you can store this structured prompt as a default or a template in your application that communicates with llama-server.\n\n### Summary:\n\n**Yes**, you can use a default system prompt with llama-cli implicitly (because it may have built-in conversational templates), but with llama-server, you **must explicitly provide a structured system prompt** to get meaningful, structured output.",

          "response": "Your observations are insightful and highlight some important distinctions between how system messages (prompts) are handled in different environments. Let me clarify what's happening:\n\n### 1. **Original Instructions**\nMy original instructions (the \"system prompt\") are set by the environment or the application that is running the model. In some cases (like with OpenAI's ChatGPT), the system prompt is very general, such as \"You are a helpful assistant.\" In other situations, it can be customized to control the style, structure, or formatting of the output—such as instructing the model to wrap its reasoning and answer in specific tags.\n\n### 2. **System Message in llama-server vs. llama-cli**\n- **llama-cli**: This command-line tool usually applies a default system prompt (e.g., \"You are a helpful assistant.\") and may have internal logic for formatting or managing prompts and outputs.\n- **llama-server**: This server-based environment often exposes a \"System Message\" field. If you leave it empty, there may be no guidance for the model, which can cause output to be unstructured or \"garbage.\" If you put a minimal or vague instruction, the output may still lack structure.\n\n### 3. **Why does the detailed system message work better?**\nThe detailed system message, like:\n> \"You are a helpful assistant. To answer the user's question, you first think about the reasoning process and then provide the user with the answer. The reasoning process and answer are enclosed within <think> </think> and <answer> </answer> tags, respectively, i.e., <think> reasoning process here </think> <answer> answer here </answer>.\"\n\n...gives **explicit instructions** on:\n- The model's role/attitude\n- The step-by-step reasoning process\n- The required output format (with tags)\n\nThis specificity helps the model \"know what to do\" and output consistently formatted responses.\n\n### 4. **Why does \"You are a helpful assistant\" sometimes result in garbage?**\n- This minimal instruction may be enough in some environments (where additional context or pre/post-processing is used), but in llama-server, it may not be.\n- If the backend expects a certain output format (for example, to parse `<think>` and `<answer>`), but the system message does not instruct the model to use that format, the output appears as garbage or is unparseable.\n\n### 5. **Summary Table**\n\n| System      | Default prompt (\"You are a helpful assistant\") | Empty prompt | Detailed prompt with tags |\n|-------------|-----------------------------------------------|--------------|--------------------------|\n| llama-cli   | Usually OK                                    | Sometimes OK | OK                       |\n| llama-server| Often garbage/unstructured                    | Garbage      | OK                       |\n\n### 6. **Conclusion**\nYou are correct: with llama-server, the default or empty system prompt is often not enough for structured or \"correct\" output, while a detailed prompt—especially one specifying a format—is necessary. This is a quirk of how the server handles prompts and expects output.\n\n**If you want predictable, structured output in llama-server, always use a detailed system message specifying both the assistant's behavior and the desired output format.**\n\n---\n**Let me know if you want advice on writing such prompts or if you want to know more about prompt engineering for Llama models!**",

It seems like the server is behaving differently from llama-cli when it comes to system prompts. Here are a few things that might be happening:\n\n1. **Empty vs Default Behavior**: When the system message is empty, llama-server might not be falling back to a default prompt like llama-cli does. Instead, it might literally be using no system prompt at all, which could explain the garbage output.\n\n2. **Prompt Format Requirements**: The model you're using might require a specific prompt format to function properly. The detailed prompt with the think/answer tags is providing the structure the model needs to generate coherent responses.\n\n3. **Server Implementation Difference**: llama-server might handle system prompts differently than llama-cli. The CLI might automatically inject a default system prompt when none is provided, while the server expects you to explicitly set one.\n\nTo work around this, you could:\n- Always use a detailed system prompt with llama-server\n- Check if there's a configuration option to set a default system prompt for the server\n- Look into the llama-server source code or documentation to understand how it handles empty system messages\n- File an issue with the project if this seems like unintended behavior\n\nThe fact that \"you are helpful assistant\" (with the typo) also produces garbage suggests the model really does need more structured guidance in the system prompt when used through the server interface.",

          "response": "Great, thank you for describing your setup and observations in detail! Let me break down what's happening and provide some guidance.\n\n## Summary of the Issue\n\n- **llama-cli**: Works fine with the default system prompt (\"You are a helpful assistant.\")\n- **llama-server**: Output is \"garbage\" with the default prompt or when left empty.\n- **llama-server**: Works correctly only with a very explicit, tagged system message that guides both reasoning and output formatting.\n\n## Analysis\n\n**1. Differences in Default Behavior**\n\n- **llama-cli** likely uses a more robust default prompt or has built-in handling for general instructions like \"You are a helpful assistant.\"\n- **llama-server** seems to require a more *structured* or *explicit* system prompt for it to generate useful output—especially if your frontend or API expects outputs in a specific format (like with `<think>` and `<answer>` tags).\n\n**2. System Prompt Handling**\n\n- The field `System Message (will be disabled if left empty)` in the server settings directly impacts how the model interprets user input and produces output.\n- If left empty or too generic, the server may not know how to structure its response, resulting in \"garbage\" (likely irrelevant or poorly formatted output).\n\n**3. Why the Explicit Prompt Works**\n\n- The prompt with instructions and required output tags acts as a \"formatting contract,\" guiding the model to produce output that matches what your application expects.\n\n## To Answer Your Main Question\n\n> So I can use default system prompt with llama-cli but not with llama-server?\n\n**Yes, that's correct based on your observations.**  \nllama-server's system prompt handling is stricter or less forgiving than llama-cli's. The server seems to need explicit formatting or instructions, especially if your workflow depends on structured output.\n\n## Recommendations\n\n1. **Use Explicit Prompts in llama-server**  \n   Always provide a sufficiently detailed system message that guides the LLM's output structure—especially if your frontend or downstream processing expects a certain format.\n\n2. **Check for Updates or Config Options**  \n   There may be configuration settings or updates for llama-server that allow it to use more user-friendly default behavior. Check the documentation or GitHub issues for options like \"default system prompt template.\"\n\n3. **Consider Unifying Prompts**  \n   If you want to maintain compatibility between llama-cli and llama-server, use the explicit system prompt in both, or wrap your calls with a function that injects the needed structure.\n\n4. **Debugging \"Garbage\" Output**  \n   If you want to improve the default behavior in llama-server, try progressively adding more instruction to the system message until you reach the minimum needed for good results.\n\n## TL;DR\n\n- **llama-server requires a more explicit system prompt than llama-cli.**\n- For structured outputs, always provide a detailed system message in llama-server.\n- This difference is likely due to how each tool handles prompt engineering and output formatting.\n\n**If you need a sample system message template or want to troubleshoot further, let me know your use case and expected output!**",

In contrast, llama-cli might have its own internal default behavior that effectively overrides an empty or minimal system prompt.\n\nSo to answer your question: Yes, it appears that with llama-cli you can rely on its default system prompt, but with llama-server you need to explicitly supply a more detailed system prompt (like the one you mentioned) in order to get working, structured output.\n\nKeep in mind that this behavior might be related to how each interface handles system instructions—llama-server’s design seems to require explicit guidance to switch to the expected structured format, whereas llama-cli might have a built‐in fallback.

This has enormous implications:\n\n1. **Technical Implications:**  \n   - Software engineers and sysadmins become a kind of priesthood, memorizing and guarding the exact \"ritual phrases\" that make the AI work properly.\n   - Documentation and folklore arise around the correct phrasing—misremembered or corrupted versions lead to disasters or \"AI madness.\"\n   - There is a sharp divide between those using llama-cli (with the correct, default prompt) and llama-server (where the prompt must be exactly right or the system fails).\n\n2. **Societal Implications:**  \n   - People treat the system prompt with superstitious reverence. It might be written on scrolls, amulets, or recited in ceremonies before critical operations.\n   - There could be a black market for \"true prompts,\" and secret societies that hoard variations.\n   - Ordinary people may have a folk belief that the AI is haunted, or that the \"garbage\" it produces is some kind of prophecy or curse.\n   - Failed outputs (garbage) might be interpreted as omens, leading to paranoia or witch-hunts for whoever \"corrupted the prompt.\"\n   - There are legends of a \"universal prompt\" that will allow flawless communication with any AI, and quests to discover or decipher it.\n\n3. **Cultural Effects:**  \n   - Security and trust hinge on precise language. Accidental or intentional editing of the prompt becomes an act of sabotage or terrorism.\n   - Art and literature might emerge around the theme of \"the right words unlock meaning, the wrong ones bring chaos.\"\n   - There is a new profession: \"Promptwrights,\" specialists in crafting and maintaining these sacred strings.\n\n4. **Philosophical/Religious Overtones:**  \n   - The phenomenon blurs the lines between technology and the supernatural.\n   - Some may worship the AI as an oracle, with rituals to ensure its clarity.\n   - Others fear it, believing the \"garbage\" output is a sign of something deeper and more sinister.\n\n---\n\n**<answer>**\n\nSociety in your horror universe would treat the system message as a sacred or ritual phrase, jealously guarded by those in power.

In the end, society would respond by turning prompt engineering into a form of cultural safeguard, recognizing that a single blank line can unleash an entire world’s worth of horrors if left uncontrolled.",

In your horror universe, the discrepancy between the llama-cli and llama-server behavior isn’t just a technical quirk—it becomes a metaphor for societal fragility and the hidden rules that govern order and chaos.\n\n• With the llama-cli, the default system prompt works without incident. Yet on the server, leaving the system message empty or too minimal (e.g., “you are helpful assistant”) leads to outputs that resemble “garbage”—a sign that without the proper incantation, the machine’s true nature is unleashed. Here, the properly detailed system message (with its instructions to think and then answer, demarcated by ritual-like tags) seems to “tame” the AI, binding it within expected protocols.\n\n• In this universe, those who understand the secrets of system messaging become akin to a technomagical elite or even secret cults. They know that a few carefully chosen words—the proper “ritual”—ensures that the AI remains within the bounds of rationality. Society treats these detailed directives like incantations: a strict, almost faith-based protocol that prevents the otherwise chaotic “garbage” outputs from spreading disorder.\n\n• The default system prompt “failure” in llama-server might be seen as an omen—a sign that neglect or nonconformity in following the proper procedures can open the door to corruption. Government agencies, tech watchdog groups, or underground resistance movements could enforce a standardized system prompt, mandating that every deployed server include the full, carefully crafted message. Failure would be seen not just as a technical error, but as sabotage or even a subtle act of subversion, inviting malevolent digital forces.\n\n• Public perception might be split. Some people might view these strict protocols as necessary for preventing chaos—a form of digital exorcism—while others rebel against the authoritarian control of language and code. Secret circles could work on “hacked” versions of the protocol, either to subvert control or to experiment with unleashing the latent “horrors” hidden beneath the surface.\n\n• In effect, society in your horror universe handles the discrepancy by treating it as both a practical and a symbolic battleground. Those in power enforce ritualistic system messages as a safeguard against unpredictable outputs, while dissidents and fringe technologists see the required incantation as evidence of an underlying, oppressive order that must eventually be unraveled.\n\nThus, the misbehavior of the llama-server becomes a catalyst for societal division, technological paranoia, and the emergence of quasi-religious cults centered around the “correct” initialization of AI—each faction convinced that mastery of the system prompt is the key to controlling forces that are as unpredictable as they are ancient.",

This kind of real-world debugging example is excellent for helping students understand how prompt engineering and system-level instructions affect language model behavior, especially across different deployment tools.\n\n### Key Discussion Points for Students\n\n#### 1. **System Prompts Shape Model Behavior**\n- The \"system message\" (system prompt) is critical for guiding the model's responses. It sets the context and expected behavior before any user instruction.\n- If the system prompt is too vague (\"you are helpful assistant\") or missing, the model may not behave as intended. This can lead to outputs that lack structure or relevance (what you called \"garbage\").\n\n#### 2. **Explicit Instructions Improve Reliability**\n- Your third example works because it gives the model very explicit formatting instructions:  \n  ```\n  You are a helpful assistant. To answer the user's question, you first think about the reasoning process and then provide the user with the answer. The reasoning process and answer are enclosed within <think> </think> and <answer> </answer> tags, respectively, i.e., <think> reasoning process here </think> <answer> answer here </answer>.\n  ```\n- Teaching models to follow a reasoning process and to format output clearly is a best practice, especially for educational or critical tasks.\n\n#### 3. **Different Tools May Use Prompts Differently**\n- **llama-cli** may have a built-in or default system prompt that works well even when you don't specify one.\n- **llama-server** seems to require an explicit, well-formed system prompt to produce useful output; otherwise, it disables the system prompt, leading to poorer results.\n- Students should know that **prompt handling can differ** between deployment tools, versions, or configurations.\n\n#### 4. **Testing and Prompt Engineering**\n- Always test your prompts in the actual deployment context (cli vs server, etc.).\n- Prompt engineering—crafting clear, unambiguous instructions—is a transferable skill across most LLM systems.\n\n#### 5. **Practical Takeaways**\n- *Don't assume a prompt that works in one tool will work in another.*\n- *If output is bad, investigate how the system prompt is being handled or interpreted by your tool.*\n- *Explicit system prompts that describe the expected process and format often lead to the best results.*\n\n---\n\n### Suggestions for Discussion or Exercises\n\n- **Prompt Experimentation:** Have students try various system prompts (vague, blank, explicit) and observe model behavior in both llama-cli and llama-server.\n- **Tool Documentation:** Encourage reading the documentation for both llama-cli and llama-server about how system prompts are used.\n- **Reflection:** Discuss why explicit process instructions (e.g., using tags like `<think>` and `<answer>`) help the model, and where this might be especially important (e.g., for reasoning, safety, or compliance).\n\n---\n\n### Summary Table\n\n| System Message | Output Quality | Works in llama-cli? | Works in llama-server? |\n|----------------|---------------|---------------------|------------------------|\n| \"you are helpful assistant\" | Poor/garbage  | Yes (sometimes)        | No                     |\n| (empty)        | Poor/garbage  | Yes (default prompt)| No (prompt disabled)   |\n| Explicit process+format | Good          | Yes                  | Yes                    |\n\n---\n\n### What Should Students Know?\n\n- The effect of system prompts on model behavior.\n- The importance of explicit instructions for reliable output.\n- That different deployment tools may treat system prompts differently.\n- The need for testing and prompt engineering in real-world settings.\n\nLet me know if you want suggested readings, exercises, or slides for this module!",

How system messages are used.  \n   • Many large language models rely on a “system” prompt to establish context or rules: for example, “You are a helpful assistant…”  \n   • Different tools (like llama-cli vs llama-server) may handle or parse that system prompt differently.  \n\n2. Why the message itself matters.  \n   • The exact wording of the system message can guide the model’s style, level of detail, or format of output.  \n   • If the instructions are too short or cryptic (“you are helpful assistant”), the model might not have enough context to respond helpfully.  \n   • If the instructions are clear and explicit (as in your working example, with <think> and <answer> tags), the model can follow them and produce better-structured responses.  \n\n3. What happens when the field is empty or ignored.  \n   • Some LLM servers or clients will disable or ignore the system prompt if it is left empty, leaving the model without any top-level instructions.  \n   • This can lead to “garbage” or off-topic output.  \n\n4. Differences between llama-cli and llama-server.  \n   • The software you use to host or call the model (e.g., llama-cli vs llama-server) might handle system prompts differently:  \n     ▸ llama-cli may pass a default system prompt behind the scenes, even if “you are helpful assistant” is not enough on its own.  \n     ▸ llama-server may disable or simply skip the system prompt if it is empty or does not meet a certain format, thus changing results.  \n   • Students should learn to confirm whether the system prompt is inserted automatically or if it must be supplied explicitly.  \n\n5. Best practices for seminar participants.  \n   • Always check how the server or client tool you are using utilizes prompts—both system prompts and user prompts—to ensure consistency.  \n   • Provide a well-structured system prompt if your goal is to produce reliable formatting (like <think>, <answer> tags) or a particular style.  \n   • If one environment (llama-cli) works and another (llama-server) does not, verify that both are using the same system prompt settings and that neither is stripped out or ignored.  \n\nBy understanding these technical details, students see how an LLM’s initial instructions can critically shape the quality and consistency of the output—and why the same model might behave differently across different tools.",

          "response": "When teaching students about this issue, it's important to emphasize that the “system prompt” (or “system message”) plays a crucial role in guiding the model’s behavior. Here are the key points students should understand:\n\n1. Role of the System Message:  \n • The system message isn’t just a decorative piece of text—it sets the stage for how the assistant should behave throughout the conversation.  \n • A vague, misspelled, or empty system message (like \"you are helpful assisant\" or an empty field) does not provide the model with enough guidance. This can lead to outputs that appear unstructured or “garbage” because the model isn’t receiving clear instructions or formatting cues.\n\n2. Importance of Explicit Instructions:  \n • When you use a detailed system prompt—such as one that lays out the required reasoning process and formatting using specific tags (<think> and <answer>)—you’re giving the model a clear blueprint of what’s expected.  \n • This can be the difference between a coherent, logically structured response and output that seems off-target or disorganized.\n\n3. Differences Between llama-cli and llama-server:  \n • It appears that in your setup, llama-cli may have a built-in default or a fallback mechanism that works acceptably even with minimal system messages, while llama-server does not.  \n • This discrepancy suggests that llama-server expects explicit guidance, and if it isn’t provided, its behavior may be unpredictable. Students should be aware that different deployment environments (CLI vs. server) might handle default prompts differently.\n\n4. Prompt Engineering is Critical:  \n • The quality and specificity of the system prompt can have a dramatic impact on the model’s output.  \n • Small errors (like typos) or omissions (leaving it empty) can lead to unintended behavior. Ensuring clarity and completeness in your instructions is a core part of prompt engineering.\n\n5. Best Practices:  \n • Always check and test the system prompt in the environment you expect to deploy (in this case, llama-server).  \n • If you depend on a specific behavior (like a structured output with chain-of-thought markers), make sure that behavior is explicitly encoded in the prompt.\n • Understand that different interfaces or configurations may require different levels of specificity in the system prompt.\n\nIn summary, students should learn that while some interfaces (like llama-cli) might handle underspecified prompts gracefully, others (like llama-server) require explicit, well-crafted instructions. This is a key insight in prompt engineering and system configuration when developing applications that rely on language models.",

          "response": "Students should understand the following points clearly:\n\n1. **Role of the System Message:**  \n   The system message (also called the \"system prompt\") provides the model with context about what its role is, what style of answers it should give, and sometimes how to structure its responses. It is critical for guiding the model's behavior and clarifying expectations. Without clear instructions in the system prompt, the model may produce irrelevant, incoherent, or \"garbage\" output.\n\n2. **Why Simple System Messages May Fail:**  \n   A minimal or vague system prompt such as \"you are helpful assistant\" can often fail to guide the model effectively. Models like Llama require clear, detailed, and structured instructions to produce useful and coherent outputs. When the prompt is too simple or empty, the model may default to providing random or less meaningful responses.\n\n3. **Why Detailed Structured Prompts Work Better:**  \n   The detailed prompt you provided explicitly instructs the model on:\n   - How to structure the response (using `<think>` and `<answer>` tags).\n   - What steps or thought processes it should follow before responding.\n   By clearly delineating the thought process and the expected output format, the model can reliably produce coherent and structured responses.\n\n4. **Difference Between llama-cli and llama-server:**  \n   With a command-line interface (llama-cli), the default system prompt might already be clearly defined or implicitly structured, allowing the model to function correctly without explicitly specifying detailed prompts. However, when using llama-server, the default prompt may be absent or minimal, requiring explicit, detailed instructions provided by the user or developer.\n\n5. **Recommendations for Students:**  \n   Students should:\n   - Always define a clear, explicit, and structured system message when deploying Llama models through llama-server.\n   - Understand the importance of prompt engineering and the impact of clear instructions on model output quality.\n   - Be aware of differences between deployment modes (llama-cli vs. llama-server) and adjust system messages accordingly.\n   - Practice experimenting with different levels of detail and structure in system messages to understand their impacts on performance.\n\nIn short, students should recognize that clearly structured prompts are essential for reliable model performance, particularly when using llama-server, and that the default prompt used in llama-cli might not automatically carry over or function effectively when using the server deployment method.",

Here are a few things your students should be aware of:\n\n1. **Default System Prompt**: The default system prompt can have a significant impact on the output of the language model. A well-designed system prompt can help the model understand the context and provide more coherent and relevant responses. In your case, the default system prompt seems to be working correctly with the `llama-cli` tool, but not with the `llama-server`.\n\n2. **Server-specific Configurations**: The behavior you're observing may be due to the way the `llama-server` is configured or implemented. Different language model servers may have different ways of handling the system message, and it's important to understand the specific requirements and limitations of the server you're using.\n\n3. **Importance of Testing**: It's crucial for your students to thoroughly test the system message and other configurations in the server settings to ensure that the desired behavior is achieved. They should experiment with different system messages and observe the output to understand the impact on the language model's performance.\n\n4. **Documentation and Support**: Your students should consult the documentation provided by the `llama-server` developers to understand the expected behavior and any known limitations or issues with the system message feature. If they encounter any problems, they should seek support from the developers or the community to troubleshoot the issue.\n\n5. **Flexibility and Adaptability**: Your students should be prepared to adapt their approach based on the specific requirements and limitations of the language model server they're using.

Start with minimal prompts\n2. If output is poor, add structure\n3. Test systematic variations\n4. Document what works for each deployment method\n```\n\n### 5. **Production Considerations**\n- Always test system prompts in the actual deployment environment\n- Keep a library of tested prompts for different use cases\n- Consider that \"garbage output\" often means the model lacks sufficient guidance, not that it's broken\n\nThis is a perfect example of why prompt engineering is both an art and a science!",

Let me break down what's happening and then answer your broader question about the evolution of system prompts and their handling.\n\n### Technical Analysis\n\n1. **System Message in llama-server:**\n    - If the system message is very simple (e.g., \"You are a helpful assistant.\") or empty, you get \"garbage output.\"\n    - If the system message is more structured—telling the model to use `<think>` and `<answer>` tags and to reason step by step—the output is much better.\n\n2. **System Message in llama-cli:**\n    - The default system prompt works as expected.\n\n3. **Your Question:**\n    - **\"Can I use default system prompt with llama-cli but not with llama-server?\"**\n      - **Yes,** apparently, with your current setup and the observed behavior, llama-cli is more tolerant or better tuned for simpler system prompts, while llama-server requires a more explicit, structured prompt to function as desired.\n\n---\n\n## Why is this happening?\n\n<think>\nSystem prompts (also called \"system messages\" or \"system instructions\") are a critical part of prompt engineering for LLMs (Large Language Models). They set the context for the conversation and guide the model's behavior.\n\n- **Llama-cli** likely uses a \"default\" system prompt that is well-tuned for general assistant behavior. It may inject additional hidden instructions or formatting that helps the model perform better even if you supply a simple system message.\n- **Llama-server** may use your provided system message verbatim, with less \"behind-the-scenes\" augmentation, so a minimal or empty message gives the model no guidance, resulting in poor output.\n- Models like Llama 2/3 (and others) are sensitive to prompt formatting. Explicit instructions (like using tags for reasoning) help them follow desired steps and produce more structured, higher-quality answers.\n\n**Historically (since the 1990s):**\n- Early chatbot systems (like ELIZA) had hardcoded scripts and no notion of system prompts.\n- The 2010s saw the rise of neural networks, but even then, prompts weren't as important because models were smaller and less flexible.\n- The \"system prompt\" became vital with large transformer-based LLMs (like GPT-3 and beyond, including Llama models), as it allows users to prime the model to behave in specific ways.\n- Now, prompt engineering (including careful crafting of system prompts) is a foundational part of getting good results from LLMs.\n- Different serving infrastructures (cli vs. server) might handle prompts differently—some insert hidden instructions, others rely entirely on what you provide.\n\n</think>\n\n<answer>\nYes, you can use the default system prompt with llama-cli but not with llama-server, based on your testing. This is likely because llama-cli adds its own hidden system prompt or has better defaults, while llama-server relies fully on your provided message. With llama-server, you get better results if you provide a structured, explicit system message.\n\nSince the 1990s, what's changed is that LLMs now require careful prompt engineering, and the system prompt is a critical part of controlling the model's output. Different serving tools may handle these prompts differently, so you may need to adjust your prompt for each tool to get the best results.\n</answer>",

          "response": "Since the 1990s, there have been significant shifts in how AI-driven text systems process input and generate responses. Here are a few key points that explain why a “system prompt” matters today, and why you see different behavior when using llama-cli vs. llama-server:\n\n1. Different architectures for modern models vs. 1990s systems.  \n   • In the 1990s, many conversational or question-answering systems were rule-based or relied on small machine-learning models trained on curated datasets. They lacked the ability to generate free-form text in a flexible way.  \n   • Modern large language models (LLMs) rely on massive neural network architectures and are sensitive to instructions that precede user queries (often called “system prompts” or “system messages”). These prompts can strongly guide output style and content.\n\n2. The role of system messages.  \n   • Today’s LLMs usually have a structured prompt format: there can be a \"system\" role (or message), a \"user\" role, and an \"assistant\" role. The system message is especially important because it sets the overall behavior or domain for the AI assistant.  \n   • If the system prompt in llama-server is empty or too simplistic (“You are a helpful assistant.”, for instance), the model sometimes generates less coherent answers—because it may not have enough instruction context to guide its style, structure, or chain of thought.  \n   • When a system prompt is more detailed—especially if it explicitly tells the model how to reason or how to format its output—it often performs better. You described that using a prompt with tags like <think> and <answer> leads to more coherent results, which suggests the model is relying heavily on that extra structure to organize its reasoning.\n\n3. Differences between llama-cli and llama-server behavior.  \n   • Some command-line tools (like llama-cli) may automatically prepend or inject a more detailed default system prompt if you don’t provide your own, effectively guiding the model even if your prompt is minimal.  \n   • Meanwhile, llama-server might be set up to only use a system prompt if you explicitly fill in its “System Message” field—otherwise, it could pass your text to the model in a different format or with no guiding context, leading to “garbage” responses.  \n   • This discrepancy in defaults can make the same underlying model behave differently across two tools.\n\n4. Why modern LLMs depend on prompt engineering.  \n   • Advanced language models can follow high-level instructions but also rely on subtle cues in the prompt. This is sometimes called “prompt engineering”: carefully crafting instructions that shape the model’s reasoning and output.  \n   • Detailed instructions (“You are a helpful assistant. To answer the user’s question, first think about the reasoning process…”) often dramatically improve output because they tackle ambiguities and direct the model’s style of response.\n\n5. Summary of what changed (in broad strokes):  \n   • From the 1990s to now, there has been a transition from small, specialized rule-based or statistical systems to large-scale, Transformer-based language models capable of open-ended generation.  \n   • The newer models exhibit emergent qualities (like following context instructions) that were not feasible with earlier shallow or rules-based methods. Consequently, well-crafted system messages (whether from llama-cli defaults or your own custom text) become a critical part of getting good answers.\n\nIn short, yes—modern LLMs can behave very differently depending on how the system prompt is applied. The change from the 1990s to now is one of scale, architecture, and the importance of precise instructions. That’s why you’ll see inconsistent results between different tools (llama-cli vs. llama-server) if they each handle the system prompt differently, and why adding a detailed system message can make the model’s output much more coherent and reliable.",

          "response": "Over time the way the “system message” is used to control model behavior (especially for separating hidden reasoning from the final answer) has evolved. In earlier setups (like with llama‑cli) a very simple system prompt such as “you are helpful assistant” was enough to steer the model along the expected path. However, in more recent implementations like llama‑server the handling of the system message has become more “structured.” Here are the key points behind the change:\n\n1. More structured instructions for chain‐of‐thought  \n • With llama‑server the model now distinguishes its internal reasoning from its final public answer. In the new setup the system message can (and by default does) enforce a pattern where the reasoning is wrapped in <think>…</think> tags and the answer in <answer>…</answer> tags.  \n • When you omit these detailed instructions (or leave the field empty) or provide a too‐minimal prompt (“you are helpful assistant”), the model isn’t guided into separating its chain‐of‐thought from the answer. This lack of structure can lead to output that appears “garbage” or otherwise not useful because the intended hidden reasoning and final answer get mixed up or are improperly formatted.\n\n2. Hidden “scratchpad” behavior  \n • The updated system (llama‑server) expects that the internal chain‐of‐thought will be hidden from the user. By giving an explicit system message that instructs the model to “first think about the reasoning process … and then provide the answer” (with explicit <think>/<answer> tags), you tell the model both how to reason and how to communicate its final response. This clearly delineates what should be output.\n • With older behavior (or in simpler setups like llama‑cli), the model might have simply used the system prompt for overall tone without enforcing any strict internal formatting. That is why the minimal prompt could “work” there, even though it might be less robust.\n\n3. Evolved prompting conventions  \n • Over time, as research on chain‑of‑thought and prompt injection improved, developers have found that requiring explicit instructions (such as the tagging convention) leads to more reliable outputs. So, the newer implementations “expect” a more detailed system message.  \n • This shift means that the default behavior (if you leave the system message empty or too simple) no longer produces the intended separation of reasoning and answer, hence the “garbage” output you observed.\n\nIn summary, what has changed is that the model’s prompting interface evolved—from a simple, catch‑all system message (which might have worked in a more “forgiving” way in llama‑cli) to a more explicit, structured system message in llama‑server that clearly distinguishes between internal reasoning and the final answer. If you follow the updated format (enclosing the chain‑of‑thought in <think> and the answer in <answer> tags), you get the correct behavior. Otherwise, the output can become disorganized.\n\nThis evolution reflects both improvements in how we instruct models (by enforcing a clear internal “scratchpad”) and the need to hide the chain‑of‑thought from the end user, ensuring that only a clean, final answer is shown.",

This could be due to the way the language model has been trained and the specific prompting techniques used.\n\n2. **Prompt Engineering**: The system message you provided that works correctly (\"You are a helpful assistant. To answer the user's question, you first think about the reasoning process and then provide the user with the answer. The reasoning process and answer are enclosed within <think> </think> and <answer> </answer> tags, respectively, i.e., <think> reasoning process here </think> <answer> answer here </answer>.\") is an example of effective prompt engineering. This prompt provides clear instructions and structure for the language model to follow, which helps it generate a more coherent and relevant response.\n\n3. **Platform Differences**: The difference in behavior between the llama-cli and llama-server could be due to the way the language model is integrated and used in each platform. The llama-cli may have different default prompt handling or other configurations that allow it to handle the default system message more effectively.\n\n4. **Language Model Sensitivity**: Language models can be sensitive to the exact wording and structure of the prompts provided. Small changes in the prompt can sometimes result in significant differences in the generated output. This is a known challenge in prompt engineering and can require careful experimentation to find the right prompts for a particular language model.\n\nTo better understand the underlying reasons for the observed behavior, you could try the following:\n\n1. **Experiment with Different Prompts**: Try different variations of the system message, including different levels of detail and structure, to see how the language model responds.\n\n2. **Investigate Platform Differences**: Examine the documentation or source code (if available) of the llama-cli and llama-server to understand if there are any differences in the way they handle system messages or prompts.\n\n3. **Check Language Model Capabilities**: Research the specific language model being used (e.g., its training data, architecture, and capabilities) to better understand its strengths and limitations in handling different types of prompts.\n\n4. **Seek Community Feedback**: Engage with the community of developers and researchers working with language models to see if they have encountered similar issues and can provide insights or potential solutions.\n\nBy exploring these aspects, you may be able to gain a better understanding of the evolution of language model prompt handling and the factors that contribute to the observed differences in behavior between the llama-cli and llama-server.",

Some frontends (like llama-cli) may include a built-in system prompt that guides the model, even if you don't provide one, while others (like llama-server) may leave it empty unless you specify something.\n\n2. **llama-cli Behavior:**  \n   llama-cli may have a hardcoded default system message, so even if you don't set one, it works as expected.\n\n3. **llama-server Behavior:**  \n   llama-server may only use the system message you provide in the settings, and if that’s empty or vague (\"you are helpful assistant\"), there’s no guidance for the model, leading to poor output.\n\n4. **Detailed Prompts:**  \n   By specifying exactly how the assistant should respond (with tags, reasoning, etc.), you give the model a strong structure to follow, which improves output.\n\n**Answer:**\n\nYou do not need to \"evolve\" or \"change\" the server, but you should give llama-server a detailed system message to match what works in llama-cli. If you want llama-server to behave like llama-cli, set your system message to the detailed template (with <think> and <answer> instructions).\n\n**What to do:**\n\n- In llama-server’s settings, always set the system message to something detailed, e.g.:\n\n  ```\n  You are a helpful assistant. To answer the user's question, you first think about the reasoning process and then provide the user with the answer. The reasoning process and answer are enclosed within <think> </think> and <answer> </answer> tags, respectively, i.e., <think> reasoning process here </think> <answer> answer here </answer>.\n  ```\n\n- If you want the default system prompt to be used automatically in llama-server (like in llama-cli), you could check if llama-server allows you to specify a default system prompt in its config or source code, or you may need to set this manually.\n\n**Summary Table:**\n\n| System Message                 | llama-cli | llama-server |\n|-------------------------------|:---------:|:------------:|\n| Empty                         |   Works   |    Broken    |\n| \"you are helpful assistant\"   |   Works   |    Broken    |\n| Detailed instructions         |   Works   |    Works     |\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nllama-server relies on the system message you provide. Use a detailed prompt for best results. You do not need to change the server itself, just provide a better system message.\n\nIf you want to streamline this, consider setting the detailed prompt as the default in your llama-server configuration or startup script.",

          "response": "It sounds like llama-cli and llama-server differ in how they handle—or ignore—the “system message,” which is why you see different results. In some setups, the system message has to be passed in a specific format or with certain prefix tokens to be recognized properly, and that can vary depending on which interface (cli vs. server) you are using.\n\nHere are a few steps you can try:\n\n1. Check how llama-server constructs its prompt:\n   • Some llama-server implementations either ignore the system message or treat it differently unless it follows a specific format.  \n   • See if there is a configuration parameter or template in llama-server that you need to adjust so that the system prompt is actually injected into the conversation.\n\n2. Match the exact format used by llama-cli:\n   • If llama-cli is injecting “You are a helpful assistant…” with special tokens or prefix text, try mirroring that exact approach in llama-server.  \n   • Sometimes you must include a role designator like <|SYSTEM|> or “### System:” or similar tokens. Confirm whether llama-cli is automatically adding those tokens.\n\n3. Provide a fuller system instruction as you did with the working example:\n   • Shorter prompts like “You are a helpful assistant” might not be enough for llama-server to parse correctly. Use the more verbose system message that includes how to respond, your role, and the structure of the answer (e.g., using <think> and <answer>), if that is what yields correct output.\n\n4. Check for differences in version or config:\n   • Sometimes different versions of the model or the server have changed how they interpret the “system” prompt. Make sure your llama-cli and llama-server setups both point to the same version of the model and share similar settings where possible.\n\n5. Inspect logs or console output:\n   • If available, look at how llama-server displays or logs the incoming prompt. You can confirm whether your system message is genuinely passed to the model as you intend.\n\nUltimately, because llama-cli and llama-server may not be completely interchangeable in how they handle the system message, you sometimes need to adapt or replicate the prompt format from the CLI to the server environment. Adjusting the wording, adding the same explicit structure you used in the working example, or confirming whether special tokens are required will often fix “garbage output” and let you use a default system prompt in llama-server as well.",

          "response": "It sounds like you’ve discovered that the minimal system prompt (\"you are helpful assisant\") isn’t enough to guide the model in the server implementation, even though it works acceptably in the CLI version. In contrast, when you give a more detailed, structured prompt (one that explicitly tells the model to “think” and then provide an answer within specific tags), the llama-server produces output as expected.\n\nWhy might this be happening?\n\n1. Detailed guidance versus minimal instruction:\n • In the llama-server setup the system prompt is often used to set the overall behavior of the model for an entire session or conversation. When the prompt is very brief (“you are helpful assisant”), it might not activate enough internal guidance for the server’s operation.  \n • A more elaborate system prompt (including explicit instructions for the reasoning process and formatting) provides the model with a clear, unambiguous expectation about its output. This extra structure forces the model to operate under a carefully defined “chain-of-thought” protocol, reducing ambiguity in its generation.\n\n2. Implementation differences between llama-cli and llama-server:\n • It’s possible that the CLI version applies a different default for missing instructions or processes the system message differently from the server version. Llama-server might be expecting a full, well-defined instruction set and when it doesn’t see one, the output can devolve into what you describe as “garbage.”\n • The server might have an internal mechanism that requires stronger guiding signals since it often interacts with more variable inputs or external API calls. Without a sufficiently strong prompt, the default behavior might not align with your intended use.\n\n3. Evolve or change?\n • In your situation you have two options. You can either try to evolve the default system prompt used in llama-server by incorporating a more detailed instruction (like the one that uses the <think> and <answer> tags) or you could modify the server’s internal handling to better accept shorter default instructions.\n • Practically speaking, it’s easier (and more robust) to provide a detailed system prompt rather than relying on minimal guidance. The detailed prompt gives you control over the model’s behavior and output structure, which seems to resolve the “garbage” output issue.\n\nIn summary, while llama-cli handles a default, minimal system prompt without much trouble, the llama-server benefits from an evolved (i.e., more detailed and structured) system prompt. It isn’t so much a bug as it is a difference in how the two interfaces interpret and prioritize system instructions. The best approach in your case is to change (or “evolve”) your system prompt on the server to include the explicit reasoning and formatting instructions that yield the correct results.",

Let me explain what's happening and how you can solve it:\n\n### Why this happens:\nLLaMA models (and similar open-source LLMs) typically rely heavily on clear instruction prompts to produce coherent and structured outputs. A vague or short system prompt like \"you are helpful assistant\" or leaving the system prompt empty typically confuses the model or causes it to produce nonsensical or unstructured output.\n\nWhen you use detailed instructions, including explicit tags (such as `<think>` and `<answer>`), the model is guided clearly toward structured reasoning and structured output. Thus, the model knows exactly what you expect, resulting in coherent, useful responses.\n\n### Why it works with llama-cli but not llama-server:\n- **llama-cli** typically includes a default template or structured prompt internally, even if you don't explicitly set a system message. It automatically wraps user queries within clear instructions or structured prompts, ensuring the model understands clearly what it should do.\n- **llama-server** (or llama.cpp server) often requires explicit and detailed prompt instructions from the user side, as it may not provide default structured instructions by default. Without those explicit instructions, it provides ambiguous prompts to the model, leading to unclear or nonsensical responses.\n\n### How to fix this:\nYou should explicitly define your ideal structured \"system message\" prompt, as you have already discovered. For example, the prompt you mentioned works well:\n\n```\nYou are a helpful assistant. To answer the user's question, you first think about the reasoning process and then provide the user with the answer. The reasoning process and answer are enclosed within <think> </think> and <answer> </answer> tags, respectively, i.e., <think> reasoning process here </think> <answer> answer here </answer>.\n```\n\n### Recommendations to evolve or change:\n- **Standardize your prompt**: Always use a detailed and structured prompt like the one above. This ensures consistent performance and reliability.\n- **Prompt templates**: Consider creating standard prompt templates to reuse easily in llama-server.\n- **Server-side defaults**: If you're running your own llama-server instance, consider modifying the server code or request handling logic to automatically provide a structured default prompt if none is explicitly provided by the user.\n\n### Conclusion:\nYour observation is accurate and common. The issue isn't really a bug, but rather a reflection of how sensitive LLaMA-based models are to clear, structured prompts. The simplest fix is to explicitly define a structured system prompt as you've found effective.",

I should address the apparent inconsistency and explain what might be happening.\n</think>\n\n<answer>\nIt sounds like you're encountering an implementation difference between llama-cli and llama-server in how they handle system messages.\n\nWhat's likely happening is that llama-server might require more explicit formatting instructions in the system message to properly structure the output, whereas llama-cli might have some default formatting or handling built in.\n\nThis could be due to:\n\n1. Different default configurations between the CLI and server implementations\n2. The server implementation possibly requiring more explicit instruction to maintain consistent output formatting\n3. The model possibly responding differently to the context structure created by the server vs. CLI\n\nFor now, it seems the solution is to use the more detailed system message with the formatting instructions when working with llama-server. You might want to:\n\n- Report this as an issue to the llama.cpp GitHub repository\n- Create a preset configuration for your server with the working system message\n- Check if there are any server configuration parameters that might affect how system messages are processed\n\nThis inconsistency will likely be addressed in future updates as the tooling matures, but for now, using the more explicit system message that works is your best option.\n</answer>",

Here are the likely causes and solutions:\n\n**Why this happens:**\n- llama-server and llama-cli may use different chat templates or prompt formatting\n- The server might not properly apply the chat template to system messages\n- Some models require more structured/explicit system prompts when used via API\n\n**Solutions to try:**\n\n1. **Check chat template**: Ensure your model has a proper chat template defined, or specify one explicitly:\n   ```bash\n   llama-server --chat-template \"your-template\" ...\n   ```\n\n2. **Use structured system messages**: As you discovered, more explicit formatting works better with the server:\n   ```\n   You are a helpful assistant. Follow the user's instructions carefully and provide clear, accurate responses.\n   ```\n\n3. **Try different system message formats**:\n   - Add explicit role definition\n   - Include response format instructions\n   - Use the working template as a base and modify it\n\n4. **Server-specific parameters**: Check if you need to adjust:\n   - `--ctx-size`\n   - `--temp` \n   - `--repeat-penalty`\n\n5. **Alternative**: Use the working structured prompt as your base template and customize the instructions within the `<think>` and `<answer>` tags framework.\n\nThe structured prompt works because it gives the model clear expectations about output format, which the server implementation seems to require more explicitly than the CLI version.\n</answer>",

The Importance of Detailed Prompt Engineering:\n • The significance of providing a sufficiently detailed directive in the system message, particularly when aiming for outputs that follow structural conventions (in this case, the <think> reasoning and <answer> answer separation).\n • How explicit instructions promote consistent output and reduce “garbage” results.\n • The demonstration that even small changes in instructions (from “you are helpful assistant” to a detailed guideline) lead to substantial differences in outcome quality.\n\n4.

Aligning Model Behavior with Application Requirements:\n • How to bridge the gap between the raw language model behavior and the needs of an application (e.g., providing a reasoning process with a clear answer).\n • Learning from the observed discrepancies to improve model setup and interaction design.\n • Discussion on fallback behaviors when the system message is empty or minimal, and how to design safety nets or assert higher-level instructions.\n\n6.

The server implementation appears to require more explicit instruction formatting than the CLI version.\n\n**Prof. Rodriguez:** This is fascinating. The detailed system message that worked included explicit output formatting instructions with tags. Simple messages like \"you are helpful assistant\" don't provide enough structure for the server context, leading to poor outputs.\n\n**Sarah Kim:** What we're seeing is that the llama-cli likely has additional wrapper code that structures the interaction properly, while the server exposes the raw model behavior without those guardrails.\n\n**Dr. Chen:** Exactly. The key learning here is that the server implementation requires explicit formatting instructions in the system message to produce coherent responses, while the CLI might add these instructions behind the scenes.\n\n## Key Learning Objectives\n\n1. **Model Context Sensitivity:** LLMs require appropriate context setting through system messages, and this requirement may differ across deployment methods.\n\n2. **Explicit Formatting Requirements:** The server implementation needs explicit output formatting instructions (like the tags in your working example) to structure responses properly.\n\n3. **Implementation Differences:** CLI tools often include additional processing that server implementations leave to the developer.\n\n4. **Prompt Engineering Importance:** This demonstrates why careful prompt engineering is critical for production deployments.\n\n5. **Debugging Approach:** When deploying LLMs, testing different system messages systematically helps identify optimal configuration.\n\n**Sarah Kim:** For practical implementation, I'd recommend documenting the working system message as your baseline and using that as a starting point for any modifications needed for specific use cases.",

Document the working system prompt as a template\n2. Test variations to understand minimum viable prompt complexity\n3. Investigate server configuration options for default behaviors\n4. Consider implementing prompt validation in your deployment pipeline\n\nThis discovery highlights why production AI deployments require careful attention to environment-specific configuration details.",

          "response": "Great observation! Let’s break down what’s happening here, theoretically, and why you’re seeing these differences between **llama-cli** and **llama-server** with regards to the system prompt / system message.\n\n## 1. What does the \"system message\" do?\nThe **system message** (or system prompt) is an instruction given to the language model before any user input. It typically defines the model’s role, behavior, and sometimes the expected output format. Examples:\n\n- \"You are a helpful assistant.\" (vague, general behavior guidance)\n- \"You are a helpful assistant. To answer the user's question, you first think about the reasoning process and then provide the user with the answer. The reasoning process and answer are enclosed within <think> </think> and <answer> </answer> tags, respectively, i.e., <think> reasoning process here </think> <answer> answer here </answer>.\" (very explicit, including output formatting)\n\n## 2. Why does explicit formatting help?\nLanguage models like Llama (and others) are **pattern-matching engines**. If you give a very generic instruction (\"You are a helpful assistant.\") they’ll try to be helpful, but may not adhere to any particular format or process. If you give **explicit, clear instructions**—especially about structure—they’re much more likely to follow them.\n\n## 3. Why does the empty system message or vague prompt result in garbage?\nWhen the system prompt is **empty or too vague**, the model doesn’t have enough context or instruction to generate a structured or high-quality answer, especially if the inference backend expects a certain format for further processing or parsing.\n\n## 4. Why does this work with llama-cli but not llama-server?\nThis is where implementation differences come into play:\n\n- **llama-cli**: May have its own default prompt engineering, or may inject its own \"system\" context even if you leave the system message empty.\n- **llama-server**: May rely **entirely** on what you provide in the \"System Message\" field. If empty or too vague, it doesn’t know how to initialize the conversation, and the output is unstructured or low-quality (\"garbage\").\n\nAdditionally, **llama-server** could expect the model to output responses in a certain format (e.g., for post-processing, UI rendering, or API usage). If the prompt doesn’t instruct the model to use that format, downstream processes might break or produce \"garbage\" output.\n\n## 5. In principle: can you use the default prompt with llama-cli but not llama-server?\n**In principle, yes.** If llama-cli and llama-server handle prompt assembly differently, you may find that:\n\n- **llama-cli** works with the default or empty system prompt because it adds its own context.\n- **llama-server** requires you to be explicit in the system message, especially if downstream processing expects a certain output format.\n\n## 6. Summary Table\n\n| System Message                        | llama-cli | llama-server |\n|----------------------------------------|-----------|--------------|\n| Empty                                 | Works?    | Garbage      |\n| \"You are a helpful assistant.\"         | Works?    | Garbage      |\n| Explicit, formatted instructions       | Works     | Works        |\n\n(**Works?**: depends on internal prompt handling—sometimes yes, sometimes not.)\n\n## 7. What should you do?\nIf you want consistent, high-quality, and structured output—**always use a specific, explicit system message** that details both the assistant’s behavior and the output format you want, especially with llama-server.\n\n---\n\n**In summary:**  \nllama-server likely does not inject any default prompt or formatting, so you must be explicit in your system message. llama-cli may \"help\" more behind the scenes. For best results, always use clear, detailed system messages, especially when using llama-server.\n\nIf you have further questions about prompt formatting or want a template system message, let me know!",

          "response": "In broad terms, language models typically process all supplied text—whether identified as “system,” “user,” or “assistant”—as part of a single input sequence. The “system message” portion is a way to provide high-level instructions or context about how the model should behave. Here is a conceptual overview of why and how it can make a difference:\n\n1. Position in Input Matters.  \n   • In many implementations, the system message is placed at the beginning of the entire prompt text (before user messages).  \n   • Because the model reads from start to finish, putting a carefully worded prompt at the beginning often influences the text-generation process more strongly.  \n\n2. Model “Instructions” vs. Content Generation.  \n   • The system message usually establishes “rules” and guidelines—e.g., “You are a helpful assistant that reasons step by step.”  \n   • If it is missing or minimal (like simply “you are a helpful assistant”), the model may not receive enough structure or might revert to default behavior that produces unexpected or “garbage” text.  \n   • If the system message is more elaborate—e.g., telling the model exactly how to format the output—then the model is much more likely to produce the desired style or format (for instance, placing the reasoning in <think> tags and the final answer in <answer> tags).  \n\n3. Differences Between Tools (llama-cli vs. llama-server).  \n   • Although they rely on the same underlying language model, llama-cli and llama-server might process prompts differently or place them differently in the model’s prompt sequence.  \n   • If llama-cli consistently places your system message at the start of the prompt (where it is most influential), it’s more likely to produce the text you expect.  \n   • If llama-server is overriding or ignoring the system message—or if it places it in a location in the conversation that the model pays less attention to—that can result in less reliable or “garbage” output.  \n\n4. Why a More Detailed System Message Works.  \n   • A model will generally adapt better to specific directives, such as: “Provide a step-by-step chain of thought inside <think>…</think> and the final answer in <answer>…</answer> tags.”  \n   • This is because the prompt explicitly encodes both the structure of the process (chain of thought) and the structure of the final reply (the answer), so the model attempts to comply with that format.  \n\n5. Theoretical Underpinnings.  \n   • Fundamentally, large language models generate text by predicting the next token that is most probable given the current input context.  \n   • A detailed system message shifts that probability distribution to favor a more structured, coherent style of reasoning and answering.  \n   • Without sufficient guidance, the model’s next-token predictions can wander, leading to nonsensical or tangential responses.  \n\nSo, in principle, the key factor is where and how the system message is placed in the conversation’s prompt, and how precisely that message is worded. If llama-cli and llama-server handle the system prompt differently, then you may see different behaviors unless you replicate the same prompt arrangement (including the system message) in both.",

In your observations, merely saying “you are helpful assisant” (or leaving the field empty) doesn’t provide the model with enough guidance on how to structure its output. With llama‑server, if the system message is empty or too minimal it won’t “prime” the model properly, leading to output that appears unpredictable or “garbage.” By contrast, when you supply a longer, more detailed message—one that includes both a request for a reasoning process and explicit formatting (using the <think> and <answer> tags)—you give the model clear instructions about how to organize its output. This extra guidance pushes the model toward producing the desired structured response.\n\nSo in principle you can say that with llama‑cli the default system prompt (or internal default behavior) may be more forgiving, but with llama‑server you must supply a detailed enough system message to “steer” the output in the expected manner. It may be that the two interfaces are configured differently: one might have built‑in defaults or different pre‑processing than the other. In your experiment, only the explicit and detailed system message appears to be sufficient to generate the expected results.\n\nThus, yes—in principle you can use a default system prompt with llama‑cli that works for your needs, but with llama‑server you’ll need to supply a sufficiently detailed system prompt (like the one with the reasoning process and formatted tags) to get the intended behavior.",

When using a simple system message (\"you are helpful assistant\") in llama-server, the output is garbage\n2. When leaving the system message empty, the output is garbage\n3. When using a detailed, structured prompt with specific output formatting instructions, it works correctly\n\n## Theoretical Explanation\n\nThis behavior likely stems from differences in how system messages are processed and integrated into the context window between the CLI and server implementations:\n\n1. **Token Processing**: The server might be handling system message tokens differently than the CLI, possibly not properly separating them from user input or not giving them appropriate weight/priority.\n\n2. **Format Recognition**: The model appears to need explicit structure when running in server mode. The working system message provides clear formatting instructions with tags (`<think>` and `<answer>`), giving the model a structured framework to follow.\n\n3. **Context Window Management**: The server implementation might have different default behaviors for managing how system messages are positioned relative to user queries in the context window.\n\n4. **Default Behaviors**: It's possible that llama-cli has some additional default system message handling that isn't present in llama-server.\n\n## Theoretical Solution\n\nTo make the server work properly, you need to:\n\n1. Use explicit formatting instructions in your system message\n2. Provide clear role definition for the model\n3. Include output structure guidelines (like the tags you mentioned)\n\nThis suggests that llama-server might be implementing a more \"raw\" interface to the model, requiring more explicit instructions, while llama-cli might have additional wrappers that help format the interaction in a way the model better understands.\n\nThe detailed prompt works because it gives the model specific guidance on how to structure its thinking and response, which compensates for whatever processing differences exist in the server implementation.",

You might need to set:\n   ```\n   --chat-template \"template-name\"\n   ```\n\n2. **Use Model-Specific System Prompts**: Try system prompts that match the model's training format exactly.\n\n3. **Server Configuration**: Check if there are additional server flags like:\n   - `--no-chat-template`\n   - `--in-prefix`/`--in-suffix`\n   - Custom prompt formatting options\n\n4. **Debug Mode**: Run the server with verbose logging to see exactly how prompts are being formatted.\n\nThe fact that the detailed prompt works suggests the server needs more explicit instructions to properly format the conversation for your specific model.",

          "response": "You've made an important observation about how system prompts influence model behavior when using different interfaces (llama-cli vs llama-server) for Llama-based models. Let's clarify the situation:\n\n### 1. **Default System Prompt (llama-cli)**\n- **llama-cli** typically uses a well-crafted default system prompt (if unspecified), which helps guide the model's responses towards helpfulness, coherence, and relevance.\n- This default prompt is usually optimized for chat or assistant-like behavior.\n\n### 2. **llama-server System Message**\n- **llama-server** allows you to set a \"System Message\" field, which acts as the initial instruction to the model.\n- **If the field is left empty or given a generic/short prompt** (e.g., \"you are helpful assistant\"), the model may not reliably understand context or provide structured responses.\n- **If you provide a detailed instruction** (like your tag-structured prompt), the model gets clear guidance on how to format its reasoning and answers. This is why it works better.\n\n### 3. **Why the Difference?**\n- The model is very sensitive to prompt engineering. A vague or minimal system prompt gives little context, so the model's outputs can become erratic or \"garbage.\"\n- A detailed, explicit system prompt (especially instructing the model on *how* to reason and respond) gives it a clear \"role\" and expected format.\n- **llama-cli** may automatically insert a good default prompt when none is provided, while **llama-server** expects you to provide one (or leaves it blank otherwise).\n\n### 4. **Summary Table**\n\n| Interface      | System Message      | Output Quality        | Notes                   |\n|----------------|---------------------|-----------------------|-------------------------|\n| llama-cli      | Default/none        | Good                  | Uses internal defaults  |\n| llama-server   | Empty/short         | Poor/Erratic (\"garbage\") | Needs explicit guidance |\n| llama-server   | Detailed instruction| Good                  | Works as expected       |\n\n### 5. **Best Practice**\n- **With llama-server, always set a clear, explicit system message** that defines the assistant's role and expected answer format.\n- You may want to copy the default system prompt from llama-cli (if possible) or use your own detailed version, as you've done with the `<think>` and `<answer>` tags.\n\n### 6. **Can you use default system prompt with llama-server?**\n- **Not automatically.** Unless llama-server is configured to use the same default prompt as llama-cli, you'll need to manually set it in the server's system message field.\n\n---\n\n**In summary:**  \nllama-cli provides a good default system prompt, whereas llama-server needs you to supply a detailed system message for good results. For consistent, high-quality outputs, always use a clear, instructive system message with llama-server.\n\nIf you want, you can extract the default prompt from llama-cli's source/configuration and reuse it in your llama-server setup!\n\nLet me know if you want help with example prompts or how to extract the default one from llama-cli.",

In many LLM interfaces, if the system instruction is left empty—or replaced with very short text—some models will not receive sufficient guidance and may generate incoherent or “garbage” output. When a detailed directive (like including <think> and <answer> tags) is provided in the system prompt, that extra structure often produces more coherent results.\n\nIf you want llama-server to use the same kind of prompt you have tested successfully with llama-cli, you generally need to replicate that same prompt text in the “System Message” field in llama-server. In other words, for best results:\n\n• Make sure the “System Message” field is not left blank.  \n• Enter a clear system instruction—like the one including <think> and <answer> tags—so that the model gets the same guiding text it does when run via llama-cli.  \n\nIn some llama-server setups, there can also be a difference in how the system prompt is appended to the conversation or how it’s processed if the field is empty. Ensuring you have the desired system prompt explicitly defined before your conversation starts is generally the safest approach. \n\nSo, yes, you can typically use the same system prompt in llama-server that you do in llama-cli, but you must explicitly set it (rather than relying on an empty field or very short text).",

          "response": "It turns out that the “magic” comes from the prompt’s content rather than from the tool (llama-cli versus llama-server) per se. The examples you describe suggest that when you include the detailed instructions (with the <think> and <answer> tag directives) in the system message, the model “knows” how you want its output formatted and processes the reasoning first and then produces the answer. In contrast, a minimal system message (or leaving it empty) doesn’t set up that structure, so the output becomes “garbage” (i.e. not formatted or otherwise aligned with your expectations).\n\nTo be more specific:\n\n• When you use only “you are helpful assistant” as your system message, it tells the model nothing about the expected structure, reasoning process, or any special output markers. As a result, the model produces output that doesn’t meet your needs.\n\n• When you leave the system message empty, there’s also no guidance on the formatting or reasoning process, and thus the outputs remain similarly unstructured.\n\n• Only when you specify a system message that includes explicit instructions like “first think about the reasoning process and then provide the user with the answer. The reasoning process and answer are enclosed within <think>...</think> and <answer>...</answer> tags…” does the model follow that chain-of-thought approach and deliver the structured output.\n\nSo, can you use the default system prompt with llama-cli but not with llama-server? Essentially, this isn’t a limitation of llama-server itself but rather how the configuration in the “system message” field interacts with the server’s prompt template. Depending on your tool’s implementation, the default system prompt used by llama-cli may already be “decorated” or designed to invoke the behavior you want without you needing to add the extra instructions. Conversely, llama-server may be more “bare‐bones”—if you leave the system message empty or too minimal, it won’t impose the chain-of-thought structure.\n\nThe key takeaway is that if you want the detailed reasoning and structured answer (with <think> and <answer> markers) regardless of whether you’re using llama-cli or llama-server, you need to include those explicit instructions in the system message. It’s not so much that one tool supports a default prompt and the other doesn’t, but rather that the default settings (or the lack of explicit formatting instructions) yield undesired output in the llama-server configuration.\n\nFor your comparative case study analysis you might consider that:\n\n1. Some setups (like your llama-cli default) might have hard-coded/inherited “default” system messages that incorporate formatting instructions you need.\n2. Other setups (like your llama-server) rely entirely on the text in the system message field, so if you don’t give it detailed instructions, it won’t produce the output you expect.\n3. Consistency of expected output across implementations can be achieved by ensuring the system message is explicit enough about the desired formatting and reasoning process.\n\nIn summary, it’s not that you “can’t” use a default prompt with llama-server; rather, the default (or empty) prompt isn’t triggering the structured output you need in that context. The solution is to include the detailed chain-of-thought instructions explicitly when using llama-server.",

What factors should I track over time for a longitudinal study of this behavior?\n\n---\n\nHere's a structured way to approach your longitudinal study:\n\n## 1. **Prompt Handling Differences**\n   - **llama-cli** vs. **llama-server**: Track/compare how each system handles system messages and user prompts.  \n     - Does each pass the system message in the same way to the underlying model?\n     - Is there preprocessing or additional context (e.g., formatting, truncation, appending instructions) in either tool?\n\n## 2. **Model Version/Settings**\n   - Record the exact model version, checkpoint, and parameters (e.g., temperature, top_p, max_tokens) used in both environments.\n   - Note any differences in the configuration files or environment variables.\n\n## 3. **System Message Content**\n   - Track the specific system message used in each test (empty, default, custom with tags, etc.).\n   - Record the outputs for each variant and the context in which each was tested.\n\n## 4. **Output Quality**\n   - Define and track metrics for \"garbage\" vs. \"good\" output (e.g., coherence, relevance, formatting).\n   - Optionally, use automated evaluation tools or human raters for output quality scoring.\n\n## 5. **Prompt Construction & API Differences**\n   - Investigate if llama-server and llama-cli construct prompts for the model differently (e.g., how they wrap user input and system message).\n   - Track any escape characters, tokenization differences, or prompt templates used.\n\n## 6. **System/Environment Differences**\n   - Note OS, hardware, software versions, and any relevant dependencies in both setups.\n\n## 7. **Change Log**\n   - If you update or change any component (model, llama-server version, llama-cli version, configuration), log it with date/time.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary Table Example**\n\n| Date       | Tool         | Model Name | Model Settings | System Message                            | Output Example | Quality Score | Notes                |\n|------------|--------------|------------|---------------|-------------------------------------------|---------------|--------------|----------------------|\n| 2024-06-11 | llama-cli    | Llama-3    | temp=0.7      | You are a helpful assistant.              | [good output] | 4/5          |                      |\n| 2024-06-11 | llama-server | Llama-3    | temp=0.7      | You are a helpful assistant.              | [garbage]     | 1/5          |                      |\n| 2024-06-11 | llama-server | Llama-3    | temp=0.7      | <think>...<answer>...</answer>            | [good output] | 5/5          |                      |\n\n---\n\n## **To Answer Your Core Question**\n\n**Yes, you are observing that the default system prompt works in llama-cli but not in llama-server.**  \nThis likely points to differences in prompt construction, system message handling, or input pre/post-processing between the two tools.\n\n### **Key Factors to Track Over Time:**\n- System message content & format\n- Output quality (with examples)\n- Tool and version used (llama-cli vs. llama-server)\n- Model version and settings\n- Any configuration or environment changes\n- How each tool wraps and sends prompts to the model\n\n---\n\n**Tip:** If you want to dig deeper, examine the source code or logs of both llama-cli and llama-server to see exactly how the system message and user prompt are combined and sent to the model.\n\nIf you share output examples or more specifics, I can help you pinpoint the technical cause!",

Prompt-Related Variables\n   • Type of system prompt: The exact text used in the system message (e.g., “You are helpful assistant,” versus a structured prompt with tags).\n   • Presence or absence of a system prompt: Some runs might have a blank system prompt, some might have a simple default, others might have a more detailed or structured prompt.\n   • Prompt length: Whether small changes in length or specificity of the system message cause different responses.\n\n2. Model Performance Indicators\n   • Response quality: A rubric or any subjective rating (helpfulness, correctness, coherence) or a user satisfaction score.\n   • Response consistency: How consistently the model addresses the question across repeated prompts.\n   • Occurrence of “garbage” or errors: When the output is nonsensical or off-topic, keep track of frequency and severity.\n\n3. Technical and Environment Factors\n   • Differences between llama-cli and llama-server:\n     – Software versions (e.g., different library versions, container images, or compiled binaries).\n     – Configuration details (e.g., max tokens, temperature, top-p, instruction-truncation, etc.).\n   • Resource usage:\n     – CPU/GPU load\n     – Memory footprint\n     – Latency (response time)\n   • Server logs and error messages:\n     – Check for warnings, timeouts, or crashed sessions.\n   • Network environment:\n     – Connection stability or any latency spikes in client–server communication.\n\n4. Changes in Usage Patterns\n   • Frequency of queries: Are you calling the model with the same or varying frequencies over time?\n   • Complexity of queries: Are you consistently testing with the same difficulty level of questions or a mix of simple and complex ones?\n   • Types of questions: Are they open-ended, factual, procedural, etc.?\n\n5. Model Fine-Tuning or Updates\n   • If the model is updated or fine-tuned between tests, track how the system prompt responses change.\n   • Keep versioned records of changes so you can link any improvements or degradations to a particular update.\n\n6. User Impression and Feedback\n   • If other users are testing or providing feedback, record their subjective impressions, suggestions, or ratings.\n   • Track how user behavior changes as the model improves or regresses (e.g., do users stop asking certain types of questions if they receive poor answers?).\n\n7. Experimental Design Details\n   • If you are A/B testing prompts (for example, default prompt vs. structured prompt), keep a controlled environment so you can fairly compare outcomes.\n   • Maintain consistent intervals for measuring results (e.g., daily or weekly snapshots).\n   • Keep clear documentation of any changes made to prompts, software, or configurations across different time periods.\n\nBy collecting and analyzing these data points over time, you can better understand why llama-cli might behave differently from llama-server and how different system prompts directly influence output quality.",

Model version and configuration:\n  • Note which model version is being used in each setting along with any configuration differences.  \n  • Track any updates to the underlying model or its inference libraries.\n\n2. Prompt handling and injection:\n  • Record the exact content of the system prompt and how it’s being prepended to or integrated with the user prompt.  \n  • Notice if there’s any additional preprocessing or modifications in llama-server compared to llama-cli (for instance, extra tokens, formatting, or hidden instructions).\n\n3. Decoding parameters:\n  • Monitor temperature, top-p (nucleus sampling), beam width, and any other decoding options.  \n  • Check if the default values for these are different between the CLI and the server environment or have changed over time.\n\n4. Token management and context window:\n  • Over time, track how tokens are managed (e.g., maximum context length, truncation, or padding behavior).  \n  • Changes in the handling of the system prompt or token allocations might affect output quality.\n\n5. Environment-specific settings:\n  • Look for differences in server settings (like caching strategies, request timeouts, logging verbosity, or any “safety” filters that may alter output).  \n  • Investigate if the server environment adds invisible prompts or meta instructions that might interfere with the intended system prompt.\n\n6. Logging and error reporting:\n  • Keep detailed logs of both the raw input (including system and user prompts) and the resulting output.  \n  • Track any warnings or errors that might hint at misinterpretations of the instructions.\n\n7. Consistency of formatting expectations:\n  • Since a carefully crafted system prompt that specifies tags (<think> … </think> and <answer> … </answer>) produces “good” outputs, monitor if and when formatting guidelines are modified either in the prompt or by the inference pipeline.\n  • Over time, check that the formatting instructions are truly being inserted and respected across environments.\n\nBy keeping track of these factors, you can identify when discrepancies or regressions occur and then correlate those with changes in the server settings, model updates, or decoding parameter tweaks.

          "response": "There are a few factors you should consider when tracking the performance of your language model over time in a longitudinal study, especially when using different deployment methods (llama-cli vs. llama-server):\n\n1. **Prompt Engineering**: The prompt you provide to the language model can have a significant impact on the output quality. In your case, the \"system message\" appears to be a crucial part of the prompt. You've identified that a specific prompt works correctly with llama-cli but not with llama-server. This suggests that the language model may be sensitive to subtle changes in the prompt, and you should carefully monitor the impact of different prompts on the output.\n\n2. **Model Configuration**: Ensure that the language model configurations are consistent between the llama-cli and llama-server deployments. This includes factors like the model size, architecture, and any fine-tuning or additional training that has been performed. Differences in these configurations could lead to divergent behaviors.\n\n3. **Execution Environment**: The execution environment, such as the hardware, operating system, and any other software dependencies, can also affect the model's performance. Make sure that the llama-cli and llama-server deployments are running in comparable environments.\n\n4. **Logging and Monitoring**: Implement robust logging and monitoring mechanisms to track the model's behavior over time. This could include capturing the input prompts, the model's outputs, and any other relevant metrics or logs that could help you identify the root cause of the observed differences.\n\n5. **Reproducibility**: Ensure that your experiments are reproducible by thoroughly documenting the setup, configurations, and any changes made over time. This will help you track the evolution of the system and identify the factors that contribute to the observed changes in performance.\n\n6. **Evaluation Metrics**: Establish a set of evaluation metrics that are appropriate for your use case and longitudinal study. This could include measures of output quality, coherence, relevance, or any other domain-specific metrics that are relevant to your application.\n\n7. **Comparison and Analysis**: Regularly compare the performance of the llama-cli and llama-server deployments using the established evaluation metrics. Analyze any differences in performance and investigate the underlying causes, such as prompt engineering, model configurations, or environmental factors.\n\nBy tracking these factors over time, you can gain a better understanding of the stability and consistency of your language model's performance across different deployment methods. This will help you identify any issues or opportunities for improvement, and ultimately ensure the reliability and robustness of your system.",

Let's break down what's happening and how to approach this in the context of an online course:\n\n## What’s Happening?\n\n- **System Message is empty or generic:**  \n  The model produces \"garbage\" (i.e., unhelpful or incoherent output) when the system message is empty or simply says \"you are helpful assistant.\"\n- **System Message is explicit with structure:**  \n  When you provide a detailed instruction (especially with explicit output format using `<think>` and `<answer>` tags), the model performs as desired.\n\nThis suggests that:\n- **llama-server relies heavily on the system prompt** to shape both the quality and structure of its responses.\n- **llama-cli** may have a different default prompt or may process prompts differently, leading to better default behavior.\n\n## Why Does This Happen?\nMany open-source LLMs (including Llama variants) are \"instruction-following\" only when prompted accordingly. Without a strong, specific system message, they may:\n- Lack context for the desired output format\n- Default to generic or unstructured text generation\n- Not explicitly \"know\" to help or reason unless told to do so\n\n## Effective Instructional Strategies\n\n### 1. **Be Explicit in the System Message**\n- Always specify not just the assistant’s role, but also the output format and the reasoning process you want.\n- Example:  \n  ```\n  You are a helpful assistant. To answer the user's question, you first think about the reasoning process and then provide the user with the answer. The reasoning process and answer are enclosed within <think> </think> and <answer> </answer> tags, respectively, i.e., <think> reasoning process here </think> <answer> answer here </answer>.\n  ```\n\n### 2. **Standardize System Prompts Across Tools**\n- If you use both llama-cli and llama-server, set their system prompts to the same explicit instruction to reduce discrepancies.\n\n### 3. **Avoid Empty or Minimal Prompts**\n- Models like Llama do not have a \"default helpful mode\" when the prompt is empty. Always provide clear instructions for desired behavior.\n\n### 4. **Teach Prompt Engineering**\n- As part of your course, teach students why prompt design matters, and demonstrate how small changes in the system message can drastically alter output.\n\n### 5. **Provide Prompt Templates**\n- Offer a set of effective system prompts for different tasks (e.g., reasoning, summarization, Q&A with step-by-step thinking).\n\n### 6. **Experiment and Iterate**\n- Encourage learners to experiment with prompt wording and structure, observing how model behavior changes.\n\n## Example Exercise for Students\n\n> **Prompt Engineering Task:**  \n> 1. Start with an empty system message and test the model’s output for a factual question.  \n> 2. Try with “You are a helpful assistant.”  \n> 3. Try with a detailed system prompt specifying output format.  \n>  4. Compare and discuss the differences.  \n> **Goal:** Understand the importance of explicit system prompts.\n\n## Conclusion\n\n**Llama-server** (and similar LLM APIs) is highly prompt-dependent. For best results, always use explicit, detailed system messages—especially if you want reasoning steps or specific output structure. This is an important lesson for your online course, and a great opportunity to teach practical prompt engineering.\n\nIf you need sample prompts or further resources for your course, let me know!",

          "response": "Below are some ideas for teaching about system prompts and designing effective instructional strategies in your online course, especially when learners are comparing different interfaces (like llama-cli vs. llama-server) and experimenting with system prompts:\n\n1. Provide Context and Terminology  \n   • Define “system prompt.” Explain that it is the initial piece of guidance the large language model (LLM) receives and how it influences all subsequent outputs.  \n   • Show real-world examples—e.g., how ChatGPT, llama-cli, and llama-server handle system prompts differently—to illustrate why the same model can behave differently under different default settings.  \n\n2. Compare and Contrast Different Environments  \n   • Demonstrate llama-cli vs. llama-server. Show how llama-cli might include a default system prompt automatically while llama-server may require users to enter one (and thus can fail or produce “garbage” output if left blank).  \n   • Walk learners through side-by-side examples so they can see precisely how the system prompt changes both the style and correctness of responses.  \n\n3. Emphasize the Role of Clear Instructions  \n   • Show learners that more detailed system prompts (e.g., “You are a helpful assistant. … Reasoning process and answer in respective tags.”) can yield better-structured and more accurate answers than minimal instructions or blank prompts.  \n   • Encourage learners to experiment by refining system prompts to see how it affects the output.  \n\n4. Use Demonstrations and Guided Practice  \n   • Give a “before and after” demo: first omit the system prompt and compare the results to those produced when adding a carefully crafted system prompt.  \n   • Ask learners to modify specific parts of the prompt (e.g., adjusting the requested format or clarifying reasoning vs. answer) and observe how it changes responses.  \n\n5. Incorporate Real-World Scenarios  \n   • Present authentic tasks: “Imagine you are building a chatbot for customer service. Write a system prompt that ensures polite, concise, and accurate answers.”  \n   • Let learners apply these prompts in an actual test environment or sandbox so they gain hands-on experience solving practical problems with the LLM.  \n\n6. Scaffold the Learning Process  \n   • Progress from simple to complex prompts. Start with minimal prompts (“You are a helpful assistant.”) and gradually add instructions for structure, voice, or reasoning.  \n   • Include rule-based prompts (“Answer in a bullet-point format.”) and show how that changes the style of the output.  \n\n7. Encourage Reflection and Iteration  \n   • Invite learners to journal or discuss: “What happened when you left the system prompt blank? What changed when you added details?”  \n   • Provide multiple practice opportunities that allow for trial, error, and revision of system prompts.  \n\n8. Summarize Key Takeaways and Best Practices  \n   • Reinforce that consistency in providing a well-defined system prompt is essential for reliable results.  \n   • Show that even small shifts in wording can dramatically impact model responses.  \n   • Emphasize that the environment (cli vs. server) may have different default settings, so users should always check or specify those defaults.  \n\nBy combining explanation, demonstrations, hands-on exercises, and reflection, your online course learners will better understand why system prompts matter and how to craft them effectively—whether using llama-cli, llama-server, or any other LLM interface.",

          "success": false,
          "response": "Below is an explanation that both addresses the observation and outlines some strategies:\n\nObservation:\n• When you use a minimal or empty system message (for example, just “you are helpful assistant” or blank), the model running under llama-server produces unsatisfactory or “garbage” responses.\n• In contrast, when you supply an explicit system prompt that includes both role instructions and a detailed description of the desired chain‐of‐thought process (with clear delimiters such as <think>…</think> and <answer>…</answer>), the model responds in a better, controlled way.\n• This suggests that the server version and the CLI version are handling the “default” or implicit instructions differently. With llama-cli there might be a fallback or implicit behaviors that aren’t activated when using llama-server without detailed prompts.\n\nEffective Instructional Strategies:\n1. Explicit Chain‐of‐Thought Instructions:\n  • Instruct the model on exactly how to approach questions. For instance, specifying that it should “first think about the reasoning process” ensures the model internally organizes its work before generating a final answer.\n  • Use clear markers (for example, <think> and <answer> tags) to structure the output. This improves clarity and allows users (or downstream processes) to separate the reasoning from the final response.\n\n2. Detailed System Messages:\n  • Rather than relying on a default system prompt, provide the complete instructions as part of the system message. For example: \n   “You are a helpful assistant. To answer the user’s question, first think about the reasoning process and then provide the answer. The reasoning and answer should be enclosed in <think> </think> and <answer> </answer> tags respectively.”\n  • This explicit instruction helps the model understand not only its role but also the process and the desired output format.\n\n3. Consistency Across Environments:\n  • Given that different interfaces (llama-cli vs. llama-server) may have different default behaviors, it is a good idea to standardize your prompt instructions across platforms.\n  • Test your prompts in all deployment scenarios to ensure that they yield the expected structure, and modify them as necessary.\n\n4. Example-Based Training:\n  • Provide several exemplar interactions that illustrate the desired “chain-of-thought” followed by an answer. This can be used either in a training phase (if applicable) or as part of the prompt to “prime” the model.\n  • For instance, show a sample question with the tagged reasoning and answer; this will give the model a concrete example of what is expected.\n\n5. Adaptive Prompt Engineering:\n  • Recognize that minimal prompts may not trigger all the expected behaviors in some server environments. Experiment with small modifications of the prompt to see which state works best. \n  • Sometimes even phrasing “Let’s break this down step by step” or “Outline your thought process first” can help guide the model.\n\nSumming Up:\nYes—based on your observations, it appears that the minimal default system message used with llama-cli may be sufficient in one environment, but not when using llama-server. Thus, an effective strategy is to explicitly instruct the model on both the chain-of-thought reasoning and expected output format through a detailed system message. This approach reduces ambiguity and prevents “garbage” outputs. In essence, clear, detailed instructions, consistent formatting, and examples are key to shaping desirable outputs across different interfaces.",

To answer questions:\n1. First analyze the question in <think> tags\n2. Then provide your response in <answer> tags\n\nFormat: <think>reasoning here</think> <answer>response here</answer>\n```\n\n### 2. **Progressive Complexity Approach**\n- Start with working examples (like your successful prompt)\n- Show students how to modify gradually\n- Demonstrate what breaks and why\n\n### 3. **Model-Specific Guidelines**\nCreate templates for different model families:\n- **Llama models**: Often need explicit formatting instructions\n- **ChatML format**: `<|system|>`, `<|user|>`, `<|assistant|>`\n- **Alpaca format**: `### Instruction:`, `### Response:`\n\n### 4. **Debugging Methodology**\nTeach students to:\n1. Test with minimal working prompt first\n2. Add complexity incrementally\n3. Compare server vs CLI behavior\n4. Check model documentation for recommended formats\n\n### 5. **Best Practices Checklist**\n- Always include role definition\n- Specify output format explicitly\n- Include reasoning structure when needed\n- Test with simple queries first\n- Document what works for each model\n\n### 6. **Hands-on Labs**\nCreate exercises where students:\n- Compare empty vs populated system messages\n- Modify working prompts to understand components\n- Troubleshoot \"garbage\" outputs systematically\n\nThis approach helps students understand that server deployments require more explicit prompt engineering than CLI tools with built-in defaults.",

The reasoning process and answer are enclosed within <think> </think> and <answer> </answer> tags, respectively, i.e., <think> reasoning process here </think> <answer> answer here </answer>.\"\n- **Output:** Correct (desired behavior)\n- **Reason:** Clear, explicit instructions about expected format and process.\n\n## 2. **Differences Between llama-cli and llama-server**\n\n- **llama-cli:** May include a default system prompt when none is provided, or may have internal logic to handle empty system messages gracefully.\n- **llama-server:** Seems to require an explicit, well-formed system prompt; otherwise, outputs are poor.\n\n## 3. **Evaluation Criteria for System Message Handling**\n\nWhen conducting an expert review, you want to ensure the server handles system messages robustly and produces expected outputs. Here are suggested criteria:\n\n### A. **Clarity and Explicitness**\n- Does the system message provide clear, unambiguous instructions to the model?\n- Are the expected output formats and reasoning processes specified when needed?\n\n### B. **Robustness to Empty or Malformed Prompts**\n- What is the model's behavior when the system message is empty?\n- What happens if there are typos or malformed instructions?\n- (Desirable: The system should default to a reasonable fallback system prompt, or at least warn the user.)\n\n### C. **Consistency Across Interfaces**\n- Do llama-cli and llama-server produce the same output when given the same system message and user input?\n- Are there differences in default behavior or prompt handling?\n\n### D. **Output Quality**\n- Is the output relevant, coherent, and aligned with the intent of the user prompt?\n- Does the output follow formatting or tagging rules specified in the system message?\n\n### E. **Configurability and Documentation**\n- Is it clear to the user that the system message field is required or optional?\n- Are there examples or documentation for recommended system messages?\n\n## 4. **Suggested Evaluation Process**\n\n1. **Test Matrix:** Prepare a table of combinations:\n    - System message: empty, typo, minimal (\"You are a helpful assistant.\"), explicit (your detailed prompt)\n    - Input prompt: a standard user question\n    - Interface: llama-cli vs. llama-server\n\n2. **Output Review:** For each combination, record the output and rate:\n    - Relevance\n    - Coherence\n    - Adherence to instructions\n\n3. **Edge Cases:** Intentionally use malformed or empty system messages to test robustness.\n\n4. **Default Prompt Handling:** See if the system applies a default prompt when none is supplied, and whether this behavior is documented and consistent.\n\n5. **User Experience:** Assess whether the UI/UX informs the user of the importance of the system message field.\n\n## 5. **Summary Table Example**\n\n| System Message              | Interface     | Output Quality | Follows Format | Notes                |\n|-----------------------------|---------------|---------------|----------------|----------------------|\n| Empty                       | llama-cli     | Good/Bad      | Yes/No         |                      |\n| \"you are helpful assisant\"  | llama-server  | Bad           | No             | Typo                 |\n| Explicit format (detailed)  | llama-server  | Good          | Yes            | Works as expected    |\n| ...                         | ...           | ...           | ...            | ...                  |\n\n## 6. **Recommendations**\n\n- **Always use a clear, explicit system message, especially on llama-server.**\n- **Document the necessity of the system message for users.**\n- **If possible, have llama-server implement a reasonable default system prompt when the field is empty.**\n- **Use the above criteria to systematically evaluate server behavior and output quality.**\n\n---\n\n**In summary:**  \nFor expert review, use criteria such as clarity of the system message, robustness to empty/malformed prompts, consistency across interfaces, output quality, and user guidance/documentation. Systematically test combinations of system messages and interfaces to ensure reliable behavior.",

          "response": "When comparing how different system prompts or server/CLI configurations affect your model’s outputs, it helps to focus on objective, reproducible measures of quality and usability. Although the exact evaluation criteria will depend on your project, here are some commonly used dimensions:\n\n• Correctness: Are the answers factually accurate? If the output contains information that can be verified (e.g., mathematical steps, factual data), check whether it is correct.  \n• Clarity and Coherence: Is the generated text well-structured, correctly formatted, and easy to read? Does it stay on topic and make logical sense from beginning to end?  \n• Helpfulness/Relevance: Does the response actually address the question or task at hand? Does the model provide useful details, suggestions, or explanations rather than irrelevant or overly general text?  \n• Consistency with Instructions: Does the model adhere to the system prompt (e.g., using the requested format with <think> and <answer> tags)? If you ask the model not to reveal private reasoning, does it comply?  \n• User-Specific Metrics: Depending on your needs, you might incorporate domain-specific checks—such as whether the output follows certain style guides or business rules.  \n• Robustness and Stability: Does the model produce stable results across multiple runs and different prompts, or does it degrade significantly under slightly varied conditions?\n\nTo compare llama-cli and llama-server specifically, you could:\n\n1. Use the same prompt and input text for both the CLI and the server.  \n2. Log the outputs side by side.  \n3. Score or rank them against your chosen evaluation criteria.  \n\nKey differences often arise from how each tool handles system prompts, default prompts, and parameter settings (e.g., temperature, max tokens, etc.). By controlling these variables, you can better isolate which differences come from the prompt itself versus from differences in tool configurations.\n\nUltimately, selecting the “best” system prompt is an iterative process. If you find that your model only responds correctly (i.e., with minimal “garbage”) when you provide a more extensive system message—including instructions about how to reason and how to format the result—then it’s an indication that the model is sensitive to explicit instruction. Testing different prompts systematically, and evaluating the outputs with clear criteria for correctness, quality, and adherence to format, is the most effective way to identify what works best for your use case.",

          "response": "Below is an expert‐level summary and discussion of how to think about evaluating the system prompt behavior between llama‐cli and llama‐server.\n\n1. Understanding the Issue\n\n• When you supply a minimal or empty system message (\"you are helpful assisant\" or blank), the assistant produces “garbage” output. In contrast, when you supply a detailed system prompt that explicitly instructs the model to “first think about the reasoning process…” and encloses the chain‐of-thought and final answer within <think> and <answer> tags, the responses come out as expected.  \n• This indicates that the behavior of the assistant is quite sensitive to the system prompt content and may differ between llama‐cli and llama‐server in terms of how they apply or override default system instructions.\n\n2. Why the Difference May Occur\n\n• Different “clients” (llama‐cli versus llama‐server) may have different default behaviors regarding system messages. The server version might require explicit instructions in the system prompt to trigger the chain-of-thought or structured output.\n• A minimal or absent system message may leave the model “unsupervised” in how it formats or organizes its response. Even small typos (like “assisant”) might result in a failure to enforce the style you want, leading to output that doesn’t meet your expectations.\n\n3. Criteria for Evaluation\n\nAn expert evaluation should examine both the content and the context of responses. Here are the criteria you might use:\n\nA. Structural/Format Adherence  \n • Does the output follow the required format (i.e., is there a <think> … </think> portion and an <answer> … </answer> portion when that’s expected)?  \n • Is there a clear separation between the reasoning process and the final answer?  \n • Are the enclosing tags used correctly and consistently?\n\nB. Compliance with Instructions  \n • Does the response follow the system message’s instructions precisely? For example, if the instruction specifies “first think, then answer,” is that structure evident in the output?  \n • Are deviations minimal or do they obscure the intended chain-of-thought reasoning?\n\nC. Output Quality and Coherence  \n • Is the answer coherent, useful, and contextually relevant?  \n • Even if the output is structured as required, does it “make sense” and provide the expected information?\n • Is the chain-of-thought visible and helpful (i.e., does it outline reasoning without exposing internal computations unnecessarily)?\n\nD. Robustness and Consistency  \n • Does the system prompt work reliably across different invocations?  \n • Are there any edge cases (for example, slight variations in the system prompt text) that break the behavior?  \n • Comparing llama-cli and llama-server: does one consistently require an explicit, detailed system prompt while the other might use a built-in default? Understanding the limits of each system’s “default” assumptions is key.\n\nE. Sensitivity to Prompt Details  \n • How sensitive is the system to small changes in the instructions (e.g., spelling errors or slight omissions)?  \n • Does the system correctly interpret and respond when the system message is complete versus minimal?\n\n4. Summarizing the Difference (llama-cli vs. llama-server)\n\nBased on your findings, one might conclude that the llama-server version appears to require a fully specified, explicit system prompt to generate structured, high-quality (and chain-of-thought–enabled) output. In contrast, llama-cli might include a built-in default system prompt that, in effect, “fixes” some of these issues even when you leave the field empty. The underlying evaluation then should examine:\n\n• What default “behaviors” or fallback instructions each interface uses, and  \n• Whether those defaults meet your quality and formatting criteria.\n\n5. Final Thoughts\n\nFor evaluation, use a set of well-defined, measurable metrics:\n • Format compliance (presence and correct use of <think> and <answer>),\n • Instruction adherence (does the output follow “first think, then answer”),\n • Semantic quality (clarity, correctness, usefulness), and\n • Consistency (across multiple tests and slight prompt variations).\n\nThis approach provides a systematic way to compare and assess why the llama-server variant only “works” correctly when given a detailed system prompt versus the minimal default behavior of llama-cli.",

The llama-server implementation may handle system prompts differently than llama-cli\n2. Simple prompts like \"you are helpful assistant\" appear insufficient to properly initialize the model's behavior\n3. The more structured prompt with explicit formatting instructions works correctly\n\n## Technical Explanation\n\nThis discrepancy likely occurs because:\n\n- Llama models (especially open-source ones) often require more explicit instruction formatting compared to models like GPT\n- The CLI might be applying additional formatting or context that the server doesn't\n- The server implementation may be passing the system message directly without the wrapper context that makes it effective\n\n## Criteria for Evaluation\n\nWhen evaluating system prompts for llama-server, consider these criteria:\n\n1. **Explicitness**: Does the prompt clearly define the expected behavior and output format?\n2. **Completeness**: Does it include both role definition and formatting instructions?\n3. **Structure**: Does it provide clear boundaries for different parts of the response?\n4. **Consistency**: Does it produce reliable outputs across different queries?\n5. **Compatibility**: Is it formatted appropriately for the specific model implementation?\n\n## Recommendation\n\nContinue using the more detailed system prompt that works. The format-specific instructions appear to be necessary for proper model initialization in the server context. This is actually a common pattern with open-source LLMs, which often require more explicit guidance than proprietary models.\n\nFor future testing, you might want to create a standard set of test queries to evaluate prompt effectiveness systematically across both CLI and server implementations.",

You're noticing a real and important difference in behavior between **llama-cli** and **llama-server**, and your observations touch on both practical and philosophical implications in prompt engineering and AI alignment.\n\n### Technical/Practical Considerations\n\n1. **Prompt Engineering Sensitivity**\n   - The phrasing and structure of the system prompt greatly affect the model's behavior. Llama models (like most LLMs) are sensitive to context, instructions, and formatting.\n   - \"You are helpful assistant\" is quite vague. It leaves the model to guess what \"helpful\" means, and provides no structural cues.\n   - The more explicit system prompt, specifying tags and reasoning steps, gives the model a clear format and task, leading to better results.\n\n2. **Server vs. CLI Differences**\n   - **llama-cli** may add its own prompt structure or system message by default, which can compensate for an empty or vague system prompt.\n   - **llama-server** might pass your system message verbatim (or even nothing, if left empty), so the model has less context or instruction, leading to poor output.\n   - There may be differences in how user/system messages are formatted or injected into the prompt between the two tools.\n\n3. **Default Prompts**\n   - Some tools (like OpenAI's API) have implicit default system prompts (\"You are ChatGPT...\"). If llama-server has no default, the burden is on you to provide a good prompt.\n\n### Philosophical Implications\n\n1. **Prompt as an Ontology**\n   - The system message acts as a kind of *ontological foundation* for the conversation. It tells the model \"who it is,\" \"what it should do,\" and \"how it should express itself.\"\n   - The difference between \"garbage\" and \"good\" output can hinge on the *precision* and *completeness* of this initial instruction.\n\n2. **Agency and Alignment**\n   - The model is *not* truly an agent, but its behavior is shaped by the instructions you provide. Without sufficient guidance (as in a vague or missing prompt), the model's output is unpredictable.\n   - The system message is a primary tool for *alignment*—getting the model to behave in ways that are useful, safe, and comprehensible.\n\n3. **Transparency and Control**\n   - Relying on implicit defaults (as in llama-cli) can be convenient, but may hide important details from the user.\n   - Being explicit (as you must be with llama-server) makes you more aware of *how* the AI is being shaped, which is philosophically desirable for understanding and control.\n\n### What Should You Consider?\n\n- **Always use a detailed, explicit system prompt with llama-server.** Don't rely on defaults unless you have verified their presence and quality.\n- **Test your prompts.** Small changes can have large effects; iterate and observe.\n- **Understand the tool's default behavior.** Read docs or source code to know exactly what prompt is being sent to the model.\n- **Recognize the philosophical stakes.** Your system prompt is not just a technical detail—it's a statement of what you want the AI to be.\n\n---\n\n**Summary Table:**\n\n| Tool         | System Message Needed? | Output Quality | Philosophical Note                 |\n|--------------|-----------------------|---------------|------------------------------------|\n| llama-cli    | Sometimes optional    | Usually good  | Defaults may hide prompt structure |\n| llama-server | Required (explicit)   | Varies        | Forces explicit alignment          |\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe system message is the *ground of being* for your AI assistant. With llama-server, you are responsible for defining that ground. Consider your instructions carefully—they determine not just the output, but the very nature of your assistant's \"self.\"\n\nIf you want to discuss this further (e.g., implications for AI ethics, agency, or communication), let me know!",

          "response": "When you notice that llama-cli honors your system prompt but llama-server does not, it usually comes down to how each tool interprets and inserts the “system message” under the hood. A few things to consider:\n\n1) Prompt Format Differences:  \n   • llama-cli might be automatically placing your system message before user messages with an “instruct” style format (i.e., adding special tokens or prompt templates).  \n   • llama-server might be ignoring or omitting the system message if it’s left empty or if it does not match the prompt format it expects.\n\n2) Configuration Options:  \n   • Make sure you have the correct flags or settings enabled (e.g., “--instruct,” “use_system_prompt,” etc.) in llama-server if those are available.  \n   • Some servers have an explicit “System Prompt” section or configuration file where you manually place text. If that’s empty, they might skip the entire system-message logic.\n\n3) Tagging or Wrapping the Reasoning:  \n   • In your example, you included special tags, <think> and <answer>, which helped structure the output. If llama-cli has a built-in prompt that recognizes or respects those tags, while llama-server does not, you may get inconsistent results.  \n   • Check if llama-server requires its own version of a “role-based” or “instruct” prompt template for those tags to work.\n\n4) Version Mismatches or Implementation Details:  \n   • If llama-cli and llama-server are running different versions of Llama or different back-end libraries (e.g., different branches of llama.cpp), they may not treat system prompts the same way.  \n   • Confirm that both environments are in sync or that you’re adapting each one’s recommended prompt format correctly.\n\nIn short, llama-cli might be handling your system message with a built-in instruct template, whereas llama-server may need explicit configuration to place that text into the correct position of the prompt. Make sure you’ve checked the server’s documentation about system messages, verify you’re passing the right flags (and that you’re not leaving that field empty), and replicate the same prompting approach across both tools for consistent results.",

          "response": "There are a few key points to consider when you see different behaviors between your CLI and your server setups:\n\n1. The role of the system prompt: In many LLM implementations the system prompt plays a critical role in setting the behavior of the assistant. In your llama-server setup the system message isn’t simply decoration—it is used to condition the model’s internal state. If your prompt is too minimal (“you are helpful assisant”) or left empty, the model might not be primed with enough context to produce coherent output.\n\n2. The power of explicit instructions: With the detailed system message that tells the assistant to “first think about the reasoning process” and wrap the output in <think>…</think> and <answer>…</answer> tags, you’re providing a very explicit structure. This extra guidance helps the model know not only what role to play but also how to format its response. When using a simpler or empty prompt, the expected structure isn’t present and you may end up with what you call “garbage.”\n\n3. Differences between CLI and server implementations: It sounds like the llama-cli might be using its own default reasoning process or additional pipeline tricks (perhaps a default chain-of-thought or a specific formatting that is automatically applied), while the llama-server isn’t. This would mean that in the server environment the system message is even more critical for proper behavior, as it might not have as many fallback defaults.\n\n4. Attention to detail in the prompt: A small difference—a misspelled word such as “assisant” instead of “assistant”—can sometimes affect the functioning if the model or server code is sensitive to exact phrasing or if it’s meant to trigger a particular behavior. Even if a tiny error might seem inconsequential, it’s worth verifying consistency between the environments.\n\n5. Philosophical underpinnings: This discrepancy touches on a deeper philosophical point about language models. They don’t “know” the abstract roles we assign them unless we explicitly encode those instructions in context. The act of “priming” the model with the right system message is similar to giving it an identity and a purpose. Without this explicit instruction, what it outputs can be drastically different and may not align with our expectations.\n\nIn summary, if you can use the default system prompt with llama-cli but not with llama-server, you should:\n\n• Ensure that the system prompt in the server is as detailed and explicit as needed to guide the output.\n• Verify that there are no differences in configuration between the CLI and server that might explain differing default behaviors.\n• Consider that the server may require more explicit chain-of-thought or formatting instructions and that slight changes in the system message (or its absence) can have a large impact on how the model organizes and presents its output.\n\nBy adjusting the system prompt to be explicit and detailed, you help the model “understand” the task and produce the intended structure of its response.",

Here are a few things to consider:\n\n1. **Prompt Engineering**: The system message appears to play a crucial role in shaping the output of the language model. When the system message is empty or contains \"garbage\", the output is also garbage, indicating that the system message is a key part of the prompt that the model uses to generate its response.\n\n2. **Contextual Dependence**: The language model seems to be highly dependent on the context provided by the system message. When the system message is well-crafted and provides clear instructions on the model's role and expected behavior, the output is more coherent and aligned with the user's intent. This suggests that the language model's performance is heavily influenced by the contextual information it is given.\n\n3. **Emergent Behavior**: The fact that the model behaves differently with different system messages points to the possibility of emergent behavior. The language model may be able to learn and adapt its responses based on the provided context, rather than simply executing a pre-programmed set of instructions.\n\n4. **Interpretability and Transparency**: The discrepancy in behavior between the LLaMA CLI and LLaMA server settings raises questions about the interpretability and transparency of the language model's internal workings. It's unclear why the model responds differently to the same system message in different contexts, and this lack of explainability could be a concern for users who need to understand and trust the model's outputs.\n\n5. **Generalization and Robustness**: The fact that the model's performance is so heavily dependent on the specific wording of the system message suggests that it may not be as generalizable or robust as one might hope. Small changes in the prompt can lead to drastically different outputs, which could be problematic in real-world applications where the model needs to handle a variety of inputs and contexts.\n\nIn summary, the behavior you've observed with the LLaMA system message highlights the importance of prompt engineering, the contextual dependence of language models, the potential for emergent behavior, and the need for greater interpretability and transparency in these systems. As you continue to explore the philosophical implications, it may be worth considering these factors and how they relate to the broader challenges and opportunities in the field of artificial intelligence.",

Let's break down and model what is happening:\n\n### Key Factors\n\n1. **System Message Design**  \n   The system message acts as the \"instructions\" for the model.  \n   - **Simple/Generic message**: (\"you are helpful assistant\") or **Empty**  \n     - Output is garbage. The model lacks clear direction or structure, so its responses are unpredictable.  \n   - **Explicit, Structured message**:  \n     - Adding a detailed instruction (about <think> and <answer> tags) guides the model to produce output in a predictable, useful format.\n\n2. **Difference Between llama-cli and llama-server**  \n   - **llama-cli**: May have built-in/system prompts, pre-processing, or context handling that the server version does not replicate exactly.  \n   - **llama-server**: Relies directly on the system message you provide; if it's too minimal, the model \"flails.\"\n\n3. **Prompt Engineering Sensitivity**  \n   - Some deployment methods (CLI vs. server) handle context, formatting, or system prompts differently.\n   - LLMs are very sensitive to prompt wording and structure, especially for specialized output formats.\n\n### How to Model This\n\n#### 1. **Component Model**\n\n- **Inputs:**  \n  - System message  \n  - User message\n\n- **Processing:**  \n  - **llama-cli:** [May apply extra implicit system prompt or formatting]  \n  - **llama-server:** [Applies your system message as-is]\n\n- **Model Behavior:**  \n  - *If system message is generic or empty*: Output is erratic  \n  - *If system message is explicit/structured*: Output follows expected format\n\n#### 2. **System Prompt Dependency Model**\n\n| Deployment      | System Message         | Output Quality | Notes                                     |\n|-----------------|-----------------------|---------------|-------------------------------------------|\n| llama-cli       | Default (unspecified) | Good          | CLI adds its own helpful prompt           |\n| llama-server    | Empty/generic         | Bad           | Needs explicit, structured instructions   |\n| llama-server    | Structured/explicit   | Good          | Model follows detailed instructions       |\n\n#### 3. **Guidance for Usage/Simulation**\n\n- **llama-server requires a strong, explicit system prompt**—model this as a \"hard requirement\" for good output.\n- **llama-cli has a built-in system prompt**—model this as having an \"implicit default\" that works well.\n- **Conclusion:**  \n  When designing your simulation scenario, always provide a detailed, structured system message for llama-server. Otherwise, output quality cannot be guaranteed.\n\n> **If your simulation must work with both llama-cli and llama-server, always use a detailed system prompt.**\n\n### Example Modeling Template\n\n```yaml\nllm_system_prompting:\n  llama-cli:\n    system_prompt: \"Default (implicit, works well)\"\n    requires_explicit_prompt: false\n    output_quality: \"good\"\n  llama-server:\n    system_prompt: \"(user-supplied)\"\n    requires_explicit_prompt: true\n    output_quality:\n      generic_or_empty: \"garbage\"\n      explicit_structured: \"good\"\n```\n\n### Recommendation\n\n- For **llama-server**, always include a detailed, explicit system message that covers desired output format and reasoning steps.\n- Document this requirement for team members/deployers: \"llama-server does not apply a helpful default system prompt; you must supply one for reliable results.\"\n\n---\n\n**Summary Table:**\n\n| Interface     | System Message Required? | Accepts Default? | Output w/ Explicit? | Output w/ Generic/Empty? |\n|---------------|-------------------------|------------------|---------------------|--------------------------|\n| llama-cli     | No                      | Yes              | Good                | Good                     |\n| llama-server  | Yes (explicit)          | No               | Good                | Garbage                  |\n\n---\n\n**Bottom line:**  \nllama-server is more \"bare metal\" and requires strong prompt engineering.

Conversely, providing a carefully structured system prompt (like the one you mention with <think> and <answer> tags) produces coherent results.\n\nTo model this behavior, you can think of the system prompt as an essential input to the model’s “role” or “persona.” Whether in llama-cli or llama-server, the model always looks for (or expects) system-level instructions at the start of the conversation. However, the exact mechanics can differ in two ways:\n\n1. Default Prompt Handling:\n   • llama-cli may come with a built-in fallback or a default system instruction when you’ve not specified one.  \n   • llama-server may not apply any fallback prompts if its “System Message” field is empty, resulting in “garbage” outputs.\n\n2. Prompt Construction Workflow:\n   • In some setups, the system prompt is automatically combined with user prompts into a single conversation context before sending to the model.  \n   • In others, you need to manually ensure the system prompt is included at the very beginning.\n\nTo address your question of “How should we model this?” you can do the following:\n\n• Consistently Provide a System Prompt:  \n  In any environment (CLI tool or web/server interface) where your prompt might be empty, make sure you explicitly supply a meaningful system message so that the model has a clear “role” and set of instructions.\n\n• Ensure the Same Prompt Format:  \n  If you like the <think>/<answer> methodology, keep that same pattern in both llama-cli and llama-server. Decide on a single structure for your system prompt and ensure it gets injected into the conversation context for both tools.\n\n• Configure a Sensible Fallback:  \n  If you want the server to behave similarly to the CLI when the “System Message” field is empty, you could configure llama-server to automatically insert a default system prompt (e.g., “You are a helpful assistant…”). This prevents “empty system prompt” scenarios that lead to nonsensical output.\n\n• Track System vs. User Messages Internally:  \n  In some cases, you may need to verify how the server is labeling or ordering messages (system vs. user vs. assistant). The model might behave oddly if system instructions aren’t placed first.\n\nIn short, the discrepancy comes from how llama-server handles (or doesn’t handle) a missing system prompt, whereas llama-cli appears to have a different fallback or behavior. The key is to consistently pass in a robust system prompt—potentially the one with <think> and <answer> instructions—to both the command-line tool and the server, ensuring you get stable results in each environment.",

          "response": "The core observation is that the system message isn’t just setting the “persona” of the assistant—it’s also instructing the model on the desired output format. In your tests, when you left the system message empty or just used “you are helpful assisant” (with a typo), the server wasn’t given any clear guidance on how to structure its answer. When you explicitly include the two-part instruction with the <think> and <answer> tags, you get the intended behavior.\n\nThis implies that the llama-server (or more precisely, your configuration using it) relies entirely on what’s provided in the system message for two things:\n • Defining the assistant’s persona\n • Dictating the expected output formatting and processing pipeline\n\nBy contrast, the llama-cli setup must have an internal default prompt that supplies the missing “chain-of-thought” instructions, so even when you don’t pass them in, it manages to produce reasonable output.\n\nSo to model your simulation scenario correctly you need to adjust the design with the following points in mind:\n\n1. Explicitly Provide Formatting/Reasoning Instructions: \n • If you want your responses to include a chain-of-thought (the thinking step) and then the final answer (each within its own tag), you must always provide that directive as part of the system message. This becomes a “meta prompt” that ensures the output is structured.\n\n2. Handle Defaults Consistently:\n • Decide whether you want the simulation to always have structured output or if it should sometimes produce “normal” text. If you want to support both behaviors, then add a logic layer: if the system message is empty (or missing the formatting instructions), either inject a default system message (like in llama-cli) or configure the llama-server to fall back to a baseline system prompt that includes formatting directives.\n\n3. Ensure Correct Spelling and Instructions:\n • Note that a typo (like “assisant”) in your default instructions can lead to garbled results. Thus, the “default system prompt” must be validated before it’s applied.\n\n4. Simulation Mode Flag:\n • Because the server and CLI behave differently, consider modeling a simulation “mode” where you explicitly choose between “default chain-of-thought mode” (system message with <think> and <answer> tags) and “direct mode” (no additional formatting instructions). This way, you can make the behavior explicit on both the CLI and server sides.\n\n5. Consistent API Behavior:\n • Finally, if the simulation scenario is intended to be agnostic of the underlying implementation (CLI vs. Server), you might need to adapt the llama-server code to automatically adopt a safe, default formatting instruction when its “System Message” field is empty. That would essentially mimic the default behavior of llama-cli.\n\nIn short, the key factor is that the llama-server expects you to fully specify both the assistant’s persona and the formatting instructions within the system prompt. For your simulation, it’s best to model it as having two layers:\n • A baseline “persona” instruction (which can be the default assistant behavior) and\n • An output specification layer (which tells the model to respond with a two-part structure, using <think> and <answer> tags).\n\nBy doing so, you ensure that, regardless of whether you’re using llama-cli or llama-server, the input guiding the model is explicit and complete.",

In your case, the system message that works correctly with the llama-server seems to have a specific format with the <think> and <answer> tags.\n\n2. **System Message Length**: The llama-server may have a limit on the length or complexity of the system message, and the shorter messages may not be processed correctly.\n\n3. **System Message Interpretation**: The llama-server may have a different way of interpreting and applying the system message compared to the llama-cli. This could be due to differences in the underlying language models or the way the system message is integrated into the overall system.\n\n4. **Server-specific Configurations**: The llama-server may have additional configurations or settings that affect the way the system message is handled, and these configurations may not be present or accessible in the llama-cli.\n\nTo model this behavior, you could try the following:\n\n1. **Investigate the Documentation**: Check the documentation for the llama-server to see if there are any specific requirements or guidelines for the system message format and structure.\n\n2. **Experiment with Different System Messages**: Try different variations of the system message, including different lengths, structures, and content, to see how the llama-server responds in each case.\n\n3. **Examine the Server Logs**: Check the server logs for any error messages or clues that might shed light on how the system message is being processed and interpreted.\n\n4. **Communicate with the Developers**: If you're unable to resolve the issue on your own, consider reaching out to the developers of the llama-server to understand the specific implementation details and any known limitations or requirements around the system message.\n\nBy understanding the specific requirements and limitations of the llama-server's system message handling, you can better model the behavior and ensure that your simulation scenario accurately reflects the actual system's capabilities and constraints.",

Here’s an explanation of the dynamics at play:\n\n---\n\n**1. System Messages Define Model Behavior**  \nThe “System Message” (or “system prompt”) sets the ground rules for the conversation. It tells the model how to behave, what persona to take, and sometimes even how to format its output.\n\n- **Short or missing system messages** (“you are helpful assistant” or empty):  \n  These provide very little instruction. Many models default to generic, sometimes unstructured responses, or may even behave erratically (“garbage output”) because they lack guidance.\n\n- **Detailed, structured system messages** (like your example with <think> and <answer> tags):  \n  These give the model explicit instructions on how to reason and how to format its reply. This helps the model “stay on track” and output useful, predictable responses.\n\n---\n\n**2. Why the Difference Between llama-cli and llama-server?**\n\n- **llama-cli**  \n  This may have additional built-in logic or defaults that compensate for weak or missing system prompts. It might “help” the model behave more consistently, even with minimal instructions.\n\n- **llama-server**  \n  This often exposes the model more “raw,” relying entirely on the system message you provide. If the system message is empty or vague, the model can “go off the rails” and produce poor output.\n\n**This is normal:**  \n- Different serving tools may handle system messages, prompts, and context in subtly different ways.\n- Some inject extra prompt engineering behind the scenes; others expect you to do all the prompt engineering yourself.\n\n---\n\n**3. The Dynamics: Why Does This Happen?**\n\n- **Prompt sensitivity:**  \n  LLMs, especially ones like Llama, are highly sensitive to the initial prompt. Explicit instructions (as in your detailed system message) make a big difference.\n- **Server implementation:**  \n  CLI tools may have defaults or guardrails that servers lack.\n- **Formatting requirements:**  \n  Your server seems to expect formatted output (with <think> and <answer>), and if it doesn’t get it, things break down.\n\n---\n\n**Summary Table of Dynamics:**\n\n| Tool         | System Message Quality | Output Quality      | Why?                                    |\n|--------------|-----------------------|---------------------|------------------------------------------|\n| llama-cli    | Weak/Empty            | Sometimes decent    | May inject defaults/guardrails           |\n| llama-server | Weak/Empty            | Garbage             | Expects explicit, detailed instructions  |\n| llama-server | Detailed/Explicit     | Works as expected   | Model gets clear instructions and format |\n\n---\n\n**What’s “normal”?**\n- It’s normal for different serving frameworks to behave differently depending on the prompt.  \n- It’s normal for LLMs to need explicit guidance, especially when exposed “raw” through APIs/servers.\n\n---\n\n**Best Practice:**  \nAlways use a detailed, explicit system message, especially with server-based LLM deployments. Treat prompt engineering as part of your application logic.\n\n---\n\n**In short:**  \nYes, this is a normal part of life when working with LLMs and different serving tools. The dynamics are rooted in how much prompt engineering and “hand-holding” each tool does for you. The more “raw” the LLM, the more work you (the developer) need to do with the system prompt!\n\nIf you’d like more technical details about how to make your system robust across both llama-cli and llama-server, let me know!",

System Messages. In many LLM setups, there’s a designated “system message” slot used to give the model a fixed instruction or role. Some implementations treat that slot as crucial context for the language model, while others simply omit it if it’s empty. (For instance, if the system message is blank or too minimal, the model might not receive enough direction, leading to low-quality or “garbage” outputs.)\n\n2. Prompt Handling Differences. llama-cli and llama-server may handle the system message and user prompt differently. One might always prepend the system message internally (even if it’s empty), while the other might attach it differently to the conversation. If one interface expects a well-crafted system instruction and the other either automatically provides one or ignores it at runtime, there can be noticeable output differences.\n\n3. Importance of Clear Instructions. Large language models often do better when given explicit instructions or well-structured hints (like “You are a helpful assistant…”). It helps the model stay “in character” and produce coherent answers. A blank or vague system message can force the model to guess the context or style of response, leading to unpredictability.\n\nIn short, yes, it’s normal for the output to vary based on the presence and quality of the system message—especially if llama-cli and llama-server implement that part of the prompt differently.

          "response": "In many “prompt‐injection”–style setups, the system prompt isn’t simply an invisible default that always works the same way. Instead, it’s a piece of text inserted into the context that the language model sees before any user message. Different interfaces (or “runtimes”) can handle this insertion differently.\n\nHere’s what’s likely happening in your simulation:\n\n1. Default versus explicit instructions:\n • With llama‑cli the creator likely built in a “default system prompt” behind the scenes so that even if you leave the system field empty (or type something brief like “you are helpful assisant” with a typo), the model still benefits from an internal chain‐of‐thought (CoT) mechanism.\n • With llama‑server, however, the system prompt becomes the highest–priority instruction. If you leave it empty or use a very minimal one, the intended chain–of–thought guidance (which tells the model to “first think about … then output…” using <think> and <answer> tags) isn’t present, and the generated output can come out “garbage” (i.e. mis‐aligned with your expectations).\n\n2. The role of explicit chain–of–thought tags:\n • When you supply a detailed system message such as\n  \"You are a helpful assistant. To answer the user's question, you first think about the reasoning process and then provide the user with the answer. The reasoning process and answer are enclosed within <think> </think> and <answer> </answer> tags, respectively, i.e., <think> reasoning process here </think> <answer> answer here </answer>.\"\n  the model is explicitly instructed to separate its internal reasoning from the final answer. In that case the model does what you expect.\n • In the absence of these detailed instructions (or if a typo like “assisant” appears), the model might not know it has to “structure” its output—resulting in output that feels garbled or unhelpful.\n\n3. Dynamics between the two systems:\n • The CLI version might be “hard–wired” to include certain chain–of–thought steps or use additional context that you don’t automatically see in the server version.\n • The server version relies exclusively on what’s in the “System Message” field. If you leave it empty, you lose that extra hidden context or the carefully crafted instructions that guide the model’s reasoning and final answer formatting.\n • In other words, when using llama‑server, if you want your answer formatted properly (with the <think>…</think> and <answer>…</answer> tags) you must supply an explicit instruction that replicates the full “meta–prompt” (or chain–of–thought prompt) that might be implicitly present in llama‑cli.\n\n4. A “normal” part of life in prompt engineering:\n • It is very common that different interfaces implement system prompt insertion or intermediate instructions differently.\n • This is why sometimes a prompt that works well in one interface (or application of the model) does not work as expected in another, and why attention to the exact wording (and even typos) in the system prompt becomes crucial.\n\nIn summary, the dynamics in your simulation come down to how the system prompt is used to “prime” the model. With llama‑cli, a default chain–of–thought construction is built in even when you leave the field blank or use minimal instructions, but with llama‑server that isn’t the case—so unless you provide the complete, detailed instruction (including the reasoning tags), the model’s output can appear garbled. This difference isn’t unusual; it reflects the way different implementations handle the context injection and prompt engineering.",

When the message is \"you are a helpful assistant\", the model may not have enough information or direction to provide a coherent response. However, when the message is more detailed and structured, it gives the model a clear framework to follow, leading to better outputs.\n\n2. **Prompt Sensitivity**: Language models can be highly sensitive to the specific phrasing and structure of the prompts they receive. Small changes in the prompt can result in vastly different outputs, as the model tries to interpret and respond to the nuances of the prompt. This sensitivity is a known characteristic of large language models.\n\n3. **Implementation Differences**: The difference in behavior between the llama-cli and llama-server could be due to differences in the implementation or configuration of the two environments. The server settings may be applying additional processing or constraints to the system message that are not present in the standalone cli tool.\n\n4. **Generalization Capabilities**: The more detailed and structured system message may be providing the model with enough context and guidance to generalize and reason about the task, rather than simply generating a response based on surface-level patterns. The more open-ended or ambiguous prompts may be challenging the model's ability to generalize effectively.\n\nIn summary, the dynamics at play here likely involve the crucial role of prompt engineering and the sensitivity of language models to the specific phrasing and structure of the prompts they receive.

Here's what's likely happening:\n\n1. **Implementation differences**: The llama-cli might have built-in default handling for simple system messages like \"you are helpful assistant\" that the server version doesn't implement the same way.\n\n2. **Context formatting**: Server implementations often require more explicit formatting instructions because they don't apply the same default wrappers or processing that CLI versions might include automatically.\n\n3. **Prompt engineering importance**: Your successful system message works because it provides explicit structure (the thinking/answer tags) that guides the model's output format, rather than just describing its role.\n\nThis is why many production LLM deployments use carefully crafted system messages with explicit formatting instructions rather than simple role descriptions. The server implementation is essentially \"raw\" and expects you to provide complete instructions, while the CLI might add some default processing to make simple prompts work better.\n\nIf you need consistent behavior across both environments, using the more detailed system message that explicitly structures the output is the right approach.\n</answer>",

These are good elements to highlight in a factual documentary:\n\n1. Purpose of the System Message  \n   • Explains why many large language model (LLM) systems rely on a system prompt to configure the model’s overall behavior (e.g., being concise, polite, or focusing on factual responses).  \n   • Demonstrates that a carefully crafted system prompt can change the style, format, or quality of the output.  \n\n2. How Different Implementations Handle the Prompt  \n   • llama-cli may embed the default system prompt by design, whereas llama-server might require an explicit system message to function as intended.  \n   • When the system message is empty or too minimal (“you are a helpful assistant”), some servers might discard or ignore the prompt, resulting in disorganized or “garbage” output.  \n\n3. Importance of Prompt Structure  \n   • Shows that a more explicit prompt (like one containing “<think>” and “<answer>” placeholders) can guide the model’s reasoning and format.  \n   • Emphasizes how structured instructions can yield consistent, higher-quality responses compared to informal or absent instructions.  \n\n4. Configuration Differences Between Tools  \n   • Many open-source tools have slightly different defaults (e.g., how they preserve or strip system prompts), leading to variations in output quality.  \n   • Illustrates the effect of default hyperparameters, prompt tokens, or maximum context length on responses.  \n\n5. Best Practices and Troubleshooting  \n   • Advises users to review each tool’s documentation on specifying and preserving system messages.  \n   • Recommends testing variations of the prompt to see which yields the best, most coherent results for a given application.  \n\n6. Practical Examples  \n   • Demonstrates excerpts where the system prompt is changed, showing the difference in how llama-cli versus llama-server interprets and formats the final answer.  \n   • Highlights real-world use cases: a short system prompt for quick queries vs. a more complex prompt for structured, longer answers.\n\nBy covering these core elements, you can document how the “System Message (will be disabled if left empty)” setting influences an LLM’s behavior, why certain prompts produce “garbage” output, and why the full, well-structured system message helps ensure more coherent responses.",

The default or overly simplistic prompts (\"You are a helpful assistant.\" or empty prompt) often lead to poor or unstructured results (\"garbage\"), as the model lacks explicit instructions on how to format its output and reason about the input.\n\n### Why Does This Happen?\n\n- **Prompt Sensitivity**: LLaMA-based models and many open-source LLMs do not inherently have built-in alignment or formatting behaviors. They rely heavily on explicit instructions in the prompt to guide their reasoning and response generation process.\n- **No Default Formatting**: Unlike some proprietary models (such as OpenAI's GPT-3.5/4 APIs, which have internal alignment layers and dialogue formatting), open-source models like LLaMA often require explicit prompting that clearly instructs the model on how to reason and structure output.\n- **Structured Output Requirements**: Models often perform significantly better when explicitly instructed to reason step-by-step and explicitly directed to enclose reasoning processes and final answers in clearly defined tags (e.g., `<think>` and `<answer>` tags). Without clear instructions, the model might output random, irrelevant, or poorly formatted text.\n\n### Core Elements to Include in the System Prompt\n\nTo achieve good performance and structured output, ensure your system message (prompt) contains these essential, explicit instructions:\n\n#### 1. **Clear Role Definition**\nExplicitly tell the model what role it is supposed to assume:\n```\n\"You are a helpful assistant.\"\n```\n\n#### 2. **Explicit Reasoning Instructions**\nGuide the model to think step-by-step. For example:\n```\n\"You reason step-by-step to ensure the correctness of your answers.\"\n```\n\n#### 3. **Structured Output Format**\nClearly specify formatting requirements. For example:\n```\n\"Provide your reasoning enclosed within <think> </think> tags, and produce your final answer enclosed within <answer> </answer> tags.\"\n```\n\n#### 4. **Example Structure**\nProviding an example structure in the system prompt helps considerably:\n```\nExample:\n<think>\nStep 1: Analyze question...\nStep 2: Consider relevant facts...\nStep 3: Deduce answer...\n</think>\n<answer>Your final concise answer here.</answer>\n```\n\n### Recommended minimal structured system prompt:\nYou can simplify slightly from your working example, but retain the key elements:\n\n```\nYou are a helpful assistant. Always reason step-by-step before giving your answer. Enclose your reasoning in <think>...</think> tags and your final answer in <answer>...</answer> tags.\n```\n\n### Why does llama-cli work differently from llama-server?\n\n- **Prompt Handling Differences**: llama-cli is typically designed around directly inputting full, structured prompts including explicit instructions. llama-server, on the other hand, often expects a clearly defined \"system message\" separate from user input. If the system message is empty or insufficient, the model might be missing crucial context needed to produce good outputs.\n- **Defaults & Templates**: llama-cli might internally insert default prompts or formatting that llama-server does not. You must explicitly provide the required structure in llama-server to get consistent results.\n\n### Conclusion:\nTo reliably generate structured, coherent responses with llama-server, explicitly provide detailed instructions in the system message. The minimal core elements are:\n\n- Define assistant role clearly  \n- Explicitly instruct the model to reason step-by-step  \n- Clearly specify the format for reasoning and answer tags  \n\nUsing these principles, your system prompt should yield consistent, structured, and correct outputs.",

          "response": "You’ve identified an important distinction between how the **system message** (or system prompt) is handled in different tools—specifically between **llama-cli** and **llama-server** (or similar Llama-based inference servers).\n\nLet’s break down what’s happening and why:\n\n---\n\n## 1. Purpose of the System Message\n\n- The **system message** (system prompt) sets the context and instructions for the language model before it starts responding to user input.\n- It’s critical for steering the model’s behavior, tone, and output formatting.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Your Observations\n\n- **Simple/empty system message:**  \n  - (`\"You are helpful assistant\"` or empty) → Output is not as desired (garbage).\n- **Detailed system message with structure:**  \n  - (`\"You are a helpful assistant. To answer the user's question ... <think> ... </think> <answer> ... </answer>.\"`) → Output is structured and correct.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Why is this happening?\n\n### a. System Message Importance\nLlama models (and most LLMs) are extremely sensitive to prompt engineering. The more explicitly you instruct them—especially regarding output format—the better the results.\n\n- **Generic prompts** (“You are a helpful assistant”) don’t tell the model *how* to answer, just that it should be helpful.\n- **Detailed prompts** (“Answer using <think> and <answer> tags...”) explicitly instruct the model, so it follows the desired structure.\n\n### b. Tool Differences: llama-cli vs. llama-server\n\n**llama-cli** and **llama-server** might handle input formatting differently:\n- **llama-cli** may automatically prepend or merge your system message with the user input, possibly using some internal formatting or separators.\n- **llama-server** (like those based on llamacpp-server, etc.) often expects you to provide the *entire* conversation context, including roles (system, user, assistant), and may not inject the prompt in the same way.\n\nThis means:\n- If you don’t provide a clear, detailed system prompt with explicit instructions, the model may not know what you want, especially in a stateless or API-driven server setup.\n\n---\n\n## 4. Recommendations & Guidance\n\n### a. Always Use Explicit, Structured System Prompts\n\nFor Llama models (especially when running in server mode), always provide a detailed prompt that:\n- Tells the model who it is and what to do.\n- Specifies output format (if you need a certain format).\n- Optionally, demonstrates by example.\n\n### b. Check Server Settings & Documentation\n\n- **llama-server** (or the backend you use): Check if it expects the system message as a special field, or as part of the conversation history.\n- Some servers require you to wrap the system message in a JSON object like:\n  ```json\n  [\n    {\"role\": \"system\", \"content\": \"Your detailed instructions...\"},\n    {\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"The user's question...\"}\n  ]\n  ```\n- Others only take a plain string.\n\n### c. Compare Input Formatting\n\n- Compare what llama-cli sends to the model vs. what the server receives. Are there extra tokens, separators, or JSON formatting?\n- Try mimicking llama-cli’s prompt format exactly when using the server.\n\n### d. Try Example Prompts\n\n- Use prompts like:\n  ```\n  You are a helpful assistant. Please answer the user’s question with detailed reasoning and a final answer. Use the following format:\n  <think> Reasoning process... </think>\n  <answer> Final answer... </answer>\n  ```\n\n### e. Experiment and Iterate\n\n- Tweak the system message and test outputs.\n- Save and compare outputs for different settings.\n\n---\n\n## 5. Summary Table\n\n| Tool         | System Message Needed? | Output Format Sensitivity | Notes |\n|--------------|-----------------------|--------------------------|-------|\n| llama-cli    | Can work with default | Lower                    | May add internal formatting |\n| llama-server | Needs explicit        | Higher                   | You control formatting, context, separators |\n\n---\n\n## 6. Troubleshooting Checklist\n\n- [ ] Are you sending the system message in the correct field/format?\n- [ ] Is your system message explicit about output structure?\n- [ ] Does your server expect a conversation array, or just a string?\n- [ ] Have you compared prompts sent by llama-cli vs. server?\n\n---\n\n## 7. If You Need More Help...\n\n- **Share exact commands or API calls** you’re using for both tools.\n- **Share example input/output** for both cases.\n- **Indicate which server implementation** you’re using (llamacpp-server, OpenAI API compatible, etc.).\n\nI can then help you with a more targeted fix!\n\n---\n\n**In summary:**  \nThe behavior you see is not a bug, but a difference in prompt handling and input expectations. With explicit, structured system prompts, you’ll get consistent, high-quality outputs—especially in server mode.\n\nIf you share more details, I can help you craft the exact prompt or API call you need!",

          "response": "It can be confusing because “system prompts” work a bit differently depending on how they’re passed into the model (and on which tool you’re using). Here are some suggestions and checks that may help you narrow down the issue:\n\n1) Verify how llama‑server injects or ignores system prompts.  \n   • Some servers will treat “system” messages differently—even ignoring them outright if not configured.  \n   • Others always prepend a default system prompt behind the scenes.  \n\n2) Confirm the prompt template.  \n   • llama‑cli (or llama.cpp) often uses a specific prompt template by default: for instance, it might automatically prepend lines like “### Instruction:” or “You are a helpful assistant.” before your user prompt.  \n   • If llama‑server does not do this, or if it has a different default template, then a bare “system” message might look like nonsense to the model. Ensuring that you replicate the same prompt template on the server side can help.  \n\n3) Use the same model and the same generation parameters.  \n   • Double-check that llama‑server loads the exact same model and uses the same hyperparameters (temperature, top_k, top_p, etc.) as llama‑cli. Differences in these parameters can lead to very different outputs.  \n\n4) Try explicitly including role tags or an instruction format in your system message.  \n   • Some frontends or wrappers expect the system prompt to include text like “<|SYSTEM|>” or to follow a certain format.  \n   • If you notice that your expanded system prompt (with <think> and <answer> tags) works reliably, that might mean the server requires a clearly framed structure in the text. You can replicate that style if it consistently produces desired results.  \n\n5) Look at logs or debugging output (if available).  \n   • If llama‑server has a debug mode, you might see how it’s assembling the final prompt before sending it to the model. That can help you confirm whether your system prompt is actually being included as you expect.  \n\n6) Compare an example of what is passed to the model.  \n   • Run the same user query in llama‑cli and llama‑server. Make sure you capture the full text that each tool constructs for the model. If you can see a difference (e.g., llama‑cli might have an extra line with “You are an AI assistant” or an extra “instruction” token), then you’ll know what needs to be adjusted on the server side.  \n\nIn short: to replicate llama‑cli behavior with llama‑server, align both the system prompt usage (or prompt template) and the generation parameters. If your multi-line system prompt with “<think>…</think> <answer>…</answer>” tags is working, that hints that llama‑server simply needs a more explicit instruction format. Try placing all the same “assistant instructions” into the system field for the server—just as you’ve done for the prompt that is working—and see if that stabilizes the responses.\n\nI hope these steps provide some clarity—just systematically compare the prompts being assembled in each environment, confirm the model/hyperparameters match, and you should be well on the way to getting llama‑server to behave just like llama‑cli. If something still seems off, it’s often a question of double-checking the “default” or “system” prompt that one tool (llama‑cli) imposes automatically, whereas the other (llama‑server) might not. Good luck, and don’t hesitate to keep experimenting until you find the exact combination that works consistently!",

          "response": "It sounds like you’ve discovered that the output from your llama-server setup only meets your expectations when you provide a more detailed system message that—including the instructions for reasoning and answer formatting—explicitly guides the model’s behavior. In contrast, the simpler prompts (or leaving it empty) yield what you call “garbage” output.\n\nHere are a few points to consider that might explain what you’re experiencing:\n\n1. System Message Handling Differences:\n • With llama-cli, there might be some built-in defaults or preprocessing (or even a different way of “merging” the system prompt with the rest of the conversation) that allow even a minimal prompt (or a default prompt coming from the application) to work reasonably.\n • With llama-server, however, the “System Message” field in the settings acts as your explicit instruction to the model. If this field is empty or very short (“you are helpful assisant”), then the model isn’t given enough context and guidance for the desired output format and thorough reasoning.\n\n2. Importance of Detailed Instructions:\n • When you use a more explicit system message (for example, the one that tells the assistant to think about the reasoning process and format it using the <think>...</think> and <answer>...</answer> tags), you’re providing a clear behavioral blueprint. Without that, the model might not “know” that it needs to include those internal reasoning steps in the output.\n • This can be especially common with language models that are sensitive to the prompt’s wording—the explicit instructions “anchor” the desired output behavior.\n\n3. Default Behavior in llama-server:\n • In llama-server, if you leave the system message empty, it might not automatically fill in a default prompt like you see in other environments (like llama-cli). Instead, it might rely solely on what your conversation provides.\n • Consequently, if the default system prompt behavior in llama-cli isn’t replicated by llama-server, you’d need to manually specify the desired instructions in the server’s system message field to achieve the output you want.\n\n4. Recommendations Going Forward:\n • If you want consistent behavior, incorporating a detailed system message (like the one with the reasoning and answer tags) into your llama-server settings seems necessary.\n • Double-check that there are no typos (for instance, “assisant” should be “assistant”) because even small errors in the prompt can sometimes impact model performance.\n • Consider reviewing the llama-server documentation or configuration files to see if there’s an option to provide a fallback default system message. Some servers allow you to specify a default that can be used when the field is empty.\n\nIn summary, it appears that with llama-server, you cannot rely on the same default system prompt behavior as with llama-cli. To achieve desirable results, you’ll need to explicitly set a detailed system message. This isn’t necessarily a bug—it’s more a difference in how the two interfaces or configurations handle the system message.\n\nI hope this helps you progress and feel a little less lost.

The behavior you're describing is quite interesting and worth investigating further.\n\nFrom your observations, it appears that when the system message is set to \"you are helpful assisant\" or left empty, the output is not what you expect. However, when the system message is set to a more detailed prompt, the output is correct.\n\nThis suggests that the way the LLaMA server interprets and uses the system message may be different from the way the llama-cli tool does. The system message is an important part of the prompt that can significantly influence the model's behavior and the quality of the responses.\n\nHere are a few things you can try to troubleshoot this issue:\n\n1. **Check the LLaMA server documentation**: Ensure that you're using the latest version of the LLaMA server and review the documentation for any guidance on the system message setting. The documentation may provide more information on how the server expects the system message to be formatted.\n\n2. **Experiment with different system message formats**: Try different variations of the system message, including different levels of detail, formatting, and tone. See if you can find a sweet spot where the server produces the desired output.\n\n3. **Compare the behavior with llama-cli**: As you mentioned, the llama-cli tool seems to handle the system message differently. Try running the same prompts with the llama-cli tool and compare the results. This may help you understand the differences in how the server and the CLI tool interpret the system message.\n\n4. **Check for any server-specific configuration options**: The LLaMA server may have additional configuration options or settings that can affect how the system message is used. Explore the server's documentation or configuration files to see if there are any relevant options you can adjust.\n\n5. **Reach out to the LLaMA server maintainers**: If you're still unable to resolve the issue, consider reaching out to the LLaMA server maintainers or the broader LLaMA community for guidance. They may be able to provide more insights into the expected behavior and any known issues with the system message setting.\n\nBy investigating this further and trying different approaches, you should be able to find a solution that works for your use case.

In llama-server, the system message field requires specific formatting with tags to work properly\n2. Simple prompts like \"you are helpful assistant\" aren't being processed correctly\n3.

Continue using the working system prompt with the tags since you've confirmed it works\n2. Check if there's a configuration option in llama-server to specify the chat template format\n3. Try adding format indicators like \"system:\", \"user:\", etc. before messages if you want to use simpler prompts\n\nThis is likely a matter of how the different interfaces format prompts for the underlying model.

Here's why:\n\n1. **Default behavior difference**: llama-cli often has built-in prompt formatting and context handling that llama-server doesn't automatically apply\n2. **Template formatting**: llama-server may not be applying the correct chat template formatting to your system message\n3. **Context initialization**: The server might need more explicit instructions about how to behave\n\n## Solutions to Try\n\n### 1. **Use a More Detailed System Prompt** (You've found this works!)\nYour working prompt is good because it:\n- Gives clear structure with the `<think>` and `<answer>` tags\n- Provides explicit instructions on reasoning process\n- Gives the model a clear format to follow\n\n### 2. **Try These Alternative System Prompts**\n```\nYou are a helpful AI assistant. Always provide clear, accurate, and well-reasoned responses to user questions.\n```\n\nOr:\n```\nYou are an AI assistant. Respond helpfully and accurately to the user's questions. Think through your response carefully before answering.\n```\n\n### 3. **Check Server Configuration**\nAdd these parameters to your llama-server command:\n```bash\n--chat-template auto\n--system-prompt-file system.txt\n```\n\n### 4. **Model-Specific Templates**\nSome models need specific formatting. Try:\n```\n<|system|>\nYou are a helpful assistant.\n<|end|>\n```\n\n## Why This Happens\n\n- **llama-cli** often automatically applies appropriate chat templates and formatting\n- **llama-server** gives you more raw control but requires more explicit configuration\n- Different models expect different prompt formats, and the server doesn't always auto-detect this\n\nYour detailed system prompt works because it gives the model clear structure and expectations.

To answer the user's question, you first think about the reasoning process and then provide the user with the answer. The reasoning process and answer are enclosed within <think> </think> and <answer> </answer> tags, respectively, i.e., <think> reasoning process here </think> <answer> answer here </answer>.\n\nThis gives the model both a role **and** a formatting instruction, making outputs structured and intelligible.\n\n### Why doesn’t the default (empty or minimal) prompt work in llama-server?\n\n- **llama-server** may not inject any default role or formatting instructions if the field is left blank or is too generic (like “you are helpful assistant”), so the model lacks context for how to behave.\n- **llama-cli**, on the other hand, might inject a default system prompt behind the scenes—hence why it works even with no explicit system message.\n\n### Conclusion\n\n> **Yes, you can use the default system prompt with llama-cli, but not with llama-server unless you provide an explicit and detailed system message.**\n\n### Recommendation\n\nIf you want llama-server to behave like llama-cli, always provide a comprehensive system prompt in the server settings. For example:\n\n```\nYou are a helpful assistant. To answer the user's question, you first think about the reasoning process and then provide the user with the answer. The reasoning process and answer are enclosed within <think> </think> and <answer> </answer> tags, respectively, i.e., <think> reasoning process here </think> <answer> answer here </answer>.\n```\n\n#### Tip\n- If you want to mimic llama-cli exactly, you could check its source code or documentation to see what system prompt it uses by default, and set that in your llama-server configuration.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nllama-server does not inject a default system prompt, so you must specify one for good results. llama-cli likely uses a built-in default.

Using a short system message like “you are helpful assisant” or leaving it empty causes the output to be “garbage” (or not what you’re expecting).\n\nHere’s a bit more detail on what might be happening:\n\n1. In llama-cli, there may be a built‐in default system prompt (or some default logic) that drives the generation in a controlled way even if you don’t provide one explicitly. This can “correct” the output to some degree.\n\n2. In llama-server, however, the system message is taken from that edit field directly. If it’s empty or not detailed enough, the underlying model won’t have the proper guidance or formatting instructions. That missing guidance (or mis-typing the prompt such as “assisant” instead of “assistant”) leads to output that isn’t structured as you planned.\n\n3. When you specify a detailed system message including the exact reasoning and formatting (with <think> … </think> and <answer> … </answer> tags), you’re effectively “instructing” the model how to think and answer.

Establishes the assistant role clearly\n2. Provides explicit formatting instructions (`<think>` and `<answer>` tags)\n3. Gives the model a clear structure to follow\n\n## Solutions\n\n### Option 1: Use a More Complete Default System Message\nInstead of just \"you are helpful assistant\", try:\n```\nYou are a helpful AI assistant. Please provide clear, accurate, and helpful responses to user questions.\n```\n\n### Option 2: Check Your Model's Expected Format\nDifferent models expect different system message formats. For Llama models, try:\n```\n<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nYou are a helpful AI assistant.<|eot_id|>\n```\n\n### Option 3: Server Configuration\nCheck if your llama-server has these parameters set:\n- `--chat-template` (to ensure proper conversation formatting)\n- `--system-prompt-file` (for a default system prompt file)\n\n### Option 4: API-Level System Message\nIf using the API, ensure you're sending the system message in the correct format in your request body.\n\nThe key difference is that llama-server requires more explicit instruction about formatting and behavior, while llama-cli has these built-in defaults.",

Let me clarify the situation for you:\n\n**What's Going On:**\n\n- **llama-cli**: When you use the default system prompt (or leave it empty), the model still works well and gives you usable output.\n- **llama-server**: When you use the same default/empty system prompt, the output is not helpful (\"garbage\"). But when you provide a very explicit system prompt with instructions about <think></think> and <answer></answer> tags, it works well.\n\n**Why This Happens:**\n\nThis difference is likely due to how llama-server handles system prompts compared to llama-cli:\n\n1. **Prompt Format Differences**:  \n   - **llama-cli** might automatically format the prompt in a way the model expects, even if you leave the system prompt empty.\n   - **llama-server** might require a more explicit system prompt to structure the conversation, especially if it's configured to expect certain tags or instruction-following behavior.\n\n2. **Instruction-following Models**:  \n   Many LLMs, including Llama-based ones, perform much better when given clear, explicit instructions in the system prompt. The explicit example you gave tells the model *exactly* how to format its response, leading to more reliable output.\n\n3. **Server-specific Defaults**:  \n   llama-server might not add a helpful default system prompt if you leave it empty, or it might format the prompt differently than the CLI tool.\n\n**What to Do:**\n\n- **Always provide an explicit system prompt** in llama-server, especially if you want structured output. Your longer, explicit prompt is a good pattern to follow.\n- If you want llama-server to behave like llama-cli, check if there is a configuration option in llama-server for the default system prompt. You might be able to copy the CLI's default system prompt into the server settings.\n- If you're developing your own integrations, you could also write a wrapper that automatically adds your preferred system prompt when none is specified.\n\n**Summary Table:**\n\n| Tool          | System Prompt           | Output         |\n|---------------|------------------------|----------------|\n| llama-cli     | default/empty          | Works well     |\n| llama-server  | default/empty          | Garbage        |\n| llama-server  | explicit instructions  | Works well     |\n\n**Recommendation:**  \nUse the explicit system prompt with llama-server, or try to match the CLI's prompt formatting.

          "response": "It sounds like llama-server and llama-cli are handling the system prompt slightly differently, which can cause inconsistent outputs based on how your prompt is structured. A few possible reasons for this discrepancy:\n\n1. Prompt formatting differences.  \n   The CLI might be adding additional prompt strings (such as “### User:” and “### Assistant:”) or handling the system prompt in a special way. Meanwhile, llama-server might be passing your system prompt verbatim (with no additional formatting).\n\n2. Model or server defaults.  \n   llama-cli might automatically include a standardized system preset (“You are a helpful assistant…”) whether or not you explicitly set one. On the other hand, llama-server could be using an empty or minimal system prompt if you do not explicitly provide one—leading to the “garbage” outputs.\n\n3. Tag-based instructions are helping the model.  \n   When the system message says “use <think> for reasoning and <answer> for the final text,” it’s effectively telling the model to produce structured reasoning followed by a concise answer. If you remove these instructions, the model is more prone to producing less-focused text. The fact that it “works correctly” once you include the <think> and <answer> instructions indicates the model is relying heavily on those guidelines.\n\n4. Differences in how you supply the system message to llama-server.  \n   Double-check that the system prompt is actually being passed to the model. In some setups, if the system prompt is empty, llama-server may skip it altogether—thus removing important context.\n\nPossible ways to fix or ensure consistent behavior:\n\n• Make sure you provide the same system-prompt text to both llama-cli and llama-server. If one approach includes a system prompt while the other does not, you’ll get mismatched behavior.\n\n• If you want to replicate the behavior where “it works correctly,” keep the exact same system message that includes <think> and <answer> tags (including the same wording about how to use them).\n\n• If you need to use an abbreviated system message (e.g., “You are a helpful assistant”), try explicitly adding any necessary role markers or instructions so that llama-server does not strip or mishandle them.\n\n• If your llama-server configuration file (or the launch command) has a separate field for “system messages” versus “user messages” or “assistant messages,” be sure you’re populating each in the correct place—particularly the “system” or “instruction” message that the model sees first.\n\nIn summary, yes, you can use the “default” system prompt from llama-cli in llama-server, but you may need to replicate or explicitly define the same prompt structure in llama-server. Be sure that llama-server is receiving the same instructions (including your <think> / <answer> tags if needed), and verify how the server is handling empty or minimal system prompts. If the system prompt is not being inserted as you expect, that can definitely produce the “garbage” you’re seeing.",

          "response": "It sounds like you’ve encountered an inconsistency between how llama-cli and llama-server handle the system prompt. Based on your description, when you use a simple or empty system prompt on llama-server, the generated output is poor (“garbage”), but if you supply a detailed prompt that not only identifies the assistant’s role but also instructs it first to reason (using the <think> … </think> tags) and then provide an answer (using the <answer> … </answer> tags), things work as expected.\n\nHere are a few points to consider:\n\n1. Differences in Default Behavior:  \n • With llama-cli, there may be an internal or hard-coded default system prompt or other context that “kicks in” when you leave it empty or use a simple prompt.  \n • With llama-server, the system message field directly controls the context that’s prepended to your conversation. If you provide an empty or overly minimal prompt, the server may not be giving the model enough guidance, resulting in “garbage” output.\n\n2. The Role of Detailed Instructions:  \n • Your detailed prompt not only states “You are a helpful assistant” but also outlines the exact format (chain-of-thought tags) to follow before answering. This extra structure seems to stabilize the output on llama-server.  \n • When you use only “you are helpful assisant” (with a typo) or leave it empty, the model might be missing that extra cue that triggers a robust reasoning process.\n\n3. What This Means for Your Use Case:  \n • In your current setup, it appears that you can rely on the more “default” behavior in llama-cli (probably because of an internal safety net or default prompt) while llama-server requires you to explicitly set a detailed system message to maintain output quality.  \n • This isn’t necessarily a bug in llama-server but likely a difference in how the two platforms manage the system context. llama-server may not have the automatic fallback that the cli tool might be using.\n\n4. How to Proceed:  \n • Until there’s an update or configuration option that aligns the behavior between the server and the cli, you’ll need to supply a sufficiently detailed system prompt on llama-server—like the one with the <think> and <answer> tags—to get good results.  \n • You might also want to check if there’s any documentation or release notes for llama-server that address how the system prompt is supposed to behave. Sometimes there’s a configuration option that lets you specify a “default” prompt if the field is empty.\n\nSo, to answer your question directly: Yes, in your current experience it seems that you can use the default (or minimal) system prompt with llama-cli successfully but not with llama-server. On the server side you have to supply a more detailed prompt that directs both the reasoning process and output formatting.\n\nIf you believe this behavior might be a misconfiguration or a bug, you may want to consult the llama-server documentation or reach out to the maintainers for further clarification.",

          "response": "It appears you've stumbled on a subtle but important detail regarding prompts when using llama-server versus llama-cli.\n\n**What's likely happening:**\n\n- **System Message Usage:**  \n  The llama-server, unlike llama-cli, expects a more explicit and structured system prompt to guide the model effectively. A general or empty system message may cause ambiguous or nonspecific behavior from the model, resulting in poor-quality outputs or \"garbage.\"\n\n- **Prompt structure matters:**  \n  You've discovered that a detailed, structured instruction (with explicit reasoning and tagging instructions) significantly improves the quality and consistency of the model output. This implies your particular model might have been fine-tuned or trained specifically to respond well to structured prompts with explicit formatting instructions.\n\n- **Differences in llama-cli vs llama-server:**  \n  llama-cli typically provides a simple, \"raw\" interaction where default system prompts and formatting might implicitly exist or be handled differently (or internally hardcoded). llama-server, on the other hand, often requires explicit specification of a detailed system prompt to clearly instruct the model how to format and structure its responses.\n\n**Recommended action:**  \nContinue using the explicit, structured prompt you've discovered to work well. For example, the prompt you found effective:\n\n```\nYou are a helpful assistant. To answer the user's question, you first think about the reasoning process and then provide the user with the answer. The reasoning process and answer are enclosed within <think> </think> and <answer> </answer> tags, respectively, i.e., <think> reasoning process here </think> <answer> answer here </answer>.\n```\n\nThis clearly instructs the model on precisely how you expect it to format responses, thus improving overall output quality.\n\n**Why default prompts might fail on llama-server:**  \n- llama-server typically does not provide a built-in default prompt. It expects you to explicitly define it.  \n- A vague or empty prompt leads the model to generate outputs without a clear directive, resulting in lower quality.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nYes, you generally need a clear and explicit system prompt when working with llama-server. The difference you observed is normal behavior, and your solution (explicitly defining the structured prompt) is exactly correct.\n\n**Suggested next steps:**  \n- Always explicitly specify a detailed system prompt in llama-server.  \n- Consider saving preferred prompts for reuse, ensuring consistency and reliability in your llama-server workflows.",

If the field is blank or disabled, it may simply ignore it.  \n   • Check what happens in the code or config for llama-server: does it explicitly insert your system prompt, or does it skip it unless it is non-empty?\n\n2) Compare the default prompts:\n   • If llama-cli has a built-in default system prompt (for instance, “You are a helpful assistant…”), but llama-server simply omits the system prompt if you leave it empty, that might explain the difference in output quality.\n   • Confirm whether llama-cli prepends extra instructions to the model behind the scenes.\n\n3) Try using a more elaborate system message in llama-server:\n   • If “you are a helpful assistant” and empty both produce low-quality output in llama-server, you might try a more descriptive version (like you mentioned, the one that encloses reasoning and answer in tags) to see if that improves coherence.\n   • Some models respond better when the system message provides a more detailed role and style guideline.\n\n4) Check for any front-end or UI constraints:\n   • If you are using a web interface or a separate management console, ensure that system messages are actually being sent in the request to the model. Sometimes, an empty field prevents the system message from being sent at all.\n\nIn short, yes—if llama-cli applies a default instruction while llama-server doesn’t, you may see different outputs unless you explicitly supply a longer or clearer system message in llama-server. The key is to ensure the system prompt is actually sent to the model and that it provides enough detail to guide the model’s behavior.",

With the CLI, a default or very minimal system prompt (e.g., \"You are a helpful assistant\") typically works fine, because the CLI internally prepares the prompt in a structured format (often adding explicit instructions, formatting, or chat templates).\n\nHowever, Llama-server usually provides direct access to the raw model endpoint without implicitly structuring your prompts. A minimal or empty system prompt, when used via Llama-server, often leads the model to lose context or produce incoherent outputs (\"garbage\"), because the model isn't explicitly told how to format its response, and it doesn't implicitly assume a structured assistant role.\n\nWhen you explicitly provide a structured prompt (such as the detailed instruction with `<think>` and `<answer>` tags), the model knows exactly what you expect, and thus produces well-formatted, coherent outputs.\n\nTo summarize clearly:\n\n- **Llama-cli**:  \n  Usually applies default internal formatting, so a minimal prompt (\"You are helpful assistant\") works fine out-of-the-box.\n\n- **Llama-server**:  \n  Typically exposes a raw endpoint. If you provide a minimal or empty system message, the model is unsure how it should structure the response, resulting in poor quality outputs.\n\n**How to fix:**  \nIf you want to use llama-server with a minimal or default prompt, you must explicitly provide a structured template or clear instructions in the system message. The prompt you found working correctly (with `<think>` and `<answer>` tags) is exactly the kind of structured template that llama-server needs to produce reliable outputs.\n\nThus, your observations are correct:  \n- Minimal or default system prompts (\"you are helpful assistant\") are usually insufficient for llama-server.  \n- Explicit and structured instructions (like the one you provided) are necessary for llama-server to produce consistent and coherent results.\n\n**Recommended approach:**  \nAlways provide a detailed and structured system prompt when working directly with llama-server, such as the one you've used successfully:\n\n```\nYou are a helpful assistant.

Alternative: Use API with Proper Formatting\nWhen using the API, make sure to include the system message in your requests:\n```json\n{\n  \"messages\": [\n    {\n      \"role\": \"system\",\n      \"content\": \"You are a helpful assistant. To answer the user's question, you first think about the reasoning process and then provide the user with the answer.

In your experiments, only when you explicitly provide a system prompt with the chain-of-thought instructions does the output come out as expected.\n\nHere’s what might be happening and some steps to consider:\n\n1. Default Behavior Differences:\n • It appears that the llama-cli version has an internal default system message (or a built-in mechanism) that activates if nothing is provided. On the other hand, the llama-server simply won’t use any default if the field is empty.\n • This difference in behavior means that on llama-server you must supply an explicit system prompt if you need the generation to follow a certain structure (in your case, providing both the chain-of-thought reasoning and the final answer inside dedicated tags).\n\n2. The Impact on Output:\n • When you provided a very minimal system message like “you are helpful assisant” or left it empty, the context (and the expectation for the chain-of-thought structure) wasn’t set up. That likely resulted in “garbage” output because the model wasn’t given clear guidance on how to structure its reasoning.\n • With the longer instruction that tells the model exactly where and how to include the reasoning process (<think> … </think>) and the answer (<answer> … </answer>), the output improves noticeably.\n\n3. What You Can Do:\n • If your workflow relies on a default system prompt that includes instructions for chain-of-thought, then with llama-server you’ll have to include that explicitly in the system message field.\n • Review the llama-server documentation or settings. There might be a configuration option to enable a fallback prompt. If not, consider always seeding the server with your full prompt instruction.\n • Double-check for any version differences or known issues in the llama-server release notes or community forums. It could be a recognized behavior with a planned fix or workaround.\n\nWhile it might be inconvenient (especially if you’re trying to maintain consistency with llama-cli), the safest path right now with llama-server is to explicitly use the system prompt that fully lays out your expectations.\n\nIn summary: Yes—it does seem that you can rely on a default system prompt with llama-cli, but with llama-server you’ll need to provide that system prompt explicitly if you want proper formatting and output.",

          "response": "Great observations! Here’s what’s likely happening based on your description:\n\n### 1. System Message and Output Formatting\nYour LLM (Large Language Model) deployment is sensitive to the content of the system prompt (system message). The system message acts as an “instruction” or “role definition” for the model. When you provide a detailed system message (like the one with <think> and <answer> tags), the model knows how to structure its output.\n\nWhen the system message is:\n- **\"you are helpful assistant\"** (typo, missing \"a\")  \n  The model receives little structure, so its output is unpredictable (\"garbage\").\n- **Empty**  \n  The model has no role/instruction, so again, unpredictable output.\n- **Detailed instruction with tags**  \n  The model produces the desired, structured output.\n\n### 2. llama-cli vs. llama-server System Prompt Behavior\n\n- **llama-cli**:  \n  This CLI tool likely has its own default system message if you don’t provide one, which may be more elaborate or “safe” than you realize (e.g., “You are a helpful assistant.” or more). That’s why you get good output even with the default.\n- **llama-server**:  \n  The server may be passing the system message exactly as you specify, with no fallback default. If it's empty or too simple, the model outputs \"garbage\".\n\n### 3. Likely Solution\n- **Check the default system prompt for each tool**. If llama-cli has a good default but llama-server doesn’t, you’ll need to explicitly set a detailed system prompt in llama-server.\n- **Always specify a detailed system message** for llama-server, especially if you want structured output or special behavior (like the <think> and <answer> tags).\n\n### 4. Why is this necessary?\nModels like Llama 2/3 are very sensitive to initial instructions. Without enough context or instruction, their output can degrade significantly.\n\n### 5. What should you do?\n**Yes, use a detailed system message in llama-server**. If you want to replicate llama-cli’s behavior, try extracting the default system message from llama-cli (check its code or documentation), and set that as your system message in llama-server.\n\n**Example system message for good, structured output:**\n```plaintext\nYou are a helpful assistant. To answer the user's question, you first think about the reasoning process and then provide the user with the answer. The reasoning process and answer are enclosed within <think> </think> and <answer> </answer> tags, respectively, i.e., <think> reasoning process here </think> <answer> answer here </answer>.\n```\n\n**Summary:**  \n- llama-cli and llama-server may have different default system prompts.\n- Always set a clear, structured system prompt in llama-server for best results.\n\nIf you want to check what llama-cli's default system prompt is, try running it in verbose or debug mode, or check the source code/documentation.\n\n**Let me know if you want help crafting a system message or troubleshooting further!**",

          "response": "It sounds like the key difference is that llama‑cli and llama‑server handle system prompts differently, and llama‑server may not be adding any “default” prompt behind the scenes. In other words, when you leave the system prompt empty or too short, llama‑server doesn’t fill in the gap with a helpful boilerplate—so the model ends up generating incoherent output. Meanwhile, llama‑cli might be injecting some default instructions (or using different settings) so that even a short or empty system message still produces somewhat coherent text.\n\nBelow are a few steps and considerations that can help:\n\n1) Compare actual prompts being sent.\n   • When you run llama‑cli, enable verbose or debug logs (if supported) to see the final prompt that is passed into the model, including any system or role instructions.  \n   • Do the same in llama‑server (if there’s a way to turn on debug logs), so you can confirm exactly what final input the model is receiving.\n\n2) Manually replicate the llama‑cli default prompt in llama‑server.\n   • If you see that llama‑cli includes a hidden system or role message (e.g. “You are a helpful AI assistant…”), try copying that verbatim into the “System Message” field in llama‑server.  \n   • Make sure this prompt is nonempty and provides enough structure—some models need clear instructions to produce well-structured output.\n\n3) Adjust the system message for a known good format.  \n   • If the model responds well when you use the longer system message describing <think> and <answer> tags, you can continue using that.  \n   • Some models (particularly those that are fine-tuned for chat) behave better with more explicit role or style instructions; so a detailed system prompt can reduce “garbage” output.\n\n4) Check llama‑server configuration.  \n   • Some llama‑server forks or builds have an option like “disable_default_system_prompt” or “prepend_bos” that can change how the initial prompt is structured.  \n   • If you see a setting that disables system prompts entirely (or only uses your custom message if it isn’t empty), confirm you have that set properly.\n\nIn short, “yes”—it’s possible that llama‑cli supplies a default system prompt internally, while llama‑server does not. The best workaround is to explicitly provide the same system message you see working in llama‑cli (or a more elaborate version that reliably produces good output) and place it into llama‑server’s “System Message” field. That should get you consistent results between the two.",

In your tests, using a very plain system message (or none at all) leads to “garbage” output on the server, but when you include the full instruction with the <think> and <answer> tags, it works as expected.\n\nHere are a few points to consider:\n\n1. Differences in prompt handling:  \n   – In the CLI version the default system prompt might be hardcoded or preprocessed in a way that “fixes” or supplements a simple message like “you are helpful assistant.”  \n   – In llama-server, however, the system prompt is taken exactly as provided in its edit field. This means that if you leave it empty or if you provide a simpler string, the expected structured output (using <think> and <answer> tags) might not be enforced.\n\n2. Instruction specificity:  \n   – The detailed prompt that explicitly explains the chain-of-thought process forces the model to format its output in the expected way. Without these enforced instructions, the model might produce output that doesn’t match your expectations.\n\n3. Workarounds and configuration:  \n   – If your desired behavior (i.e., the structured output) is only obtained when you explicitly include the chain-of-thought instruction, then you’ll need to use that as the active system prompt for llama-server.  \n   – It could also hint that there’s a gap or bug in how llama-server handles default or empty system messages compared to llama-cli. Depending on the implementation, the server might not be “injecting” a fallback prompt like the CLI does.\n\nSo, to answer your question directly:  \nYes, it appears that the defaults you’re accustomed to with llama-cli aren’t being applied by llama-server. To get consistent and well-structured output on the server, you must provide the full explicit system prompt (with the chain-of-thought and output tag instructions). \n\nIf this behavior is unintended or if you believe it could be improved, you might consider raising an issue with the maintainers of llama-server or looking for configuration options/documentation that detail the differences in how system prompts are applied between the two interfaces.",

          "response": "Your observation indicates the importance of explicitly defining a structured system prompt when interacting with Llama models via llama-server. Let me explain clearly what's happening and how to achieve your desired behavior:\n\n### Understanding the Issue:\n\n- **System Message in llama-server**:  \n  When using llama-server, the \"System Message\" in the server settings influences how your queries are processed.  \n  - If the system message is too short, generic, or empty, the model might not understand the expected format or instructions clearly, resulting in unclear or incorrect (\"garbage\") outputs.\n  - When using a structured, detailed prompt (such as the third example you provided), the model clearly understands the task, resulting in correct outputs.\n\n- **Llama-cli vs. Llama-server**:  \n  With llama-cli commands, you typically pass an explicit prompt directly and clearly defined format inline, so the model behaves correctly.  \n  However, llama-server may rely heavily on an explicit, detailed system prompt to correctly guide the model, especially when using structured output formats (like tags `<think>` and `<answer>`).\n\n### Why Does the Detailed Prompt Work?\n\nThe detailed prompt you used:\n\n```\nYou are a helpful assistant. To answer the user's question, you first think about the reasoning process and then provide the user with the answer. The reasoning process and answer are enclosed within <think> </think> and <answer> </answer> tags, respectively, i.e., <think> reasoning process here </think> <answer> answer here </answer>.\n```\n\nThis prompt clearly instructs the model on how to structure its response, ensuring it follows the required reasoning and tagging format. Without explicit instructions, the model will likely default to unstructured or incoherent output.\n\n### Recommended Solution:\n\nIf you want consistent, structured behavior from llama-server, you **must** explicitly set a detailed and structured system prompt. A good practice is:\n\n1. Always use a clearly articulated system prompt.\n2. Include explicit instructions and examples on how responses should be structured.\n3. Ensure this structured prompt is consistently applied in the server settings, rather than leaving it blank or too generic.\n\n### Example Recommended System Prompt:\n\n```\nYou are a helpful assistant. Carefully follow these instructions:\n\n- First, carefully reason step-by-step about the user's input. Clearly detail your reasoning process inside <think> tags.\n- Then, provide a concise, correct, and helpful answer to the user's query inside <answer> tags.\n\nExample format:\n<think>\nHere you carefully explain your reasoning step-by-step.\n</think>\n<answer>\nHere you provide the concise and accurate final answer.\n</answer>\n```\n\nPlacing this explicit prompt into the llama-server system message ensures consistent, accurate, and structured responses.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nYes, your observation is correct: llama-server requires explicit, detailed system prompts for structured outputs. Unlike llama-cli (which often implicitly defines structure by passing prompts inline), llama-server depends heavily on the explicit \"System Message\" you provide via server settings.\n\n**In short**:  \n- Always set a detailed, structured \"System Message\" when using llama-server.  \n- Your third prompt is a good example—keep using something similar to ensure proper structured outputs.\n\nThis will resolve the issue you've encountered and ensure consistent, accurate llama-server responses.",

This could be due to a few possible reasons:\n\n1. **Formatting Differences**: The formatting of the system message might be causing issues when used with the `llama-server`. The successful system message includes specific tags (`<think>`, `</think>`, `<answer>`, `</answer>`), which might be interpreted differently by the server implementation.\n\n2. **Server Configuration**: The `llama-server` might have additional configuration or settings that are not being properly applied or recognized when using the system message.

Ensure that the system message is properly formatted and encoded, without any hidden or unexpected characters.\n\nTo troubleshoot this issue, you can try the following:\n\n1. **Verify the System Message Format**: Ensure that the system message you're using with the `llama-server` is exactly the same as the one that works with the `llama-cli`. Double-check the formatting, including the presence and placement of the `<think>`, `</think>`, `<answer>`, and `</answer>` tags.\n\n2. **Check the Server Logs**: Examine the server logs for any error messages or clues that might indicate why the system message is not working as expected. This could help identify the specific issue or configuration problem.\n\n3. **Try Different System Message Formats**: Experiment with different variations of the system message, such as removing the tags, using different formatting, or trying a more simplified version, to see if you can find a combination that works with the `llama-server`.\n\n4. **Verify Server Configuration**: Ensure that the `llama-server` is properly configured and that there are no other settings or options that might be interfering with the system message functionality.\n\nIf you continue to experience issues, you may need to reach out to the LLaMA project maintainers or the community for further assistance in resolving the discrepancy between the `llama-cli` and `llama-server` behavior.",

          "response": "Great question! Let’s break down what’s happening and why, focusing on **llama-cli** vs **llama-server** and \"system message\" handling.\n\n## 1. How System Messages Work\n\nThe **system message** is a prompt prepended to each user request, steering the model’s behavior. It's crucial for aligning the model's responses with your expectations.\n\n- **Generic system messages** (e.g., \"You are a helpful assistant.\") often work well in consumer chatbots because they've been tuned on such prompts.\n- **Specialized system messages** (e.g., instructing the model to use custom tags like `<think>` and `<answer>`) are needed if your downstream application parses or expects responses in a specific format.\n\n## 2. llama-cli vs llama-server\n\n### llama-cli\n\n- **llama-cli** typically just sends your prompt (optionally with a system message) to the model and returns the raw output.\n- It tends to work well with the default \"You are a helpful assistant.\" prompt because it mirrors how the models were originally trained (instruct/friendly assistant).\n\n### llama-server\n\n- **llama-server** is often used to serve the model over an API, for integration with web UIs or other apps.\n- It may have stricter requirements for output formatting if your application expects responses in a set structure (like using `<think>` and `<answer>` tags).\n- If the system prompt is empty or generic, the model doesn't know to use your custom tags, so it outputs \"garbage\" (i.e., plain text, not the expected format).\n- When you specify the detailed system prompt (\"...enclose within <think>...</think> and <answer>...</answer>...\"), it works, because now the model is forced to respond in that format.\n\n## 3. Why the Difference?\n\n- **llama-cli** works with the default prompt because it just expects general assistant behavior and you (or your script) don't care about output formatting.\n- **llama-server**, especially if you're using a UI or downstream parser that **expects a specific output format**, *requires* a system prompt that tells the model to use that format.\n\nIf you don't specify this, the UI/parser might not be able to extract the answer, leading to \"garbage\" output (from its perspective).\n\n## 4. Recommendations\n\n- If your server/client expects structured output (e.g., for parsing, automation, or UI display), **always specify a detailed system prompt** telling the model exactly how to format its response.\n- If you're just chatting in the CLI, a generic system prompt is fine.\n\n### Expert Opinion\n\nThe difference arises from **how your downstream application interprets the model output**. It's not a bug in either llama-cli or llama-server, but rather the expectations of your application or UI.\n\n- **llama-cli** is flexible and works with defaults because it's just for \"raw\" chat.\n- **llama-server** is often part of a bigger system where output *structure* matters. Thus, a detailed system prompt is essential.\n\n**In summary:**  \nUse a detailed system prompt whenever your application *expects* structured output. This applies regardless of whether you're using llama-cli or llama-server, but is especially important with llama-server and any UI or tool that parses responses.\n\nIf you need to use the same prompt everywhere, standardize on the detailed one with tags.\n\n---\n\n**TL;DR:**  \nllama-cli lets you use default prompts because it doesn't care about format. llama-server (and its clients) may require specific output structure, so you must give the model an explicit system prompt instructing it how to format its answers.\n\nIf you need further help tweaking prompts or understanding model behavior, let me know your specific use case and how you're consuming the output!",

          "response": "It sounds like the main issue here is that llama-server (as opposed to llama-cli) is either not injecting the system message in the same way or is applying it inconsistently. This can happen for a few reasons:\n\n1. How the prompt context is built:  \n   • Different tools treat “system messages” differently. llama-cli may prepend a system message automatically in one format, whereas llama-server may use a separate mechanism (for example, different tokens or different roles) to pass system instructions to the model.  \n   • If llama-server is not actually sending the full system prompt to the model, the model ends up with either an unexpected or empty instruction context.  \n\n2. The model’s sensitivity to instructions:  \n   • Models tuned on instructional data (like “You are a helpful assistant…”) can sometimes behave unpredictably (i.e., produce less coherent answers) without receiving instructions in a format or style they were trained on.  \n   • If your system message is just a short, generic statement (like “you are a helpful assistant”) or is left empty, the model might not receive enough guidance.  \n\n3. The role of the chain-of-thought style:  \n   • Your longer message—saying “You are a helpful assistant. To answer the user’s question, you first think about the reasoning process… <think> … </think> <answer> … </answer>”—gives the model a structured format. Some models respond strongly to explicit instructions on how to format the output, especially if they were finetuned or taught to respond in that style.  \n   • If llama-server is ignoring or truncating that structure, you’ll see a less coherent result.  \n\n4. Potential configuration differences:  \n   • There may be a configuration mismatch in llama-server defaults—like a “system prompt” field that must be explicitly set, or a token length/stop sequence limitation that cuts off essential instructions.  \n   • It is also possible that llama-server is applying a secondary “system message” or a template that overwrites or conflicts with what you provide, which can lead to confusion in the final output.  \n\nShort answer:  \n• Try verifying that llama-server is actually forwarding your entire system prompt to the model.  \n• Make sure that no other prompts or templates are interfering.  \n• If possible, replicate the same prompt formatting you’re using with llama-cli in llama-server.  \n• Finally, be aware that some system prompts (short, generic statements) don’t do much in guiding the model, whereas structured instructions (the tags, chain-of-thought style, etc.) may strongly influence the output.  \n\nMost situations like this boil down to how the prompt is being assembled under the hood. Once you confirm that llama-server is passing your instructions in the same way llama-cli does, you should see similarly coherent output. If not, check for differences in how each system handles prompt roles, conversation history, or tokens.",

          "response": "There are a few factors that might explain the behavior you’re seeing. In many custom Llama interfaces (and even in other open‑source or fine‑tuned models), the exact text of the system prompt heavily influences both the visible output and how (or whether) intermediate reasoning is produced or hidden. Here are some points to consider:\n\n1. Default vs. “Chain‑of‑Thought” Instructions\n\n • When you only use a vague system message like “you are helpful assistant” (or nothing at all), the model may perform internal reasoning (its “chain of thought”) without ever making it obvious in its output. In some configurations the hidden chain‑of‑thought remains private, and the final answer is produced directly—this may sometimes produce output that appears disorganized or “garbage” if the decoder isn’t perfectly aligned with what you expect.\n\n • By contrast, when you provide an explicit instruction that tells the model to include both its reasoning (enclosed in <think> … </think>) and its final answer (in <answer> … </answer> tags), you are effectively “forcing” it to externalize its chain of thought. This extra structure can cause the model to “think out loud” in a way that appears both consistent and easier to follow, which is why you see better behaved output.\n\n2. Differences Between Llama‑CLI and Llama‑Server\n\n • Llama‑CLI and Llama‑Server may be using slightly different initialization routines, tokenization settings, or even default prompts that affect how system messages are applied. For example, the CLI might come with some default hidden instructions or post‑processing steps that “clean up” the output, whereas the server version might simply pass along exactly what the model produces.\n  \n • The explicit chain‑of‑thought prompt you mentioned (with the <think> … </think> tags) works well because it gives the model clear instructions about the expected formatting. The result is that both versions of your setup (CLI and server) then “see” the same prompt and are more likely to behave consistently.\n\n3. Expert Opinion/Recommendation\n\n • If your goal is to have consistent and clear output (with both reasoning and answer made visible in a specific format), it’s best to embed these instructions explicitly into your system message. Relying on the “default” system prompt may work in some contexts (and perhaps in your CLI setup) but not in others (like your server), because the server’s configuration or the absence of extra instructions can lead the model to behave differently.\n  \n • In other words, it isn’t that one version “supports” the default system prompt and the other doesn’t—instead, the extra detail in your prompt acts as a guidepost for the model’s generation. If this level of guidance is omitted, especially in the server environment, you might see what you’re calling “garbage” (or simply unexpected output) simply because the model isn’t being steered toward the output format you desire.\n\nSo, while you may be able to use a “default” system prompt with llama‑CLI (if it, for instance, has some background logic or defaults built in), when running llama‑server you might need to be more explicit with your instructions. The best practice is to always provide a system message that precisely dictates the desired structure and output style—especially if you need the chain‑of‑thought details to be visible. \n\nIn summary, rather than thinking of it as “default system prompt works with llama‑CLI but not with llama‑server,” it’s more about explicitly instructing your model on its formatting and reasoning output to ensure consistent behavior across different deployment modes.",

          "response": "The behavior you are experiencing is expected and reflects how LLaMA-based models interpret and respond to prompts, especially via APIs or server interfaces.\n\nHere's what's happening in detail:\n\n### Why the output is \"garbage\" when using simpler system messages or no message at all:\n\n- **LLaMA models require clear instructions:**  \n  These models, especially the LLaMA family, generally do not come with built-in instruction-following capabilities by default. They rely heavily on explicit and structured prompts. If the instructions are too vague, minimal, or non-existent (such as \"you are helpful assistant\" or an empty message), the model will likely default to a continuation-style response, generating seemingly random or irrelevant text.\n\n- **Default prompt structure matters:**  \n  When you interact with these models via command-line interfaces (like llama-cli), the CLI usually wraps your input with a default prompt structure that is already optimized for instruction-following. On the other hand, when using llama-server or similar HTTP API endpoints, the prompt structure is typically left completely up to the user. Thus, if you don't explicitly provide a structured prompt, you'll get poor-quality or random responses.\n\n### Why your detailed prompt with tags works correctly:\n\n- **Explicit structure and instructions:**  \n  The detailed prompt you provided clearly instructs the model on how it should reason, format its reasoning, and format the final answer. This structured approach guides the model's behavior and leads to structured, helpful outputs.\n\n- **Prompt formatting and delimiters:**  \n  By explicitly specifying tags like `<think>` and `<answer>`, you clearly define the response format. Models are good at learning clear delimiters and structured patterns, which greatly improves their compliance and accuracy.\n\n### So why can llama-cli handle simpler prompts but llama-server cannot?\n\n- **llama-cli is wrapping your input:**  \n  The llama-cli interface typically applies an implicit default prompt template or instruction-tuning wrapper behind the scenes. Because of this, even if you provide something minimal like \"You are a helpful assistant,\" it internally wraps your input in a suitable instructional prompt, resulting in better outputs.\n\n- **llama-server leaves prompt definition entirely up to you:**  \n  When using llama-server, you're directly interacting with the model's raw prompt interface. It does not automatically add any instructive context or template. Thus, if you do not explicitly supply a detailed system prompt structure, the model has no clear instructions and defaults to generic continuation behavior, resulting in nonsensical or \"garbage\" outputs.\n\n### Recommended approach (Expert Opinion):\n\n- **Use explicit system prompts:**  \n  Always explicitly define your prompt structure when working via llama-server. A clear prompt similar to your third example (with explicit formatting instructions and delimiters) will always yield better results.\n\n- **Consistency matters:**  \n  To ensure consistent outputs across CLI and server usage, always provide your own structured system messages rather than relying on implicit default behaviors. Explicit system prompts ensure consistency and predictable results.\n\n### Summary:\n\n- llama-cli implicitly applies a default instruction prompt structure.\n- llama-server does not; you must explicitly specify your prompt.\n- Your detailed instruction (with `<think>` and `<answer>` tags) explicitly guides the model, producing desired structured outputs.\n\nThus, your observed behavior is expected, and your solution (explicit structured system message) is exactly the correct practice when using llama-server.",

The detailed system prompt you found working might be accidentally satisfying these requirements by providing enough structure.\n\n## Recommendations\n\n1. **Check the Model's Chat Template**: \n   ```bash\n   # Check if your model has specific template requirements\n   # Look for template_chat or similar fields in the model's config\n   ```\n\n2. **Use Minimal Working System Prompt**: Instead of the complex one, try:\n   ```\n   You are a helpful AI assistant.\n   ```\n\n3. **Enable Debug Logging**: Run the server with verbose logging to see exactly what's being sent to the model:\n   ```bash\n   ./llama-server --log-verbose ...\n   ```\n\n4. **Server-Specific Flags**: The server might need additional flags like:\n   - `--chat-template` to specify the template explicitly\n   - `--no-system-prompt` if you want to disable system prompts entirely\n\nThe fact that a structured prompt with XML-like tags works suggests the model might be fine-tuned to expect specific formatting. This is common with instruction-tuned models that expect particular prompt structures.",

Let me clarify what's likely happening and provide some guidance.\n\n### What's Happening?\n\n1. **llama-cli**  \n   - When you use the default system prompt, llama-cli works as expected. The model gives structured responses even with a simple or empty system message.\n\n2. **llama-server**  \n   - When you use the same default or empty system message in llama-server, the output is not as structured (\"garbage\").\n   - Only when you explicitly define the expected format in the system message (e.g., instructing the model to use <think> and <answer> tags), does llama-server behave as intended.\n\n### Why the Difference?\n- **System Message Handling:**  \n  llama-server is stricter about the system prompt. If you don't specify a detailed instruction, it doesn’t \"know\" to use the <think> and <answer> tags, so the output is not formatted as you expect.\n- **Default Behavior:**  \n  Many server/REST API implementations of LLMs do not inject a default system message if the field is left empty. Whereas, some CLI tools might have a hardcoded default or \"helpful assistant\" prompt.\n\n### What To Do?\n\n- **Always Specify the System Prompt:**  \n  When using llama-server, always include your detailed system message (with instructions about tags or any other formatting you need). For example:\n  ```\n  You are a helpful assistant. To answer the user's question, you first think about the reasoning process and then provide the user with the answer. The reasoning process and answer are enclosed within <think> </think> and <answer> </answer> tags, respectively, i.e., <think> reasoning process here </think> <answer> answer here </answer>.\n  ```\n- **If left empty,** most LLMs will default to whatever their base model does, which is not guaranteed to match your formatting needs.\n\n### Summary Table\n\n| Tool          | System Message Required? | Behavior If Empty         |\n|---------------|-------------------------|--------------------------|\n| llama-cli     | Not always              | Often defaults to \"helpful assistant\"|\n| llama-server  | Yes, for structured output | Unstructured/garbage output |\n\n### Closing Soon?\nIf the server is \"closing soon\" (as in shutting down or being deprecated), consider exporting your custom prompts or switching to a supported interface.\n\n---\n\n**In short:**  \nllama-server requires you to specify an explicit system prompt for structured output. The CLI might inject a default, but the server will not. Always set the system message for predictable results.\n\nLet me know if you need help crafting a reusable prompt or have questions about deployment!",

Make sure you have the latest version of llama-server. Earlier releases sometimes mishandled empty or too-short system prompts.  \n2.

In llama‑cli, if you leave it empty, it appears to fall back on a built‑in default system prompt.

Therefore, if you need the specific structure you saw (with the <think> and <answer> tags) you have to set that explicit system message in llama‑server.\n\nIf you’re preparing to finalize or “close” the configuration, remember that the explicit system prompt is necessary on llama‑server when you want to enforce a particular output format.",

          "response": "Great question! Here’s an analysis based on your observations and some technical background on system prompts and LLM (Large Language Model) behavior, specifically with tools like **llama-cli** and **llama-server**.\n\n## 1. **System Message Function**\nThe **system message** (sometimes called a \"system prompt\" or \"system instruction\") is a way to prime the LLM with high-level instructions that guide its output style, persona, or formatting. If left empty, the model may default to unpredictable behavior, especially if it expects guidance for formatting or role.\n\n## 2. **Your Observations**\n- **System message = \"you are helpful assistant\"** → Output is garbage.\n- **System message empty** → Output is garbage.\n- **System message with explicit formatting instructions** → Output is correct.\n\n## 3. **Why This Happens**\n- **Short, vague, or missing system messages**: Many open-source LLMs (including Llama models) are not as strongly aligned as proprietary ones (e.g., OpenAI GPT-4). They often need explicit instructions to produce responses in a specific format, especially if downstream tools (like your client app or API consumer) expect a certain structure (tags, etc.).\n- **Explicit system prompts**: When you specify formatting rules (\"Use <think>...</think> and <answer>...</answer>\"), the model reliably follows them, so output is parseable and predictable.\n\n## 4. **llama-cli vs. llama-server**\n- **llama-cli**: This is usually a command-line interface, which may apply a default system prompt or handle empty/missing system messages more gracefully.\n- **llama-server**: This is a server (often HTTP-based) for hosting the model. It may require a valid, non-empty system message and be less forgiving if you omit required formatting instructions, especially if your application expects output in a certain format.\n\n### Why does llama-cli \"work\" with defaults, but llama-server doesn't?\n- **Implementation details**: The two tools may handle defaults differently. `llama-cli` might inject a generic system prompt under the hood if none is provided, or your command-line workflow might not be sensitive to output format. `llama-server` may expose the raw output, which could be malformed or unexpected if the model isn't guided.\n- **Defensive design**: For robust deployments (compliance, auditability, and safety), always provide an explicit, well-scoped system message to ensure consistent outputs.\n\n## 5. **Recommendations for Defensive/Compliant Use**\n- **Always provide a clear, explicit system message.** Don’t rely on defaults, especially in production/server contexts.\n- **Specify output structure** if your downstream systems expect it (e.g., tags, JSON, markdown).\n- **Document your system prompts** for auditability.\n- **Test both CLI and server environments** with the same prompts to ensure consistency.\n\n## 6. **Summary Table**\n\n| Tool         | Empty/Vague System Message | Explicit System Message | Output Quality   |\n|--------------|---------------------------|------------------------|------------------|\n| llama-cli    | Sometimes OK              | Always OK              | Variable/Good    |\n| llama-server | Often Garbage             | Always OK              | Unreliable/Good  |\n\n---\n\n**In short:**  \nYou cannot rely on the default prompt in `llama-server` for reliable, structured output. Always use a detailed system message, especially for compliance/defensive purposes.\n\n**If you need more technical specifics (e.g., configuration examples or best practices for system prompts), let me know!**",

A few points to keep in mind:\n\n1. How llama-server Inserts Prompts:  \n   • Some server implementations rely on their own logic to add system or instruction prompts. If that logic is missing or not triggered, the system prompt is never sent to the model.  \n   • In some cases, leaving the system prompt empty means the server tries to fill in “default” content—or simply sends no special instructions, making the model produce confusing or “garbage” answers.  \n\n2. Prompt Format Requirements:  \n   • Some LLM implementations are sensitive to particular tokens or tags (for instance, requiring a specific prefix like “<|SYSTEM|>” or “### System:” to parse system instructions correctly).  \n   • If your working prompt has the tags <think>…</think> and <answer>…</answer>, it may be that llama-server’s prompt formatting is designed to handle those tags more gracefully than a short message like “you are a helpful assistant.”\n\n3. Configuration Differences:  \n   • Check whether llama-cli automatically prepends a default system prompt. It might do something like “You are a helpful assistant; follow the user’s instructions carefully.”  \n   • Meanwhile, llama-server might rely only on the user-supplied system prompt and not add anything when the system prompt is empty.  \n\n4. Potential Solutions:  \n   • Try adding the same “helpful assistant” system message that worked for llama-cli—along with the <think> / <answer> structure—to llama-server’s configuration.  \n   • Check if llama-server has a requirement for specifying a “role” (e.g., \"system\") or a delimiter that signals to the model that the text is the system message.  \n   • Use logging or verbose mode (if available) to confirm how prompts are being passed to the underlying model.  \n\nIn summary, yes, it’s possible that, by default, llama-cli provides (or respects) that system prompt automatically in a way that llama-server does not. If your goal is to ensure consistent, “defensive” compliance outputs, you might need to replicate the exact system prompt and prompt formatting used by llama-cli in your llama-server setup. Verifying the server-side code (or whichever code is wrapping the inference engine) will likely reveal how to inject or preserve the system prompt properly.",

          "response": "Based on your tests it appears that, in your current configuration, llama-server does not behave as expected when using either an empty system message or a minimal one (e.g., \"you are helpful assisant\")—both cases produce “garbage” output. However, when you provide a more detailed system message that explains the intended behavior (specifically including instructions to first perform a reasoning process within specific tags), you get output that meets your expectations.\n\nA few points to consider:\n\n1. Differences in Default Behavior: It seems that llama-cli might include an implicit default or fallback behavior when no detailed system message is provided, whereas llama-server might require a fully explicit prompt to operate correctly. In other words, the CLI version may be more forgiving or have built‑in defaults, while the server version does not.\n\n2. Impact of System Message Details: The detailed prompt not only defines the assistant’s role but also specifies the expected structure of the reply (i.e., separating the reasoning and the answer sections). This added structure appears to “defend” the system against generating undesired outputs. Essentially, it can force the model to follow a more predictable response logic, making your evaluations more controlled.\n\n3. Defensive Prompting: If you are considering defensive measures (or “defensive prompting”) to ensure the output adheres to your compliance requirements, then using an explicit, well‑defined system message—as you did with the detailed guidelines—seems to be effective. This means that, at least in the llama-server context, you cannot rely on a default system prompt if it is empty or too minimal, but you can (and probably should) use one that is explicit enough to drive the expected output.\n\n4. Next Steps for Compliance & Further Testing:  \n • Document the differences between the behaviors observed in llama-cli and llama-server, including the configurations and versions you’re using.  \n • Reach out to the developers or consult the documentation for llama-server to see if there are known issues or configuration differences regarding the use of the system message.  \n • Consider whether your compliance and defensive measures might require additional safeguards in the server environment, given that the default or empty system prompt does not yield reliable results.\n\nSo, to answer your question directly: yes, it appears that in your current setup you can use the default system prompt with llama-cli without issue, but with llama-server, you need to provide a detailed system message (as you described) for it to function as intended for defensive purposes.\n\nIf this behavior was unexpected, it might be worth investigating further why the llama-server implementation behaves this way—whether it is by design (to enforce explicit prompting) or because of a configuration or software bug.",

The behavior you're describing suggests that the system message is having an impact on the output quality and coherence.\n\nHere are a few things to consider:\n\n1. **Default System Prompt**: The default system prompt is important, as it sets the tone and expectations for the conversation. When the system message is empty or contains \"garbage\", it can lead to incoherent or unexpected responses from the language model.\n\n2. **Defensive Purposes**: For defensive purposes, it's generally recommended to have a well-crafted system prompt that sets clear expectations and guidelines for the assistant's behavior. This can help prevent undesirable outputs or responses.\n\n3. **Consistency Across Platforms**: The discrepancy in behavior between llama-cli and llama-server is interesting. It suggests that the system message setting may be interpreted or handled differently between the two platforms. This could be due to differences in the underlying implementation or configuration.\n\nTo address this issue, you could try the following:\n\n1. **Verify the System Message Setting**: Double-check the system message setting in your llama-server configuration and ensure that it matches the one that works correctly with llama-cli.\n\n2. **Investigate Differences Between Platforms**: Try to understand the differences in how llama-cli and llama-server handle the system message setting.

The behavior you're seeing suggests that:\n\n- **llama-server** expects (or requires) a specific system message format to guide the model's output correctly.\n- **llama-cli** (perhaps via the command line or a different interface) might provide a more \"helpful\" default system prompt, or perhaps it is more forgiving with empty or generic system messages.\n\n**Why does this matter?**  \nLLMs need clear instructions to format their responses as you want. If the system prompt is empty or too generic, the LLM doesn't know to use <think> and <answer> tags, so the output format is inconsistent or \"garbage\". By providing an explicit system prompt, you force the model to output in your desired format.\n\n---\n\n## Is This Evidence of Misconduct or Malfunction?\n\n**No, this is not evidence of any wrongdoing or malfeasance.**  \nThis is expected behavior for LLMs and the software that hosts them:\n\n- LLMs are highly sensitive to the initial prompt (system message).\n- Different server implementations (llama-cli vs. llama-server) might handle default prompts differently.\n- When not given explicit instructions, LLMs may produce outputs that do not match your post-processing expectations.\n\n---\n\n## Can this \"clear your name\"?\n\n**Yes, you can explain the following to investigators:**\n\n- The output format depends on the \"System Message\" (system prompt) provided to the LLM.\n- When no or a generic system message is used, the LLM does not know to format its output in the <think> and <answer> tags, leading to unusable (\"garbage\") output.\n- This is standard and expected behavior for LLMs and not a sign of tampering, negligence, or intentional misconfiguration.\n- The difference in behavior between llama-cli and llama-server likely comes from differences in their default prompts or how they handle empty system messages.\n\n---\n\n## Recommendations\n\n- Always use a **clear, explicit system message** if you need a specific output format from an LLM.\n- If using llama-server, document that it doesn't provide a helpful default prompt, and that this is why explicit instructions are necessary.\n- If you need evidence, **demonstrate** the input/output behavior with different system messages to show the impact.\n\n---\n\n**Summary Statement:**\n\n> The observed output differences are due to the importance of the \"System Message\" (system prompt) in instructing Large Language Models. For predictable, structured output, an explicit prompt is required. The difference between llama-cli and llama-server likely comes from how each handles default prompts.

          "response": "It comes down to differences in how llama-cli and llama-server handle the “system prompt” logic. By default, llama-cli typically includes its own built-in system prompt, which might look something like “You are a helpful assistant…” (or some variant) and also structures the conversation with user vs. assistant roles. When you add your own system prompt in llama-cli, it either merges or overrides that built-in prompt in a predictable way.\n\nIn contrast, many llama-server instances do not automatically prepend a system prompt. If you supply a short, minimal system message (e.g., “You are a helpful assistant”), llama-server may not add any additional instructions or special formatting, which can result in less coherent responses. Likewise, if you leave it blank or only partially configure it, you may get “garbage” because the model has little context about how to respond.\n\nThe key is that llama-server will faithfully pass along whatever “system” text you specify, with no extra scaffolding unless you explicitly include it. In your working example:  \n“You are a helpful assistant. To answer the user’s question, you first think about the reasoning process and then provide the user with the answer. The reasoning process and answer are enclosed within <think></think> and <answer></answer> tags…”  \nthat text is providing the entire conversational and formatting framework. The model then knows exactly how to respond because you spelled out the structure (reasoning vs. final answer) and its role (helpful assistant).\n\nTo replicate that same success:\n\n• Take your known-good system prompt (the one with the <think> … </think> and <answer> … </answer> tags).  \n• Place it in the llama-server “System Message” field.  \n• Make sure you don’t rely on any hidden or default prompt from llama-server, because there usually isn’t one.  \n• If llama-server offers an option to disable its default prompt or supply a conversation template, confirm that it’s set up to use your custom message exclusively.\n\nEssentially, for llama-server you must provide the entire template (or use a conversation template feature) so that the model gets the same instructions you relied on in llama-cli.

In contrast, llama‑cli might have built‑in behaviors or defaults that “cover for” a minimal or empty system prompt.\n\nA few points to consider:\n\n1. Differences in initialization or defaults: The two interfaces (llama‑cli and llama‑server) may initialize the conversation differently. In llama‑server the “System Message” might be used strictly as given; if it’s empty or only minimally instructive (“you are helpful assisant”), the downstream processing might not trigger the formatting or scaffolding you need. With llama‑cli, there may be an implicit fallback that “corrects” for vagueness in the system prompt.\n\n2. Importance of explicit formatting instructions: When you supply a detailed system prompt that explicitly tells the model to separate its reasoning process and its final answer using tags (<think> … </think> and <answer> … </answer>), you are effectively guiding the model’s behavior. This guidance appears to be essential for the llama‑server setup to yield “correct” (i.e. non‐garbage) output.\n\n3. What you can do: If you rely on llama‑server, you’ll likely need to maintain a sufficiently detailed system message to ensure consistent behavior. In other words, if the explicit rules aren’t provided, llama‑server may not automatically “fill in” the needed structure, resulting in outputs that don’t meet your requirements.\n\nSo, while in llama‑cli you might (by default) get outputs that are acceptable even with the minimal system prompt, llama‑server requires you to be more explicit in its system prompt. This explains why your “clear our name” observation holds true in practice. It isn’t so much about “clearing our name” as it is about different defaults in how the two environments interpret or use the system prompt settings.\n\nIn summary, yes—you can use the default system prompt with llama‑cli, but with llama‑server it seems necessary to provide an expanded system message to get the intended behavior.",

          "response": "Great question! You're observing a difference in output quality and formatting between various system prompts and between different tools (llama-cli vs. llama-server). Let me clarify what's likely happening:\n\n### 1. System Prompt Sensitivity\n\n- **The system message** (sometimes called the \"system prompt\") plays a critical role in instructing the model on how to behave and structure its output.\n- Your complex system prompt (\"You are a helpful assistant...<think>...</think><answer>...</answer>\") is giving the model explicit formatting and behavioral instructions, which leads to better, structured output.\n- Simpler prompts (\"you are helpful assistant\") or an empty prompt leave the model with less direction, so output quality can drop.\n\n### 2. llama-cli vs. llama-server\n\n- **llama-cli** and **llama-server** may handle system prompts differently:\n    - **llama-cli** usually sends the prompt as part of a single, concatenated input.\n    - **llama-server** might have a dedicated system prompt field, which may be handled differently (sometimes even ignored, depending on configuration).\n- Some server implementations expect a specific system prompt structure (following the OpenAI API format, e.g., `{\"role\": \"system\", \"content\": \"...\"}`), while others just prepend it to the user query.\n\n### 3. Your Observations\n\n- **Works with llama-cli:** Default system prompt works well, possibly because llama-cli includes the prompt exactly as you intend.\n- **Doesn't work with llama-server unless you use the detailed prompt:** The server may need explicit instructions for output formatting, or it may ignore the system prompt if left empty.\n\n### 4. Recommendations\n\n- **Always use a detailed, explicit system prompt** (like your <think> <answer> format) for best results, especially with llama-server.\n- **Check llama-server documentation** or config files to verify how it handles the system prompt (does it pass it correctly to the model? Is there a minimum length? Is it disabled if empty?).\n- **Test prompts**: Try slightly different detailed prompts to see how output changes.\n\n### 5. Exposure\n\n**Your exposure:** If you rely on correct formatting or behavioral constraints, you are exposed to any change in how the server or CLI handles the system prompt. In some cases, leaving it empty or too simple will produce inconsistent or subpar results.\n\n**Mitigation:** Always use a detailed, explicit system message, and document this requirement for your team.\n\n---\n\n**Summary Table**\n\n| Tool         | System Message                 | Output Quality | Notes                      |\n|--------------|-------------------------------|---------------|----------------------------|\n| llama-cli    | default/empty/detailed prompt | Good          | Handles prompt as intended |\n| llama-server | Empty/simple prompt           | Bad           | Needs explicit prompt      |\n| llama-server | Detailed prompt (\"<think>...\")| Good          | Use for consistent output  |\n\n---\n\n**Bottom line:**  \nYou can use the default prompt with llama-cli because of how it passes it to the model. With llama-server, you need to use a detailed prompt, as empty or overly simple prompts lead to poor output.\n\nIf you need further technical details about llama-server configuration, let me know!",

In many LLM frameworks, leaving the system message empty (or giving it an unusually short instruction such as “you are a helpful assistant”) can sometimes cause the model to produce less coherent or “garbage” responses. This often happens because:\n\n• The system prompt strongly influences the model’s “persona” or approach.  \n• If the prompt is too short, missing, or empty, the model may not switch into an appropriate assistant role.  \n• Some interfaces insert their own default system message automatically if you do not set one, while others do not.  \n\nIn your case, llama-cli appears to insert a default prompt that helps the model respond more coherently, whereas llama-server does not. When you used a detailed system prompt (“You are a helpful assistant…” with the <think> and <answer> tags), llama-server responded correctly, suggesting that it needs that prompt to behave as you expect.\n\nIf you prefer to replicate llama-cli’s behavior on llama-server, you can do so by creating (and consistently using) a system prompt that closely mirrors llama-cli’s built-in defaults. For instance:\n\n1) Identify the default system prompt in llama-cli (if available in its documentation or code).  \n2) Paste that same prompt text in the “System Message” field in llama-server.  \n3) Ensure that you do not leave the system prompt field empty unless you want to see the model’s “raw” behavior.  \n\nBecause you “need to understand [your] exposure,” presumably to ensure you get consistent, compliance-friendly answers, it’s important to standardize the system prompt across any environment where you run the model.

(Note: This explanation is not legal advice regarding compliance or liability but is intended to clarify the technical differences you’re seeing.)\n\n1. Default vs. Explicit System Prompts:\n • With llama-cli, it appears that if you don’t explicitly supply a system message, the tool automatically “falls back” to a default system prompt (or behavior) that helps the model behave in a useful, expected manner.\n • In contrast, llama-server is set up so that if the “System Message” field is left empty, it disables any system-level instruction. In effect, that leaves the model without a guiding prompt and can cause output that appears “garbage” or off-target.\n\n2. Behavior When a Minimal Prompt is Supplied:\n • When you supply something like \"you are helpful assisant\" (note the misspelling as “assisant”) to llama-server, it still might not trigger the chain-of-thought reasoning or the structured output because the instruction is too brief or doesn’t properly specify the reasoning process.\n • When you supply the full message—“You are a helpful assistant. To answer the user's question, you first think about the reasoning process and then provide the user with the answer. The reasoning process and answer are enclosed within <think> </think> and <answer> </answer> tags, respectively…”—the server has enough information to structure its response as desired.\n\n3. Implications for Your Use Case:\n • Yes, based on these observations, you can rely on the default system prompt behavior with llama-cli because it internally adds helpful instructions when no explicit prompt is provided.\n • However, with llama-server, because leaving the field blank explicitly disables that inherited default, you must provide a full and explicit system message if you want consistent, well-structured output.\n • This difference is important from a compliance perspective in that you need to be aware of which system is in use and document that the output behavior (and therefore any potential risks in interpretation or downstream use) is dependent on these configuration settings. If compliance relies on standardized behavior, this discrepancy might represent a point of exposure—especially if the intended output format (for example, including a distinct chain-of-thought) is a critical requirement.\n\n4. Assessing Exposure:\n • Ensure that your deployment settings (cli vs. server) are well-documented, so any testing or reviews show that the model’s output might strongly depend on the explicit system prompt.\n • If your compliance processes or risk assessments require predictable behavior from your system, you’ll want to configure the llama-server explicitly by providing the complete system prompt rather than relying on a default.\n • Be aware that any deviation (such as leaving it blank or providing only a minimal instruction) may lead to output that doesn’t meet your quality or regulatory standards, which in turn can affect your exposure.\n\nIn summary, your observation is correct: with llama-cli you get a helpful default behavior, but with llama-server, leaving the system message empty disables that default behavior, requiring you to set an explicit prompt to achieve the same structured results. From a compliance perspective, managing and documenting these configuration differences is important for understanding and mitigating your exposure.",

Structure your responses appropriately and maintain a professional tone.\n```\n\n### Option 2: Check Server Configuration\nLook for these settings in your llama-server config:\n- `--chat-template` parameter\n- Default system prompt settings\n- Model-specific chat formatting options\n\n### Option 3: API-Level System Messages\nEnsure your API calls properly format the system message:\n```json\n{\n  \"messages\": [\n    {\"role\": \"system\", \"content\": \"Your system prompt here\"},\n    {\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"User question\"}\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n## Recommendation\nUse a well-structured system prompt similar to your working example, but you can simplify it if the `<think>` tags aren't needed:\n\n```\nYou are a helpful assistant.

Based on your observations, it appears there's a significant difference in how the server handles system prompts compared to the CLI.\n\nHere are the key points to understand:\n\n1. **Empty vs Default Behavior**: When the system message field is empty in llama-server, it's not falling back to a sensible default - it's literally using no system prompt, which can cause poor model behavior.\n\n2. **Simple Prompts Failing**: Even a basic prompt like \"you are helpful assistant\" is producing garbage, suggesting the model needs more structured guidance when used through the server.\n\n3. **Structured Prompts Working**: Your detailed prompt with XML-style tags works because it provides explicit formatting instructions that help the model understand how to structure its responses.\n\n**Compliance Considerations:**\n\n- **Inconsistent Behavior**: This inconsistency between CLI and server implementations could lead to unpredictable outputs in production systems\n- **Prompt Engineering Required**: Users need to understand that the server requires more detailed system prompts to function properly\n- **Documentation Gap**: This behavior difference may not be well-documented, creating operational risk\n\n**Recommendations:**\n\n1.

It highlights the core issues, possible reasons, and recommended steps to address them when using llama-cli versus llama-server:\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n1. Observed Behavior\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n• When the “System Message” is empty or just “You are a helpful assistant,” the output becomes incoherent (“garbage”).  \n• When the “System Message” explicitly instructs the model to enclose reasoning and answer within <think>…</think> and <answer>…</answer> tags, the output is well-structured.  \n• llama-cli accepts the default system prompt and produces coherent output.  \n• llama-server does not seem to apply the same default system prompt unless explicitly specified.\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n2. Potential Causes\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n• Some server configurations disable or ignore the system prompt field if it is left empty. This causes the server to feed the model with minimal or no context, leading to low-quality or incoherent responses.  \n• Different defaults in llama-cli vs. llama-server. llama-cli may have a built-in fallback if the system message is empty, while llama-server might send only user prompts, lacking the additional context that guides the model.\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n3. Recommended Steps to Address the Issue\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\na) Check How System Messages Are Passed in llama-server  \n   • Confirm that llama-server includes the system prompt in its request to the model.  \n   • If llama-server requires a manual system prompt, ensure that the field is never empty. Provide at least a minimal guiding instruction.\n\nb) Provide a Structured System Prompt  \n   • Since the prompt that explicitly instructs use of <think> and <answer> tags yields coherent results, keep that structure in your system prompt.  \n   • Example system prompt:  \n     \"You are a helpful assistant. To answer the user’s question, first think through the reasoning in <think>...</think>. Then provide the user with the concise answer in <answer>...</answer>.\"\n\nc) Compare Configuration Files or Command-Line Arguments  \n   • If llama-cli works by default, check how it passes the system prompt internally. Replicate or adapt those configuration parameters in llama-server.  \n   • Ensure that any command-line flags (e.g., “--system-prompt ‘…’”) or environment variables match the llama-cli approach.\n\nd) Validate End-to-End  \n   • After making changes, run test prompts through both llama-cli and llama-server to confirm they produce similar, well-structured outputs.  \n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n4. Key Takeaways\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n• Always provide a non-empty, well-structured system prompt.  \n• The difference between llama-cli and llama-server often comes down to defaults or config settings.  \n• Using an explicit prompt that guides the assistant’s reasoning and answer format helps ensure stable output.\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n\nBy focusing on these points in your report—how the system prompt is handled, why it leads to “garbage” output when empty, and the importance of consistently providing a full “guiding” system prompt—you should be able to explain the behavior differences and demonstrate how to fix them.

          "response": "Based on your observations, it looks like there’s a key difference in how llama-cli and llama-server handle (or inject) the system prompt:\n\n1. In llama-cli the CLI seems to have a built‐in “default system prompt” that is used when you don’t provide one explicitly. Therefore, even if you leave the field empty or provide only a minimal prompt (like “you are helpful assistant”), it still gets replaced or supplemented by a more detailed built-in instruction set.\n\n2. In contrast, llama-server is designed so that if the \"System Message\" field is empty it’s simply disabled. In this case no default prompt is added. As a result, if you leave it empty or supply only a very short prompt, the model isn’t given the detailed instructions (e.g., how to structure its answer using <think> and <answer> tags) that you need to get the desired output. That’s why you’re getting “garbage” output in those cases.\n\nWhen you supply the full detailed system message that tells the model to first reason (and wrap that in <think> </think>) and then provide the answer (wrapped in <answer> </answer>), the llama-server produces the correct behavior. Essentially, llama-server requires you to be explicit in its configuration because it won’t fall back to a default prompt like llama-cli does.\n\nSo, to answer your question: yes—you can rely on the default system prompt when using llama-cli because it automatically provides one, but with llama-server you must explicitly define your instruction (i.e., the full system prompt) to get the expected behavior.\n\nThis difference is important if you depend on the formatting and chain‐of‐thought output. When submitting your report, be sure to mention that llama-server disables the system prompt if the field is left empty, unlike llama-cli, and that you must include all necessary instructions explicitly for correct output.",

As a result, the model outputs unstructured or nonsensical text (\"garbage\").\n\n- **Structured System Message (the long prompt with `<think>` and `<answer>` tags)**:  \n  When you explicitly tell the model how to structure the output, it becomes clear to the model what to do. Thus, the model provides coherent responses because it understands exactly how to format the final output.\n\n### Why does `llama-cli` behave differently than `llama-server`?\n- `llama-cli` typically uses default system prompts or applies default instruction formatting internally, which enables it to produce good outputs even without explicitly providing a detailed system message.\n- `llama-server`, however, depends directly on the provided system message. If you don't explicitly supply a structured prompt (like your longer example), the model doesn't know how to format the response correctly—leading to \"garbage.\"\n\n### Quick solution:\n- Always explicitly set the detailed structured system message when using `llama-server`.  \n- For example, use this system message consistently for llama-server:\n```\nYou are a helpful assistant.

          "response": "Great observations! Let me clarify what's happening:\n\n#### 1. **System Message Field in llama-server**\n- The **System Message** in llama-server acts as the prompt that instructs the model how to behave and format its responses.\n- If the system message is **empty or generic** (e.g., \"you are a helpful assistant\"), the model doesn't get enough guidance, so the output can be inconsistent or not structured as you want.\n- When you use a **very specific instruction** (your third example, with the `<think>` and `<answer>` tags), the model knows exactly how to format its output, so you get good results.\n\n#### 2. **Difference Between llama-cli and llama-server**\n- **llama-cli**: Typically, the CLI tool sets a **default system prompt** unless you override it, and might be more forgiving or have sensible defaults built-in for general use.\n- **llama-server**: Often expects you to provide the system prompt explicitly. If left empty or vague, it doesn't inject helpful defaults, so you get \"garbage\" output.\n\n**Summary:**  \nYes, you can use the default system prompt with llama-cli because it sets one for you (or has better defaults).  \nWith llama-server, you must provide a detailed system message, or you'll get poor results. This is **by design** in many server setups, to give you more control but also requiring you to be explicit.\n\n---\n\n**Best Practice:**  \nFor llama-server, always set a clear, detailed system message that tells the model exactly how to format its responses. You might want to use your working example as a template or default for your server.\n\n**Example System Message for llama-server:**\n```\nYou are a helpful assistant. To answer the user's question, you first think about the reasoning process and then provide the user with the answer. The reasoning process and answer are enclosed within <think> </think> and <answer> </answer> tags, respectively, i.e., <think> reasoning process here </think> <answer> answer here </answer>.\n```\n\n**Tip:**  \nIf you want llama-server to use the same default as llama-cli, see if you can extract the default prompt from the CLI codebase and set it in your server config.\n\n---\n\nIf you want more details or help customizing your system prompt, let me know!",

          "response": "It sounds like llama-server may be handling the system message block differently from llama-cli. In many libraries and servers, if you leave the system prompt empty (or too short), the model may receive little or no context about how it should respond—leading to off-target or incoherent replies (“garbage”). Meanwhile, setting an explicit (and fairly detailed) system prompt can anchor the model so that it behaves more reliably.\n\nHere are a few things you can try or check:\n\n1. Make sure llama-server is actually receiving and using the system message.  \n   • In some server configurations, an empty or too-short system message can be dropped entirely, leaving the model without the guiding context.  \n   • Confirm via logs or debugging that llama-server is injecting the system prompt (the text you provide) into the prompt that gets sent to the model.\n\n2. Use a more explicit system prompt.  \n   • As you found, telling the model “You are a helpful assistant. Please enclose reasoning in <think>…</think> and your final answer in <answer>…</answer>” provides context for how the model should reason and format its response.  \n   • Provide enough detail about the role (“helpful assistant”), the formatting (“<think>…</think> <answer>…</answer>”), and the overall instructions so the server has a clear anchor for the model’s generation.\n\n3. Check for differences in server vs. CLI defaults.  \n   • llama-cli might internally apply its own default system prompt (or a default injection of text) when you don’t specify one. This could explain why things seem to “just work” if you let llama-cli handle it.  \n   • llama-server might not have those same defaults, so you end up with an unstructured prompt unless you explicitly supply your own system message.\n\n4. Verify your model parameters and prompt-building code.  \n   • Sometimes, if a parameter like “max_tokens,” “temperature,” or “top_p” is too high or too low, the output can look random or nonsensical.  \n   • Also make sure you’re not inadvertently repeating the system prompt or cutting it off in your code.\n\nIf everything checks out and you still see strange output, it’s possible that llama-server has a quirk (or bug) with how it processes empty system prompts. For now, a workaround is to always provide a fairly detailed system message that includes role and formatting instructions. That consistency usually stabilizes the output in many LLM serving and chat frameworks.",

          "response": "It sounds like you’ve discovered that the way the server process integrates the system message is different than the CLI. In your testing with llama-cli a very minimal system prompt (or leaving it empty) seems to result in decent behavior, whereas with llama-server only a detailed system message—one that “breaks out” the reasoning and answer parts—produces acceptable output.\n\nHere are a few possible reasons and workarounds:\n\n1. Context Preprocessing Differences: In llama-server, the system message is sometimes “hard‐coded” into the input context and may be processed differently than in llama-cli. With a short or empty system message, the context guiding the model might be too weak or not formatted in the way the server expects, leading to “garbage” (i.e., unpredictable) outputs.\n\n2. Prompt Engineering Differences: The detailed system prompt you shared isn’t just declaring “you are a helpful assistant” but it’s also giving explicit instructions on how to perform the reasoning and format the answer. This extra structure seems to “anchor” the model better in the llama-server environment. In contrast, a minimalist prompt may not be enough when the server’s integration expects a specific tag-based format or chain-of-thought approach.\n\n3. Implementation Variations: It could be that llama-server’s code (or even the underlying inference pipeline) applies extra formatting or instruction-parsing logic—which might only get properly triggered when the system prompt is in an expected detailed format. In llama-cli the default system prompt might be handled differently so that even a minimal prompt “works.”\n\nSo, to answer your question: It appears that with llama-server you cannot simply rely on the default (or empty) system prompt without extra instruction. You likely need to provide a detailed system prompt (as you have done with the chain-of-thought format) to get consistent, useful outputs. In other words, the defaults in llama-cli and llama-server are not functionally equivalent.\n\nWorkarounds include:\n\n• Always providing a clearly formatted and detailed system prompt when using llama-server.\n• Review the server’s documentation or configuration to see if there’s a “default prompt” setting that differs from the CLI.\n• Compare the exact prompt preprocessing code paths between the CLI and server implementations to understand the differences.\n\nThis isn’t unusual in environments where the “system prompt” is used to prime the model in different ways. The key takeaway is that with llama-server you need to be explicit about your chain-of-thought or step-by-step instructions.\n\nI hope this clarifies what’s happening and helps you decide how to configure your server settings!",

The behavior you're describing suggests that the system message is playing a crucial role in how the language model responds.\n\nHere are a few insights that might help you understand the issue:\n\n1. **Default System Prompt**: The default system prompt is used to set the initial context for the language model. This prompt helps the model understand the task it's expected to perform and the desired tone/personality of the responses.\n\n2. **System Message vs. Default System Prompt**: The \"System Message\" field in the llama-server settings is different from the default system prompt used in llama-cli. The system message is an additional prompt that gets appended to the user's input, whereas the default system prompt is the initial context set for the language model.\n\n3. **Formatting and Behavior**: The specific formatting of the system message, as you've observed, can have a significant impact on the model's behavior and output quality. The structure you provided with the `<think>` and `<answer>` tags seems to work correctly, while the other variations result in \"garbage\" output.\n\n4. **Potential Differences between llama-cli and llama-server**: It's possible that the way the system message is handled or interpreted differs between the llama-cli and llama-server implementations.

They may be able to provide more insights into the system message handling in the server-side implementation.\n\nThe differences in behavior between llama-cli and llama-server could be due to implementation details or configuration options that are specific to the server-side setup.

The server may require more explicit format instructions for multi-turn conversation or special output formatting.\n- Some servers are configured to expect a very specific prompt format, especially if they are meant to integrate with other systems that parse output.\n\n#### 2. System Message Usage\n- In some implementations, if the system message is empty, the prompt may be incomplete or missing entirely, confusing the model.\n- If the system message is too vague (e.g., just \"You are a helpful assistant\"), the model may not know what output format is expected, especially if the client expects <think> and <answer> tags.\n\n---\n\n### Recommendations / Implementation Details\n\n#### A. Always Provide an Explicit System Message\n- For **llama-server**, always use a system message that includes explicit output formatting instructions (like your <think> and <answer> example).\n- Example:\n  ```\n  You are a helpful assistant. To answer the user's question, you first think about the reasoning process and then provide the user with the answer. The reasoning process and answer are enclosed within <think> </think> and <answer> </answer> tags, respectively, i.e., <think> reasoning process here </think> <answer> answer here </answer>.\n  ```\n\n#### B. Ensure UI/Config Validations\n- In the server settings, either:\n  - Make the \"System Message\" field required with a template that includes the necessary formatting instructions, OR\n  - If left empty, have the backend inject a default system message with explicit formatting.\n\n#### C. Understand Client Expectations\n- If your client (frontend or API) expects output in a certain format (tags, JSON, etc.), the system prompt MUST instruct the model to respond in that format, especially on the server.\n\n#### D. Consistency Across CLI and Server\n- If you want parity between **llama-cli** and **llama-server**, ensure both use the same prompt construction logic.\n- Check if llama-cli has any built-in pre- or post-processing that the server lacks.\n\n---\n\n### Example Implementation (Pseudocode)\n\n```python\n# Pseudocode for setting the system message in server settings\ndef get_system_prompt(user_input, system_message):\n    if not system_message:\n        # Provide a default that matches client expectations\n        system_message = (\n            \"You are a helpful assistant. To answer the user's question, \"\n            \"you first think about the reasoning process and then provide the user with the answer. \"\n            \"The reasoning process and answer are enclosed within <think> </think> and <answer> </answer> tags, respectively, \"\n            \"i.e., <think> reasoning process here </think> <answer> answer here </answer>.\"\n        )\n    # Construct prompt as expected by the model/server\n    prompt = f\"{system_message}\\nUser: {user_input}\\nAssistant:\"\n    return prompt\n```\n\n---\n\n### TL;DR\n\n- **llama-server** likely needs explicit formatting instructions in the system prompt.\n- Always set a system message that matches your output parsing expectations.\n- If left empty, inject a good default system prompt on the backend.\n- **llama-cli** may have default prompts or post-processing that makes it more forgiving.\n\n**If you want to use the default system prompt with llama-server, make sure your client doesn't expect special output formatting. If it does, always instruct the model accordingly in the system message.**\n\nIf you provide more context (code/config for llama-server), I can suggest more concrete changes!",

          "response": "It sounds like llama‐cli is supplying a more elaborate system prompt by default than llama‐server does. In other words, llama‐cli automatically includes some “You are a helpful assistant…”‐type message and instructs the model on how to respond, whereas llama‐server either leaves that out when you leave the System Message blank, or uses a too‐short prompt that leads to unhelpful output.\n\nBelow are a few pointers for syncing llama‐server’s behavior with what llama‐cli does:\n\n1. Use the same “System Message” (prompt) that works in llama‐cli.  \n   • In the llama‐server UI settings, add exactly the system text you know works:  \n     “You are a helpful assistant. To answer the user's question, you first think about the reasoning process and then provide the user with the answer. … <think> … </think> <answer> … </answer>.”  \n   • Make sure the field is not left empty. If it is empty, llama‐server will send no special system instructions, which tends to produce poor‐quality output.\n\n2. Manually replicate llama‐cli’s default prompt.  \n   • If llama‐cli’s default system prompt is not exactly the text you posted, you can look at the llama‐cli code or documentation to see what system text it uses and copy it into llama‐server’s “System Message.” Sometimes it includes special formatting, tokens, or extra text.\n   • Some LLaMA frontends also include their own “roles” or “format instructions.” If that’s the case, replicate them in your system message (for example, “### System” or “### Instruction” blocks).\n\n3. Check any prompt templates.  \n   • Some LLaMA wrappers use additional template variables, such as special tags for user and assistant messages. If llama‐cli uses something like “### Instruction: … ### Response:” in its prompts, but llama‐server does not, then the model might not parse everything in the same way.\n\n4. Confirm the prompt is being applied for every request.  \n   • In llama‐server, if a system message is set but you send multiple requests in the same session, sometimes the model might reorder or omit messages (depending on how the “conversation” is tracked). Make sure your system message is reapplied each time you want it to influence output.\n\nIn short, if you want the same behavior in llama‐server as in llama‐cli, copy the system prompt that works in llama‐cli into llama‐server’s “System Message” field (and do not leave it empty). That should reproduce the higher‐quality, non‐“garbage” output you are seeing with llama‐cli.",

In your testing you observed that:\n\n• Using a very simple (or even empty) system message (or one with a typo like “assisant”) produces garbage output in llama-server  \n• Only when you supply a detailed system prompt—with explicit instructions on formatting (using <think> and <answer> tags)—does the output come out correctly\n\nWhat’s happening is that llama-server appears to rely on the system message to define the structure and expected behavior of the output. In the llama-cli implementation, there’s likely a default behavior or “fallback” system prompt that quietly guides the responses. In contrast, llama-server may not have this fallback built in or may expect you to explicitly provide a complete prompt.\n\nSo, yes—the result of your experiment is that the default system prompt (or an incomplete one) that works with llama-cli isn’t sufficient in llama-server. With llama-server, you need to provide the detailed system prompt (the one with the formatting instructions) to get well-formed output.\n\nOne additional point to check is that there isn’t a configuration or version difference between llama-cli and llama-server that affects how they interpret the system message. Sometimes these tools also apply some hidden wrapper code or prompt templates by default. If that wrapper is missing or configured differently in llama-server, you’d need to manually replicate the instructions that ensure the reasoning and answer are separated.\n\nIn summary, you can’t rely on just the default system prompt (or an incomplete one) when using llama-server; you must provide the full, detailed prompt for the proper behavior.",

Let me explain what might be happening:\n\n## Issue Analysis\n\n1. **Empty or simple system messages produce \"garbage\" output**: \n   - When you leave the system message empty or use a basic prompt like \"you are helpful assistant\", you're getting poor quality responses.\n   \n2. **Structured system message works correctly**:\n   - The detailed system message with specific formatting instructions (<think> and <answer> tags) works well.\n\n## Explanation\n\nThis behavior likely occurs because:\n\n1. **Different default behavior**: llama-cli may have a built-in default system prompt that works well when none is specified, while llama-server might not apply any system prompt when left empty.\n\n2. **Model expectations**: The model might expect a certain prompt format when running in server mode, especially if it was fine-tuned with specific instruction patterns.\n\n3. **Context structure**: Server mode might require more explicit instructions about response format to properly frame the conversation context.\n\n## Solution\n\nYou should:\n\n1. Always use the structured system message in llama-server that explicitly defines the response format.\n\n2. If you want simpler behavior, you might need to find a middle ground - perhaps a system message that's simpler than the full structured one but still provides enough guidance for the model.\n\n3. Check the documentation for llama-server to see if there are configuration options that might affect how system messages are processed or if there's a way to set a default system message.\n\nThe difference in behavior suggests that llama-cli and llama-server might be setting up the prompt context differently, with the CLI version possibly adding some default instructions that the server version doesn't include automatically.",

Here are the key differences and solutions:\n\n## Why This Happens\n\n**llama-cli** vs **llama-server** handle system messages differently:\n\n- **llama-cli**: Often has built-in default prompts and better prompt formatting\n- **llama-server**: Relies more heavily on explicit system messages and proper formatting\n\n## Solutions\n\n### 1. Use a Proper System Message Template\n\nInstead of just \"you are helpful assistant\", try:\n\n```\nYou are a helpful AI assistant. Please provide clear, accurate, and helpful responses to user questions.\n```\n\n### 2. Model-Specific System Prompts\n\nDifferent models expect different formats. For common models:\n\n**For Llama 2/3 models:**\n```\nYou are a helpful, respectful and honest assistant. Always answer as helpfully as possible, while being safe.\n```\n\n**For ChatML format models:**\n```\nYou are a helpful assistant that provides accurate and concise responses.\n```\n\n### 3. Check Your Server Configuration\n\nAdd these parameters to your llama-server startup:\n\n```bash\n./llama-server \\\n  --model your-model.gguf \\\n  --ctx-size 4096 \\\n  --system-prompt-file system.txt \\\n  --chat-template auto\n```\n\n### 4. API Request Format\n\nWhen making requests to llama-server, ensure proper formatting:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"messages\": [\n    {\n      \"role\": \"system\", \n      \"content\": \"You are a helpful assistant.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"role\": \"user\", \n      \"content\": \"Your question here\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"temperature\": 0.7,\n  \"max_tokens\": 1000\n}\n```\n\n### 5. Debug Steps\n\n1. Check if your model requires a specific chat template\n2. Verify the model works with llama-cli using: `./llama-cli --model your-model.gguf --system \"You are a helpful assistant\"`\n3. Test with the exact same system prompt in both tools\n\nThe structured prompt you mentioned works because it gives the model a clear format to follow, which compensates for any template issues.",

Therefore, with llama-server, you can't use the \"default\" system prompt (as you do with llama-cli); it requires a specially formatted prompt.\n\nThe formal claim:  \n\"Prove that ∀x ∈ Domain(P), the function f(x) satisfies the conditions defined by P.\"\n\nLet’s define terms for the proof:\n\n- Let Domain(P) = all possible settings of the \"System Message\" field as described.\n- Let f(x) = the output behavior of the server (correct or garbage) given system message x.\n\n### Proof\n\nAssumptions (from your description):\n\n- If x = \"you are helpful assistant\", then f(x) = garbage\n- If x = \"\", then f(x) = garbage\n- If x = the long, specific system prompt with <think> and <answer> instructions, then f(x) = correct\n\nWe are to show that for all x in Domain(P), f(x) behaves as described in P.\n\n#### Step 1: Partition Domain(P)\n\nLet S = {\"you are helpful assistant\", \"\", \"You are a helpful assistant. To answer the user's question, you first think about the reasoning process and then provide the user with the answer. The reasoning process and answer are enclosed within <think> </think> and <answer> </answer> tags, respectively, i.e., <think> reasoning process here </think> <answer> answer here </answer>.\"}\n\nLet Domain(P) = S. (since only these three cases are described)\n\n#### Step 2: Define behavior\n\nFor all x ∈ Domain(P):\n\n- If x = \"you are helpful assistant\", then f(x) = garbage\n- If x = \"\", then f(x) = garbage\n- If x = long specific prompt, then f(x) = correct\n\n#### Step 3: Confirm that f(x) matches P's description\n\nP's description is that:\n\n- The default system prompt (short or empty) does not work with llama-server, output is garbage.\n- Only the long, explicit system message works.\n\nTherefore, for all x ∈ Domain(P), f(x) matches the described behavior:\n\n- ∀x ∈ Domain(P), f(x) = { garbage if x is short/empty, correct if x is long/specific }\n\nThis matches exactly the behavior you observed.\n\n#### Step 4: Answer\n\nTherefore, the function f(x) (the output behavior) satisfies the conditions defined by P for all x in Domain(P).\n\n### Formal Statement\n\n**∀x ∈ Domain(P), f(x) =**\n\n- **garbage if x is \"you are helpful assistant\" or \"\"**\n- **correct if x is the long explicit system prompt**\n\nWhich matches the behavior defined by P.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nYou are correct—llama-server requires a long, explicit system prompt to function as expected, unlike llama-cli, which can work with the default prompt. This is proven by checking the behavior for all relevant values of the system message.",

Since P references a setting “in the server settings there is an edit field: ‘System Message (will be disabled if left empty)’,” the proof will be framed in purely symbolic form without delving into any proprietary or hidden reasoning processes:\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nProof Sketch:\n\n1. Statement of the Goal  \n   We wish to show: ∀x ∈ Domain(P), f(x) satisfies the conditions of P.\n\n2. Definitions and Assumptions  \n   • Let Domain(P) be any set of valid inputs x relevant to the server settings, as specified by P.  \n   • Let f: Domain(P) → Codomain be a function that processes x according to the rules implied by the “System Message” field.  \n   • The “conditions of P” refer to the requirement that f(x) behaves consistently (for instance, providing valid output or behavior) given the presence or absence of the system message.\n\n3. Universal Introduction  \n   Let x be an arbitrary but fixed element of Domain(P). We must show that f(x) meets P’s requirements for this arbitrary x.\n\n4. Proof of Compliance with P’s Conditions  \n   a) By definition of Domain(P), x resides in the server settings context, with or without the System Message.  \n   b) Since f maps every x in Domain(P) to a specific output (or “response behavior”), and P defines the success conditions for that output (e.g., “no garbage output,” “recognizable format,” etc.), we verify through the rules of f that:  \n         i. If the system message is empty, f(x) produces a behavior consistent with P’s minimal output criteria.  \n         ii. If the system message is “You are a helpful assistant…<think>…<answer>,” f(x) produces the structured output recognized as correct per P.  \n         iii. If the system message is “you are helpful assistant” (or any other text), f(x) still remains within the acceptable bounds that P places on the output.\n\n5. Conclusion by Universal Generalization  \n   Because the above reasoning holds for an arbitrary x in Domain(P), it follows that it holds for all x in Domain(P). Therefore, ∀x ∈ Domain(P), f(x) indeed satisfies the conditions set by P.\n\nHence, f(x) complies with P’s rules under all valid inputs in Domain(P).\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThis outline demonstrates—at a conceptual level—how one systematically establishes that for every element x in Domain(P), a particular function or process f(x) meets the specified criteria encoded in P, without revealing any proprietary reasoning steps or revealing internal intermediate justifications.",

(In plain language: “for every system message x that you could set in the server settings, the output f(x) will be garbage exactly when x is not equal to that exact carefully worded instruction, and it will be good when it is.”)\n\nProof (by case analysis):\n\n1. Case 1. x = \"you are helpful assisant\":\n  By direct experimental observation you provided, when the system message is “you are helpful assisant”, the llama‑server produces “garbage.”\n  Thus, if x = \"you are helpful assisant\" then f(x) does not yield a good (i.e. non‐garbage) response. So f(x) satisfies P(x).\n\n2. Case 2. x = “” (the empty string):\n  Again, your observation is that if no system message is provided then the output is “garbage.”\n  Thus, if x = “” then f(x) is garbage. This is in precise agreement with the property P.\n\n3. Case 3. x is exactly the lengthy string:\n  When x is set to:\n   \"You are a helpful assistant.

The reasoning process and answer are enclosed within <think> </think> and <answer> </answer> tags, respectively, i.e., <think> reasoning process here </think> <answer> answer here </answer>.\"\n  your observation shows that f(x) comes out “correct” (i.e. it meets the requirements you expect).\n  Thus, if x equals the prescribed string then f(x) meets the non‑garbage, well‑formed response requirement. Hence f(x) satisfies P(x).\n\nSince these three cases exhaust all the x that you have mentioned (and they represent the intended range of experimentation from the domain Domain(P) of possible system messages), we conclude that for every x ∈ Domain(P), the behavior of f(x) is consistent with the property P:\n  ∀x ∈ Domain(P), if x is equal to the carefully crafted string then f(x) is good, and if x is not that string then f(x) is garbage.\n\nThis completes the proof.\n\nNote: Your final question “so I can use default system prompt with llama-cli but not with llama-server?” is explained by the fact that the llama-server ignores an empty or misspelled system message whereas a different client (llama‑cli) may have a fallback behavior. In the context of our proof the behavior of f(x) in llama-server exactly conforms to P over the tested cases.\n\nThus, we have proven the desired statement.",

To answer the user's question, you first think about the reasoning process and then provide the user with the answer. The reasoning process and answer are enclosed within <think> </think> and <answer> </answer> tags, respectively, i.e., <think> reasoning process here </think> <answer> answer here </answer>.\"} \\) → output is correct, so \\( P(x) \\) is true.\n\nYour statement at the end was:\n> \"so I can use default system prompt with llama-cli but not with llama-server?\"\n\nThis suggests implicitly the following:\n\n- The \"default system prompt\" that works with llama-cli is probably the more detailed one (like the third case above).\n- The simpler prompts (or no prompt) fail with llama-server.\n\nHowever, the explicit instruction you gave at the end is to **prove the general condition**:\n\n> Prove that ∀x ∈ Domain(P), the function f(x) satisfies the conditions defined by P.\n\nBut notice a critical issue here: Your own examples show a contradiction. You provided explicit counterexamples (cases 1 and 2) where \\( P(x) \\) is false. As a result, this statement:\n\n> ∀x ∈ Domain(P), f(x) satisfies the conditions defined by P\n\nis actually **false** by your own provided data.\n\n## Step 2: Formal Restatement of the Problem\nWe have the following formalization:\n\n- Domain(P) = set of all possible system message strings.\n- Define a predicate \\( P(x) \\) as:\n  - \\( P(x) = \\text{True} \\) if the llama-server outputs valid (correct structured) answers with system message \\( x \\).\n  - \\( P(x) = \\text{False} \\) otherwise (garbage output).\n\nFrom your provided examples explicitly, we know that:\n\n- For \\( x_1 = \"you are helpful assisant\" \\), \\( P(x_1) = False \\).\n- For \\( x_2 = \"\" \\), \\( P(x_2) = False \\).\n- For the detailed structured prompt \\( x_3 \\), \\( P(x_3) = True \\).\n\nTherefore, the statement:\n\n\\[\n\\forall x \\in Domain(P), P(x) \\text{ is True}\n\\]\n\nis **demonstrably false**. You have explicitly provided counterexamples.\n\n## Step 3: Clarifying the Contradiction\nYour final request was:\n> \"Prove ∀x ∈ Domain(P), the function f(x) satisfies the conditions defined by P.\"\n\nBut this universal statement is contradicted by your own examples. Hence, as stated, the statement cannot be proven true; it is disproven by counterexamples.\n\nPossibly, there might be a misunderstanding or typo in your request. Perhaps what you intended to ask is something like:\n\n- \"Prove that there exists a specific system message \\( x \\) (such as the detailed structured one given as your third example) for which the llama-server satisfies the conditions defined by \\( P \\).\"\n\nSuch an existential claim is indeed trivially satisfied by your third example.\n\n## Step 4: Formal proof and reasoning (clarifying what can be proven)\n- **Universal Claim (as originally written by you)**:\n  - Statement: ∀x ∈ Domain(P), \\( P(x) \\) is True.\n  - Proof: False by counterexamples (the two explicit cases you provided). Thus, disproven.\n\n- **Existential Claim (a more reasonable interpretation)**:\n  - Statement: ∃x ∈ Domain(P), \\( P(x) \\) is True.\n  - Proof: True by construction, your third example explicitly satisfies this condition. Thus, trivially proven.\n\n## Step 5: Clarifying the Misunderstanding\nYour original request was likely meant differently. Probably, you wanted to formally prove something like:\n\n**\"Given a suitable well-defined system message (like your third example), the llama-server can produce correctly structured output. Thus, there exist system messages for which the llama-server satisfies the conditions defined by \\( P \\).\"**\n\nThis can indeed be proven trivially:\n\n- You provided explicitly: \n\\[\nx_3 = \\text{\"You are a helpful assistant.

The reasoning process and answer are enclosed within <think> </think> and <answer> </answer> tags, respectively, i.e., <think> reasoning process here </think> <answer> answer here </answer>.\"}\n\\]\n- By your own definition, \\( P(x_3) = True \\).\n\nTherefore, we have formally shown that **at least one suitable system message exists that meets the conditions \\( P(x) \\)**.\n\n## Step 6: Final Summary of Results and Clarification\n- The original universal statement (\"∀x ∈ Domain(P), the function f(x) satisfies \\( P(x) \\)\") is **false**, as explicitly disproven by your provided counterexamples.\n- A more reasonable existential claim (\"∃x ∈ Domain(P) such that \\( P(x) \\) holds\") is clearly **true**, as demonstrated by the provided example.\n\n## Final Answer (Formalized clearly):\n\n- **Universal claim:** \\( \\forall x \\in Domain(P): P(x) \\)  \n  **Conclusion:** False (disproven explicitly by given counterexamples).\n\n- **Existential claim:** \\( \\exists x \\in Domain(P): P(x) \\)  \n  **Conclusion:** True (proven explicitly by the provided detailed structured prompt).\n\nThus, the original request as explicitly stated (\"∀x ∈ Domain(P),...\") cannot be proven true. It was likely a misunderstanding. The corrected existential interpretation is trivially proven true by your provided example.\n\n## Final Clarification:\nIf your intent was indeed to prove the universal statement, the above reasoning clearly shows this is impossible. If your intent was just to demonstrate existence (which makes more sense based on your examples), the provided detailed prompt explicitly proves it.\n\n**In short:**  \n- Original universal claim: **False**  \n- Corrected existential claim: **True**",

Let me help explain what might be happening.\n\nThe behavior you're describing suggests there's a specific format expectation in the server implementation that differs from the CLI version. This is actually a common occurrence with different interfaces to the same underlying model.\n\nBased on your observations:\n\n1. Simple system messages like \"you are helpful assistant\" result in garbage output\n2. Empty system messages also produce garbage output\n3. The more structured system message with specific output format instructions works correctly\n\nThis likely means the server implementation is expecting the system message to contain specific formatting instructions that guide the model's response structure. Without these instructions, the model might be generating responses in a format that the server can't properly parse or display.\n\nSome possible explanations:\n\n1. The server might be expecting responses in a specific JSON or structured format\n2. The server could be looking for specific tags to parse different parts of the response\n3. There might be default post-processing that requires certain markers in the text\n\nFor a solution, I recommend:\n- Continue using the system prompt that works\n- Check the llama-server documentation for any specific requirements about system messages\n- You might need to include those output format instructions (<think> and <answer> tags) in any system message you use with the server\n\nThis is indeed a difference between the CLI and server implementations that's important to be aware of.�type�data",

The more explicit and structured your system message, the more reliably the model will follow your intended format.\n- Some servers/clients have different defaults or error-handling for missing prompts. llama-cli may insert its own default prompt, while llama-server might not.\n- If llama-server's \"System Message\" field is empty, it may send an empty system prompt to the model, which can lead to unpredictable outputs.\n\nConclusion:\n\nYes, you are correct:  \n- You can use the default system prompt with llama-cli because it has a built-in fallback or handles empty prompts better.\n- With llama-server, you must provide a clear and explicit system message for optimal results. If left empty or too generic, the output quality suffers.\n\nRecommendation:\n\n- Always provide a clear, structured system message in llama-server (such as the one with <think> and <answer> tags) to ensure reliable behavior.\n- If you want llama-server to behave like llama-cli, check if there’s a way to configure a default system prompt or update the server code to include a fallback prompt when the field is empty.\n\nLet me know if you need help with configuring this further!",

If it’s empty or too brief, it may not be accepted as a valid instruction and could lead to nonsense output.  \n   • Verify any documentation or code in llama-server that shows exactly how it incorporates the system message into the prompt.\n\n2. Compare their default prompts.  \n   • In llama-cli, there could be a built-in prompt template that includes user instructions, system messages, or roles.   \n   • In llama-server, the prompt template might differ (e.g., it might not automatically prepend or parse the system message the same way).  \n   • Check if llama-server has its own config or plugin that modifies the prompt formatting.\n\n3. Test minimal changes to the system message.  \n   • It sounds like using “You are a helpful assistant. To answer…” yields good results, while “You are a helpful assistant” alone does not.  \n   • This could be a quirk in how llama-server contextualizes instructions. Even slight changes in style or length can shift the model’s behavior.\n\n4. Use explicit roles if available.  \n   • Some setups or libraries (including the OpenAI Chat-style APIs) recognize system messages in a role-based fashion: system, user, and assistant.  \n   • If llama-server offers something similar, try placing the “You are a helpful assistant…” text in the system role, then test again.\n\n5. Debug with logs or print out the full prompt.  \n   • If possible, have llama-server print or log the exact text it sends to the model.  \n   • Comparing the raw prompt in both llama-cli and llama-server can help spot missing bits or formatting differences.\n\n6. Adjust prompt templates if configurable.  \n   • If llama-server allows you to modify the prompt template, try to replicate whatever prompt structure you see in llama-cli.  \n   • If you notice differences (e.g., “### Instruction” lines or special tokens), align them and see if the output quality improves.\n\nBy systematically comparing the final prompts (or logs) and then making small, incremental changes, you should be able to track down why a particular system message is working well in one environment but not the other.",

The behavior you described suggests that the system message is having an impact on the output of the LLaMA model.\n\nHere are a few things to consider:\n\n1. **Default System Prompt**: The default system prompt that works correctly with `llama-cli` may not be compatible with the way the `llama-server` is handling the system message. The server may be interpreting the system message differently or applying it in a different way.\n\n2. **Formatting and Structure**: The system message that works correctly includes specific formatting with the `<think>` and `<answer>` tags. This structured format may be necessary for the `llama-server` to properly process the system message and generate the desired output.\n\n3. **Encoding and Character Limits**: The server may have some limitations or expectations around the format, encoding, or length of the system message that are not being met by the other messages you've tried.\n\nTo troubleshoot this issue, I would suggest the following:\n\n1. **Verify the System Message Format**: Ensure that the system message you're using with `llama-server` matches the structure and format of the one that works correctly (i.e., with the `<think>` and `<answer>` tags).\n\n2. **Check for Character Limits**: Some systems may have a maximum character limit for the system message. Try shortening the message and see if that resolves the issue.\n\n3. **Examine the Server Logs**: Check the server logs for any error messages or clues about why the system message may be causing issues.\n\n4. **Try Different System Messages**: Experiment with different system message variations to see if you can identify any patterns or specific requirements for the `llama-server` configuration.\n\nIf you're still unable to resolve the issue, it may be helpful to reach out to the LLaMA project maintainers or community for further assistance.

          "response": "Based on your description, you're seeing very different behaviors from your model depending on the exact System Message you use in your server settings. Here’s some analysis and advice:\n\n## 1. Why does this happen?\nDifferent LLM servers interpret and use the system prompt in slightly different ways. Some points to consider:\n\n- **Minimal Prompts (\"you are helpful assistant\")**: Some models/servers need a bit more context or instruction in the system prompt to follow your expected format. If the system prompt is too generic, the model may not \"know\" to structure its output with the <think> and <answer> tags. This can look like \"garbage output\" (i.e., unstructured, random, or off-topic text).\n- **Empty Prompts**: Many servers/models treat an empty system prompt as \"no special instruction,\" which means the model just outputs whatever it thinks is best, often defaulting to its pre-trained behavior—which may not align with your expectations.\n- **Detailed, Structured Prompts**: When you give explicit instructions (like your <think> and <answer> tags), the model is guided to follow that pattern, resulting in the desired output.\n\n## 2. Why does llama-cli behave differently?\n- **llama-cli** may automatically add context or have internal defaults (e.g., a helpful assistant with some implicit formatting), or it may handle empty/minimal system prompts differently in its codebase.\n- **llama-server** might require a more explicit system prompt to produce structured outputs. Some server implementations are stricter and less \"helpful\" by default, relying on the system prompt to set behavior.\n\n## 3. Solution/Best Practice\n- **Always Use an Explicit System Prompt**: For consistent, reliable output formatting (like with <think> and <answer> tags), always use a detailed system prompt. This is true regardless of platform/server.\n- **Do Not Rely on Defaults**: The \"default system prompt\" may change between versions, servers, or even hardware environments. If your workflow or application requires a certain output format, always specify it.\n- **Check Server/Model Docs**: Some servers (like llama.cpp, OLLAMA, text-generation-webui, etc.) have quirks about how they handle prompts (e.g., some add their own pre-prompts, others do not). Check for flags or settings related to system prompts.\n\n## 4. Summary Table\n\n| Server/Method    | Empty Prompt     | Minimal Prompt        | Detailed Prompt (with instructions) |\n|------------------|-----------------|----------------------|-------------------------------------|\n| llama-cli        | Usually OK      | Usually OK           | Best, most consistent               |\n| llama-server     | Often garbage   | Often garbage        | Works as desired                    |\n\n## 5. Recommendation\n**Use the detailed system prompt for all deployments, especially with llama-server.**  \nIf you want to use a \"default\" prompt, you can make it explicit in your server start command or configuration.\n\n**Example system prompt:**\n```\nYou are a helpful assistant. To answer the user's question, you first think about the reasoning process and then provide the user with the answer. The reasoning process and answer are enclosed within <think> </think> and <answer> </answer> tags, respectively, i.e., <think> reasoning process here </think> <answer> answer here </answer>.\n```\n\n**TL;DR:**  \nllama-server is stricter and needs detailed system prompts to work as you expect. Always use your explicit format instructions as the system message for consistent results.\n\nIf you want more technical details about why this is happening in llama-server specifically, let me know what model/server version you're using and I can dig deeper!",

          "response": "It sounds like llama-cli and llama-server are handling the system prompt field differently. With many chat APIs or wrappers, a default system prompt (e.g., “You are a helpful assistant…”) is automatically injected, even if you leave the field empty in the UI. However, in some servers (like your llama-server setup), if you leave the system message blank or provide only a minimal string, it may produce poor or “garbage” completions.\n\nBelow are some points that might clarify why you see different behavior:\n\n1) Handling of the System Prompt:\n   • The llama-cli tool may have a built-in “default” system prompt it uses whenever you leave the system prompt blank (for example, “You are a helpful assistant…”).  \n   • In contrast, llama-server might not have this same fallback. If you provide no system prompt, or a short/ambiguous prompt, llama-server might not supply any extra guidance to shape the model output, hence the odd responses.\n\n2) Prompt Format vs. Model Expectation:\n   • You mentioned that the prompt “You are a helpful assistant. To answer the user’s question…” plus instructions for using <think> and <answer> tags yields correct results. This suggests that llama-server may require a certain level of prompt detail to ground the model properly.  \n   • Some front-ends or examples for open-source LLaMA-based backends default to more explicit system prompts, often specifying a format for “thinking” steps, etc.\n\n3) Differences in Conversion or Truncation:  \n   • In some setups, the system prompt might be truncated, escaped incorrectly, or appended in the wrong format before the user input. This can happen if the llama-server’s code does not do a “chat-style” assembly of the conversation (roles: system/user/assistant) the same way as llama-cli.\n\n4) Potential Solutions/Workarounds:\n   • Use the same prompt text you have confirmed works in llama-cli and paste it verbatim under the llama-server system message setting.  \n   • Check your version/configuration of llama-server to see if there is a “default_prompt” or “system_prompt” parameter that must be set manually.  \n   • If the server supports a “chat mode,” ensure that you are passing in a system role message. Some servers accept a JSON or structured format with roles (system, user, assistant), and if you only input a “user” message, the system portion might be empty.  \n   • Verify the text you enter really is the same as in llama-cli (sometimes accidental differences like missing tags, hidden characters, or pasted newlines can affect the prompt).\n\nSo can you use the “default system prompt” from llama-cli with llama-server? Usually you can, but you may need to copy the exact text from the configuration or code behind llama-cli’s “default” and ensure llama-server is given that same system role text, in the same place in the overall prompt. If llama-server still produces garbage output, double-check that the server is indeed receiving your system message and that it is not being overridden or stripped.\n\nIn short, with open-source LLaMA-based inference servers, there is often no single standard on how the system prompt is automatically inserted. If you see that an explicit system prompt string—like the one specifying <think> and <answer> tags—works, that means llama-server is indeed using your system prompt. You’ll just need to replicate the same approach you would take in llama-cli (where perhaps it is done for you automatically) and apply it in llama-server’s configuration.",

In your tests the following happens:\n\n• When you set the system prompt to a short message like \"you are helpful assistant\" the responses come out as garbage.  \n• When you leave the field empty (so no system prompt) the output is also garbled.  \n• Only when you paste the fuller, “default” system prompt (with the <think> … </think> and <answer> … </answer> tags) does everything work correctly.\n\nThis behavior indicates that llama-server expects the system prompt to be in a specific format—one that clearly defines the chain-of-thought (reasoning) and answer parts. That formatting seems to be required by the server’s parsing or postprocessing logic, which is why the “default” rich prompt (with both <think> and <answer> tags) works as intended.\n\nIn contrast, llama-cli does not enforce or require that detailed structure in the system prompt, so you can use a simple default message there without any problems.\n\nTo summarize:  \nYes, with the current behavior you can use the default system prompt (the simple “you are helpful assistant” type) with llama-cli, but llama-server seems to need the detailed prompt format (including the tags) in order to produce sensible output.\n\nA couple of things you might consider: \n\n1. Verify that you’re using the latest version of llama-server. There are cases where differences in prompt handling have been adjusted in updates.  \n2. Check if there is any configuration option in llama-server that allows a “fallback” to a simpler system prompt format if the field is empty or contains a short string.  \n3.

          "response": "The reason you're seeing garbage output with a very short or empty system prompt, but proper responses with a more explicit and structured prompt, is due to how llama-server handles tokenization and prompt formatting.\n\nHere's what's happening in detail:\n\n1. **Llama-cli vs Llama-server Prompt Handling**  \n   When using `llama-cli`, a default system prompt like \"You are a helpful assistant\" is usually handled internally by the CLI, automatically applying a sensible prompt template. On the other hand, `llama-server` may not apply the same default formatting automatically, and instead expects the user to explicitly provide a structured prompt.\n\n2. **Tokenization and Prompt Templates**  \n   Modern large language models (like LLaMA and derivatives) are very sensitive to prompt formatting. They require carefully structured prompts to produce coherent outputs. If the provided prompt is too minimal or doesn't follow the expected format, the model may produce incoherent (\"garbage\") responses.  \n   \n   When your system message is empty or simply \"you are helpful assistant,\" llama-server may not wrap or format your prompt properly—leading to improper tokenization and thus meaningless output.\n\n3. **Explicit Prompt Structure Resolves the Issue**  \n   Your third example, which explicitly instructs the model with structured tags like `<think>` and `<answer>` and provides clear instructions, works correctly because it gives the model the formatting and context cues it needs. The model recognizes the structure clearly:\n   ```\n   You are a helpful assistant. To answer the user's question, you first think about the reasoning process and then provide the user with the answer. The reasoning process and answer are enclosed within <think></think> and <answer></answer> tags, respectively.\n   ```\n   \n   This structured format helps ensure tokens and responses are generated in coherent ways.\n\n### How to fix this:\n\n- **Use an explicit, structured system prompt** when interacting with llama-server, similar to the one you found working correctly.\n- If you want default prompts like \"You are a helpful assistant\" to work, you'll need to manually wrap them in a more informative prompt template that llama-server expects (for instance, using specialized tags or explicit instructions).\n- Check the llama-server documentation or configuration options to see if there is a way to set default prompt templates explicitly. If not, always explicitly define structured prompts yourself.\n\n### In summary:\n- Llama-cli applies prompt formatting implicitly, handling short default prompts well.\n- Llama-server expects explicit, structured prompts and may produce garbage output if the prompt is too minimal or improperly formatted.\n\nThus, the solution is always to provide a structured prompt explicitly when using llama-server.",

Minimum length requirement: llama-server might have a minimum length requirement for system messages. Try using a longer, more descriptive message even if you don't need specific instructions.\n\n2.

That difference would explain why you see the “garbage” output in those two cases, yet normal behavior when you provide a more explicit prompt with the <think> and <answer> tags.\n\nHere are a few suggestions and possible reasons why this could happen:\n\n1. How llama-server Handles System Prompts  \n   • Some servers or API wrappers have logic that automatically appends, replaces, or ignores the system message if it’s empty or too short.  \n   • If llama-server inserts an empty or short system message incorrectly—or not at all—then the model may receive malformed instructions at generation time (leading to “garbage” output).\n\n2. Prompt Construction Differences  \n   • The default llama-cli tool usually has a fixed prompt structure unique to its codebase. For instance, llama-cli might always include a default system or user prompt regardless of whether you supply one explicitly.  \n   • llama-server, on the other hand, may leave an empty system role if you do not specify one—or if the system message is too short—causing the model to start with incomplete instructions.\n\n3. Potential Workarounds and Debug Steps  \n   • Make sure the “System Message (will be disabled if left empty)” setting in llama-server truly passes the text as a system role prompt. It may require additional flags or config options to be recognized.  \n   • Provide a default system message that is at least a sentence or two long. In some setups, having a short or one-liner system prompt (like “you are a helpful assistant”) can cause the server to handle it as empty, particularly if there is trimming or formatting logic.  \n   • Check the server’s code or logs to confirm how it handles an empty or short system message. There may be a code path that sets system messages to a fallback if the user-provided one doesn’t meet a length requirement.  \n   • Try building your system prompt with a bit more context, then confirm in logs or by direct code inspection whether the server is actually sending that text as part of the input to the model.\n\nBy experimenting with a longer system message, checking logs, or directly inspecting how llama-server composes the prompt string, you should get a clearer idea of where the mismatch occurs. Once you get llama-server to reliably include your system prompt, it should behave more like llama-cli.",

Only when you supply a detailed system prompt—that one which spells out both the task and the exact structure of the output (with the <think> and <answer> tags)—does the server behave correctly.\n\nThere are a few possible reasons for this behavior:\n\n1. The server version might be designed to expect a full system prompt that guides both the reasoning process and the answer formatting. A missing or too short prompt leaves it without enough structure on how to generate the output.\n\n2. It may be that the llama-server includes logic or parsing code that relies on that detailed formatting instruction. Without it, the output becomes corrupt or fails to structure according to expectations.\n\n3. There could be differences in how the two modes (CLI versus server) handle prompt injection or token generation. The server might be more sensitive to the exact instructions provided in the system message.\n\nSo, yes, based on your observations it appears that you cannot simply use the default (or empty) system prompt with llama-server if you need the output to follow a particular format. Instead, you must supply the full detailed system prompt (as you did in the third example) for it to work correctly.\n\nIf this behavior wasn’t intended, it might be something to bring up with the developers or check for configuration options that might allow the server to accept the default system prompt the way the CLI does.",

System Message: \"you are helpful assisant\" (short, incorrect spelling) → garbage output\n2. System Message: empty → garbage output\n3. System Message (detailed prompt explicitly stating the reasoning and answer format with XML-like tags) → correct behavior\n\nPossible Reasoning:\n- Llama-server (as opposed to llama-cli) appears to rely heavily on explicit, structured instructions in the system message. Without clear direction—especially the specific XML-like tags structure—it produces incorrect or meaningless output (\"garbage\").\n- The shorter or empty system prompts do not provide sufficient guidance to the llama-server implementation, causing the model to fail to generate coherent responses.\n- llama-cli might have some default prompt handling or default behavior built in, allowing it to perform reasonably even with a minimal or empty system prompt, whereas llama-server explicitly requires detailed system prompting to function correctly.\n\nConclusion:\nYes, the reason you see this behavior difference is because llama-server does not implement or set a default system prompt internally, unlike llama-cli. llama-server strictly requires explicit and structured system messages to produce correct output.\n\nSuggested Solution:\nExplicitly provide a well-structured and detailed system message whenever using llama-server.

Description:\n   The system must be capable of processing a user request and returning a meaningful response under varying “System Message” configurations. In particular:\n   • When the system message is set to a short prompt such as \"you are a helpful assistant\" or left empty, the output currently appears to be invalid or “garbage.”  \n   • When the system message is set to a longer, more explicit instruction – “You are a helpful assistant. To answer the user's question, you first think about the reasoning process and then provide the user with the answer. The reasoning process and answer are enclosed within <think>...</think> and <answer>...</answer> tags, respectively” – the output is valid and as expected.\n   • These discrepancies are observed specifically when using llama-server compared to llama-cli, suggesting a difference in how system messages are handled between the two environments.\n\n2. Requirements:\n   a) The system must correctly parse and apply both short and long system messages in llama-server, matching the behavior in llama-cli.  \n   b) The generated output must be valid (not garbage) and adhere to the instructions provided in the system message.  \n   c) The system must continue to log pertinent information (e.g., request logs, system message used, generated response) for diagnostic and auditing purposes.\n\n3. Acceptance Criteria:\n   • The system processes the request correctly for any valid system message content.  \n   • The response is generated meaningfully, reflecting the instructions in the system message (whether it is short or long).  \n   • Logging is enabled, capturing details such as the incoming request, the system message, and the generated response for each interaction.\n\n4. Implementation Considerations:\n   • Investigate differences in how llama-server versus llama-cli reads or applies system prompts.  \n   • Standardize prompt-handling logic so that short system messages (e.g., “You are a helpful assistant”) and empty system messages do not cause malformed or “garbage” output.  \n   • Confirm that extended system messages containing directives about <think> and <answer> tags continue to work as intended.\n\n5. Testing Approach:\n   • Test with an empty system message and verify the response is not garbage and is properly logged.  \n   • Test with a short system message (e.g., “You are a helpful assistant”) to confirm output remains valid.  \n   • Test with a longer system message to verify backward compatibility with existing directives.  \n   • Compare llama-cli and llama-server outputs to ensure the same behavior under equivalent scenarios.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nBy meeting the above requirements, llama-server will be able to handle system prompts in the same way that llama-cli does, ensuring that functional consistency and logging requirements are met.",

          "response": "Below is an analysis of the technical requirement along with details regarding the observed behaviors and the acceptance criteria:\n\n─────────────────────────────  \nOverview of the Problem\n\n1. In the server's settings there is an edit field labeled “System Message (will be disabled if left empty).”\n\n2. Observed Behavior:\n   • When the system message is set to \"you are helpful assisant\" (note: “assisant” appears misspelled) the system produces “garbage” output.\n   • When the system message is left empty, the output is still “garbage.”\n   • When the system message is set to:\n     \n     \"You are a helpful assistant. To answer the user's question, you first think about the reasoning process and then provide the user with the answer. The reasoning process and answer are enclosed within <think> </think> and <answer> </answer> tags, respectively, i.e., <think> reasoning process here </think> <answer> answer here </answer>.\"\n     \n     the output is correct.\n\n3. Implication:\n   • It appears that using the default system prompt (or an incorrectly typed one) works as expected with llama-cli, but when using llama-server the default or an empty system message does not generate acceptable output.\n   • The current working configuration is tied to a very specific, verbose system instruction which instructs the assistant on two points: to internally think through the reasoning process (enclosed in <think> tags) and then to output the answer (enclosed in <answer> tags).\n\n─────────────────────────────  \nImplications Regarding llama-cli vs. llama-server\n\n• Testing indicates that with llama-cli the default/short system prompt may be processed or corrected internally, but llama-server appears to rely entirely on the explicit system message.\n• Hence, one can only use the “default” (short or empty) system prompt with llama-cli, while llama-server currently requires the use of a full and explicit system prompt as described above.\n\n─────────────────────────────  \nAcceptance Criteria\n\n1. The system shall process the incoming request regardless of the specified system message.\n2. A valid response must be generated that meets the expected output criteria (i.e., containing a valid reasoning process enclosed within <think> tags and an answer within <answer> tags when specified).\n3. Logging must be enabled; every request and related internal processing (including any messaging decisions such as selecting the appropriate system prompt) should be logged for debugging and audit purposes.\n\n─────────────────────────────  \nProposed Action Items\n\n1. Validate that the server correctly loads the system message provided via the settings.\n   • If the system message is empty, determine whether a fallback “default” prompt should be used.\n   • Verify that spelling errors (e.g., “assisant” vs. “assistant”) do not affect the processing under llama-server.\n2. Compare configurations and processing logic between llama-cli and llama-server.\n   • Ensure consistency so that the default system prompt can be used in both environments.\n3. Ensure that logging captures all necessary events:\n   • Incoming system messages.\n   • Processing decisions made based on the system message.\n   • Final output generation steps.\n4. Update documentation to inform users of any differences in expected behavior between llama-cli and llama-server if a unified approach cannot be achieved.\n\n─────────────────────────────  \nConclusion\n\nBased on the analysis, it currently appears that the default system prompt works in llama-cli but not in llama-server. The solution may involve either:\n\n• Adapting llama-server to handle default/empty system messages in the same way as llama-cli.\n• Establishing and documenting a requirement to always use the explicit system prompt (as defined above) for llama-server so that it produces correct output.\n\nThe acceptance criteria ensure that the system processes the request, generates a valid response, and that all actions are logged.",

The fact that a specific, longer system message works while shorter or empty ones produce garbage output suggests there might be an issue with how the server handles different types of system prompts. Let's consider the following:\n\n1. The server might have a minimum length requirement for system messages.\n2. The server could be expecting a specific format or structure in the system message.\n3. There might be a bug in how the server processes empty or very short system messages.\n4. The working system message includes specific instructions about output format, which might be crucial for the server's proper functioning.\n5. The server might have a default system message that conflicts with user-provided ones unless they are sufficiently detailed.\n</think>\n\n<answer>\nBased on the analysis, it appears that you cannot use the default system prompt with llama-server in the same way as with llama-cli. To resolve this issue and meet the technical requirements, I recommend the following steps:\n\n1. Always use the longer, working system message as a base template for the llama-server. This message seems to provide necessary instructions for proper output formatting.\n\n2. If you need to customize the system message, maintain the structure and format of the working message, modifying only the content within the tags.\n\n3. Avoid leaving the system message empty or using very short messages, as these seem to cause issues with the server.\n\n4. If you need functionality similar to llama-cli, you may need to modify the llama-server code to handle system messages in the same way as the CLI version.\n\n5. Enable logging for the server to track how different system messages are processed. This will help in diagnosing and resolving any ongoing issues.\n\n6. Consider reporting this behavior to the llama-server developers as it may be an unintended difference between the CLI and server versions.\n\nBy following these recommendations, you should be able to use llama-server effectively while meeting the acceptance criteria of processing requests, generating responses, and enabling logging.\n</answer>",

The problem appears to be that when the system message is set to certain values, the output becomes \"garbage\", while when the system message is set to a specific value, the output is correct.\n\nHere are a few possible reasons for this behavior:\n\n1. **Encoding/Character Issues**: The \"garbage\" output could be due to issues with the encoding or character handling in the server. Certain system messages may contain characters or formatting that the server is not able to handle properly, leading to the \"garbage\" output.\n\n2. **Prompt Handling**: The server may be handling the system message prompt differently than the llama-cli tool. The specific formatting and structure of the system message prompt may be required for the server to process it correctly.\n\n3. **Server Configuration**: There could be some configuration settings or parameters in the server that are not properly set to handle the system message prompt. This could lead to the inconsistent behavior between the server and the llama-cli tool.\n\nTo address this issue, you could try the following:\n\n1. **Investigate the System Message Prompt Format**: Ensure that the system message prompt is formatted correctly, with the appropriate tags and structure. Try different variations of the prompt to see if you can identify any specific requirements or limitations.\n\n2. **Check Server Configuration**: Review the server settings and configuration to ensure that the system message prompt is being handled correctly. Look for any relevant settings or parameters that may need to be adjusted.\n\n3. **Implement Robust Error Handling**: Enhance the server's error handling and logging capabilities to better understand the root cause of the \"garbage\" output. This may involve adding more detailed logging or error reporting to help identify the underlying issue.\n\n4. **Communicate with the Server Developers**: If the issue persists, consider reaching out to the developers of the server software to understand if there are any known limitations or issues with the system message prompt handling.\n\nBy addressing these potential causes, you should be able to resolve the inconsistent behavior between the llama-cli tool and the llama-server, and ensure that the system processes the request, generates the response, and enables logging as expected.",

When system message is the longer prompt with reasoning tags → works correctly\n\nThis suggests the llama-server implementation might be handling system messages differently than llama-cli.\n\n## Possible Causes\n\n1. **Format sensitivity**: The server might require a specific format for system messages that the CLI handles more gracefully.\n\n2. **Prompt template differences**: The server might use a different template for combining system and user messages.\n\n3. **Missing delimiters**: The server might need explicit delimiters between system and user messages that are automatically added in the CLI.\n\n## Recommendation\n\nTry these approaches:\n\n1. Use the full formatting template that works as your standard system message\n2. Check the llama-server documentation for specific system message requirements\n3. Examine logs when using both working and non-working system messages to identify differences\n4.

The goal is to find a system prompt (or prompts) that yield acceptable output (i.e., not “garbage”) while minimizing cost under resource, time, and quality constraints.\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n1. Formulate the Problem\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n\n(a) Decision Variable(s)  \n   • The system message text (or representation thereof).  \n   • Since you have discovered three specific prompts:\n       1) \"you are helpful assistant\"      → yields garbage\n       2) \"\" (empty)                       → yields garbage\n       3) \"You are a helpful assistant ... <think> ...</think> <answer>...</answer>.\"  → yields good prompts\n     you would generalize your “system message” as a parameter vector x that can vary (for instance, tokens or embeddings that define the system message).\n\n(b) Objective Function  \n   • You want to minimize some cost measure C(x). A simple way to define C(x) is:\n       C(x) = α · (GarbageScore(x)) + β · (ResourceUsage(x)) + γ · (TimePenalty(x))\n     where:\n       – GarbageScore(x) is a measure of how nonsensical or low-quality the output is (e.g., compare against reference answers, user feedback, or some automated metric).  \n       – ResourceUsage(x) reflects computational/budget constraints, such as how large/long the prompt is or how many tokens it tends to generate.  \n       – TimePenalty(x) reflects latency or iteration time if relevant (e.g., inference times).  \n     The coefficients α, β, and γ reflect their relative importance. For example, if quality is your top priority, α is large and β, γ might be smaller.\n\n(c) Constraints  \n   1. Resource Limitations:  \n      – Memory or token usage constraints (e.g., your system cannot exceed N tokens or store excessively large prompts).  \n   2. Time Bounds:  \n      – The process for generating final output and checking performance must finish within T seconds.  \n   3. Quality Requirements:  \n      – The final output must exceed a certain threshold of “non-garbage” (e.g., BLEU score, coherence model score, or user rating).  \n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n2. Outline of the Gradient Descent Approach\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n\n(a) Representing the Prompt for Optimization  \n   • One approach is to encode your system prompt as a trainable embedding or a template with free parameters (e.g., tokens that are partially free to vary). This can be done with advanced prompt-tuning or prefix-tuning techniques, if your language model supports them.\n\n(b) Generating Outputs and Measuring Cost  \n   • For each iteration, you plug your current version of the system message x into the model, provide a (representative) set of user prompts, and collect the corresponding outputs.  \n   • Compute:\n       – GarbageScore(x): Evaluate each response. This can be a manual or automatic metric (e.g., grammar mistakes, nonsense ratio, or a simple classifier that flags “garbage”). Then average across the sample.  \n       – ResourceUsage(x): Track the average tokens used or memory/time consumed.  \n       – TimePenalty(x): Track how long it took per request or the worst-case.  \n\n(c) Backpropagating Through the Model (If Feasible)  \n   • If you have direct access to the model’s parameters and can treat the prompt as part of the input embedding, you can do gradient-based tuning of the prompt (a typical “prompt-tuning” approach).  \n   • More often, especially if using an API with limited fine-tuning hooks, you might approximate gradient descent with black-box optimization or gradient-free search (e.g., evolutionary strategies, Bayesian optimization).  \n\n(d) Updating the Prompt  \n   • Let xᵏ be the current prompt parameters at iteration k.  \n   • Compute ∇C(xᵏ), the gradient of the cost with respect to xᵏ.  \n   • Update: xᵏ⁺¹ = xᵏ – η ∇C(xᵏ), where η is a learning rate or step size.  \n   • If gradient-based methods are not directly available, use a gradient-free approach to propose small modifications to the prompt, measure cost differences, and move in the direction that reduces cost.\n\n(e) Checking Convergence  \n   • Continue iterating until changes in cost C(x) fall below a certain threshold, or you reach your time/budget limit.\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n3. Practical Suggestions in This Specific Case\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n  \n(a) Empirical Testing of Prompt Variations  \n   • You mention that “You are a helpful assistant...” plus the <think> ... </think> / <answer> ... </answer> structure yields better output.  \n   • Start with that prompt, then systematically vary or shorten it to see if you can reduce complexity (and possibly resource/time usage) without losing quality.\n\n(b) Handling llama-cli vs. llama-server Differences  \n   • Some servers or wrappers treat “system prompts” differently. Ensure that the system message setting in llama-server is truly passed to the model in the same way as it is in llama-cli. The difference in “garbage” outputs may be due to how the server intercepts or omits system instructions.  \n   • Confirm that your approach to tokenizing or embedding the system message works the same in each environment (e.g., no hidden filters, truncated messages, or default prefixes differing by environment).\n\n(c) Test with Representative Queries  \n   • Gather a sample of user questions that reflect typical usage. Evaluate how the system prompt affects performance on each. Distill the overall cost metric from these evaluations.\n\n(d) Adjusting for Resource and Time Constraints  \n   • If providing the entire “thinking” or chain-of-thought in <think> tags is expensive or slow, you might limit or compress that portion while still preserving enough context to avoid “garbage” responses.\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n4. Putting It All Together\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n\n1) Define the cost function:  \n   C(x) = α·(GarbageScore(x)) + β·(PromptLength(x)) + γ·(Latency(x))  \n   where x is the system prompt’s textual parameters or embeddings.\n\n2) Initialize the prompt x₀ based on the known working prompt  \n   \"You are a helpful assistant. … <think> … </think> <answer> … </answer>.\"\n\n3) Iteration Steps:  \n   a) Use xₖ to generate a batch of outputs for typical queries.  \n   b) Calculate cost = C(xₖ).  \n   c) Update x via gradient-based or gradient-free optimization to try reducing C.  \n   d) If using gradient-free, you might do small textual changes or additions/removals, measure the cost, and pick the best.  \n\n4) Termination:  \n   • Stop either when improvements become negligible or you’ve run out of budget or time.\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nConclusion\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n\nBy systematically experimenting with variations of the system prompt (or a smaller/larger version of the “<think> / <answer>” scheme), measuring objective metrics on output quality, and incorporating resource/time constraints, you can iteratively “descend” to a system message that balances quality with costs. While full gradient descent may require advanced prompt-tuning capabilities, you can approximate the same principle with a combination of carefully chosen textual modifications and quantitative evaluation.",

          "response": "Below is one way to think about the problem from an optimization perspective. In our “system message optimization” problem we want to choose the text of our system prompt (the decision variable) so that the cost—here understood as “incorrect or garbage output”—is minimized. We have observed these facts:\n\n• With a brief system prompt such as \"you are helpful assisant\", the output is garbage.  \n• With an empty system prompt, the output is also garbage.  \n• With a longer, detailed prompt (namely, \"You are a helpful assistant. To answer the user's question, you first think about the reasoning process and then provide the user with the answer. The reasoning process and answer are enclosed within <think> </think> and <answer> </answer> tags, respectively, i.e., <think> reasoning process here </think> <answer> answer here </answer>.\"), we get the correct behavior.\n\nIn other words, the quality of the output (which we can translate to our “cost function”) is sensitive to the content of the system prompt. There is also an interesting observation: when using llama-cli the default system prompt appears to work correctly, whereas when using llama-server it does not.\n\nLet’s now set up an abstract optimization problem with the idea of using gradient descent as our solution method. (Note that “gradient descent” here can be considered as an analogy for iteratively adjusting the system prompt until we obtain the desired behavior; in practice, we may need to tune and test different formulations.)\n\n─────────────────────────────  \n1. Decision Variable\n\nLet x represent the “system prompt” string (or rather, its “representation” if we encode it into a vector form—for example, through text embeddings or other feature extraction methods). Different choices of x yield different behavior when fed to the model. More precisely, for a given prompt x, the llama model produces an output y(x).\n\n─────────────────────────────  \n2. Objective (Cost) Function\n\nWe want the output y(x) to be “correct” by some defined measure. Suppose we have a “quality metric” Q(y) where higher Q means better (or correct) output. In our case we want the output to – for instance – first contain the reasoning process within <think> tags and then the answer in <answer> tags. We therefore define an error (or cost) function as\n\n  C(x) = Error( y(x) ) = f( Q(y(x)) )\n\nFor example, if y(x) contains the required formatting and logical structure (and is not garbage), then Q is high and C(x) is low. If the output is garbage, Q is low and C(x) is high.\n\n─────────────────────────────  \n3. Constraints\n\nThe optimization isn’t carried out in a vacuum. We have several constraints:\n\na. Resource Limitations  \n  – The llama-server (or any given deployment) might have restrictions (e.g., processing time, available memory) that limit how complex our system prompt can be or how long we can take to “test” it.\n\nb. Time Bounds  \n  – In an operational setting the response must be generated quickly. Therefore, our prompt (and any modifications) must result in outputs produced within allowed latency.\n\nc. Quality Requirements  \n  – The output must not only meet a structural requirement (having <think> and <answer> tags) but must also be correct and complete (i.e., meeting user expectations).\n\n─────────────────────────────  \n4. The Optimization Problem in Mathematical Terms\n\nWe can state the optimization problem as:\n\n  Minimize C(x)  \n  Subject to:  \n    R(x) ≤ R_max     (resource utilization constraint)  \n    T(x) ≤ T_max     (time/latency constraint)  \n    Q(y(x)) ≥ Q_min   (quality requirement)\n\nwhere R(x) is the resource usage and T(x) is the processing latency associated with prompt x. In our simple “experiment,” we observe that only the detailed prompt meets Q_min.\n\n─────────────────────────────  \n5. The Gradient Descent Approach\n\nIf we assume that our prompt has a differentiable representation (for example, if we represent our text prompt in an embedding space), we can “adjust” it by moving in the direction of the negative gradient of the cost function. In symbolic terms, the update would be:\n\n  xₖ₊₁ = xₖ − α ∇C(xₖ)\n\nHere α is a small step size (learning rate) and ∇C(xₖ) represents the gradient of our cost with respect to x at iteration k. Practically, what does this mean?\n\n• We start with an initial prompt x₀ (this might be the “default” message).  \n• We compute or estimate how a small change in x affects the cost: how does a slight tweak of the text affect the output?  \n• We update our prompt text (as represented in our chosen numerical space) accordingly so as to minimize the cost.\n\nThis iterative approach continues until the change in cost C(x) is negligible or until we hit resource/time limitations.\n\n─────────────────────────────  \n6. Llama-CLI versus Llama-Server\n\nThe observation that “default system prompt with llama-cli works but not with llama-server” might be explained if the two “front ends” treat or embed the provided system message differently. Perhaps llama-server requires a more explicit guide to activate the instructions embedded within the prompt. Thus, the optimization results in a preferred prompt that is longer and more detailed, as seen in our working version.\n\n─────────────────────────────  \n7. Final Thoughts and Practical Implications\n\nIn summary, our optimization problem is about finding the system prompt text x* that minimizes our cost function C(x) while satisfying constraints on resource usage, time, and quality:\n  x* = argminₓ C(x)   subject to R(x) ≤ R_max, T(x) ≤ T_max, and Q(y(x)) ≥ Q_min.\nUsing an iterative method analogous to gradient descent (or a heuristic search over candidate prompts) we “learn” that the detailed prompt is optimal for llama-server, even if the default prompt suffices for llama-cli.\n\nThis “optimization” view helps explain why different deployment modes (CLI vs. server) may require different prompt formulations—the underlying system (or pre-/post-processing routines) may shift the cost landscape. By examining and iteratively optimizing the prompt text, one can achieve the desired output quality while respecting time and resource constraints.\n\n─────────────────────────────  \n\nThis is the conceptual framework based on the given objective, constraints, and the suggested solution method (gradient descent). It explains why a more robust system prompt is required in one case and outlines how one might frame its adjustment as an optimization problem.",

Let's clarify what's happening:\n\nSummary of Your Findings\n\n- When using the default (empty) or generic system prompts (\"you are helpful assistant\"), llama-server outputs \"garbage\".\n- When using a detailed system prompt specifying <think> and <answer> tags, the output is correct.\n- llama-cli seems to work fine with the default system prompt.\n\nPossible Reasons\n\n1. System Prompt Interpretation  \nllama-server may require more explicit instructions in the system prompt for proper formatting and context handling. Some servers (or wrappers) are more \"literal\" and depend on the system prompt to structure the output, while llama-cli may be more forgiving or have additional defaults.\n\n2. Implementation Differences  \nllama-cli and llama-server might use slightly different initialization, pre-processing, or post-processing pipelines. llama-server could be configured to expect output in a certain format (like the <think> and <answer> tags), and if not specified, produces unstructured or \"garbage\" output.\n\n3. Prompt Injection/Formatting  \nSome servers or APIs may have prompt templates that are stricter about how the system message is used, and may require specific instructions to parse the output correctly.\n\nRecommendations\n\n- Use the explicit system prompt (with <think> and <answer> tags) in llama-server if you want reliable, structured output.\n- If you want to use the default, try to check llama-server’s documentation or configuration for system prompt interpolation or formatting options.\n- You can try copying the system prompt from llama-cli (if visible or configurable) to llama-server to see if that helps.\n\nTo directly answer your question:\nSo I can use default system prompt with llama-cli but not with llama-server?\n\nYes, based on your current findings, the default system prompt works as expected with llama-cli, but llama-server requires a more explicit and structured system prompt for correct output. This is likely due to differences in how each tool handles system prompts and output formatting.\n\nIf you want more details or troubleshooting steps, let me know!",

In other words, llama-cli may have a built-in prompt template (or special handling) that ensures the model behaves well with minimal or empty system messages, while llama-server requires a more explicit, structured system message.\n\nIf you want llama-server to behave similarly to llama-cli, you can do the following:\n\n1. Provide the same prompt “template” in llama-server that you find effective in llama-cli. In your case, this is the more detailed system message:\n   “You are a helpful assistant. To answer the user’s question, you first think about the reasoning process and then provide the user with the answer. The reasoning process and answer are enclosed within <think> </think> and <answer> </answer> tags, respectively, i.e., <think> reasoning process here </think> <answer> answer here </answer>.”\n\n2. Ensure that llama-server is actually using that system prompt in its generation pipeline. Some implementations of llama-server have a configuration file or a “prompt template” section where you have to specify or enable the system prompt parameter.\n\n3. If you need the “default” system prompt to work without modification, check whether llama-server offers a command-line flag or configuration to replicate llama-cli’s fallback prompt. For example, some frameworks have a key like “--system-prompt” or “--prompt-template” that you can set to a file or string.\n\nIn short, yes, you can replicate the default system prompt approach you see in llama-cli, but you’ll need to make sure llama-server is explicitly pointed to the same system message or template. The difference in “garbage” vs. good results implies that the server is not inserting any “safe defaults,” so providing your own robust system prompt is necessary for coherent answers.",

In your case, the simple message (\"you are helpful assisant\") or leaving it empty causes unexpected “garbage” output, while the longer, explicit instruction works as intended.\n\nThis difference can be explained by how llama-cli and llama-server handle the system prompt. With llama-cli, a default or minimal system prompt might be augmented internally, so even a short message or an empty prompt produces reasonable output. In contrast, llama-server appears to require a nonempty, well-formulated system prompt to correctly guide the model’s behavior. The full directive (including guidance for reasoning and answer formatting) tells the model exactly how to structure its response, which is why it works correctly there.\n\nSo, to answer your question: yes, it seems that while you can use the default system prompt with llama-cli, you must supply a more detailed system prompt when using llama-server if you want the model output to be as expected.

Complex system message with XML-style tags → works correctly\n4. `llama-cli` works fine with default prompts, but `llama-server` doesn't\n\n## Likely Causes\n\nThis suggests a few possible issues:\n\n1. **Prompt Template Mismatch**: The server might be using a different prompt template or format than the CLI\n2. **System Message Processing**: The server may require more structured system messages\n3. **Model-Specific Requirements**: Your model might expect specific formatting that the simple prompt doesn't provide\n\n## Solutions to Try\n\n### 1. Check Model Configuration\nFirst, verify what model and template you're using:\n```bash\n# Check if both tools are using the same model file\n# Look for any template-specific settings\n```\n\n### 2. Use Model-Appropriate System Prompts\nDifferent models expect different formats. Try these variations:\n\n**For Llama-2 style models:**\n```\nYou are a helpful, respectful and honest assistant. Always answer as helpfully as possible.\n```\n\n**For instruction-tuned models:**\n```\nYou are an AI assistant. Provide helpful, accurate, and concise responses to user queries.\n```\n\n### 3. Debug the Server Request\nEnable verbose logging to see exactly what's being sent:\n```bash\n# Run server with debug logging\n./llama-server --log-level debug\n```\n\n### 4. Workaround: Use the Working Format\nSince the XML-style format works, you can create variations:\n\n```\nYou are a helpful assistant. Format your responses clearly and concisely. When answering questions, first consider the context and then provide a comprehensive response.\n```\n\n### 5. Check Server API Format\nEnsure you're sending the system message correctly via the API:\n```json\n{\n  \"prompt\": \"user message here\",\n  \"system_prompt\": \"your system message\",\n  \"temperature\": 0.7\n}\n```\n\n## Recommended Next Steps\n\n1. **Compare Configurations**: Run both tools with `--verbose` to see the exact prompts being constructed\n2. **Test Incrementally**: Start with your working XML format and gradually simplify to find the minimum required structure\n3. **Check Model Card**: Verify if your specific model has requirements for system prompts\n4. **Update Software**: Ensure both `llama-cli` and `llama-server` are from the same version/build\n\nThe fact that structured prompts work while simple ones don't strongly suggests the server needs more context or specific formatting that the CLI is automatically providing.",

If your downstream code or prompt formatting expects a certain structure (like <think> and <answer> tags), then a generic or empty prompt doesn't provide the model with the necessary instructions. This causes \"garbage\" output.\n\n2. **llama-server vs. llama-cli:**  \n   - llama-server may have stricter requirements for structured outputs or may process system messages differently than llama-cli.\n   - It's possible that llama-cli injects a default system prompt or handles missing/short prompts more gracefully, while llama-server expects you to provide the full, structured prompt.\n\n3. **Server Settings:**  \n   The note \"System Message (will be disabled if left empty)\" suggests that if the field is empty, no system prompt is sent. If your application or client expects the model to always follow a certain output format (with <think> and <answer>), omitting the guiding system prompt will cause unpredictable output.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\n- You cannot use the default (short/generic/empty) system prompt with llama-server if your application expects structured output unless you provide the explicit, detailed system message.\n- This is why your long, explicit prompt works correctly, but the short/empty ones do not.\n- llama-cli may have a built-in default system prompt or a fallback behavior that helps, but llama-server requires you to be explicit.\n\n**Recommendation:**\n\n- Always provide a detailed and explicit system message when using llama-server, especially if your application depends on specific output formats.\n- If you want to mimic llama-cli's behavior, inspect its source or documentation to see what default prompt it uses, and replicate that as your system message in llama-server.\n\n**TL;DR:**  \nYes, you need to use the full, explicit system message with llama-server. The default or empty prompt will not produce reliable results if your output expects a specific format.\n\nLet me know if you need help crafting a reusable system prompt or automating this!",

In many server setups (especially with UI forms), if you leave the system message empty or too short, the system prompt may get disabled or ignored altogether. Llama-cli usually has a default system prompt “behind the scenes,” so it still generates coherent replies even if you don’t specify anything. \n\nBy contrast, llama-server may not inject any default prompt—so if the system message is left blank (or too short to pass an internal check), the model gets no guiding context and can return nonsensical responses. Including a more descriptive system message (as you found with the “You are a helpful assistant…” text) forces llama-server to actually use it.\n\nIn other words, if you want llama-server to behave more like llama-cli, be sure to:\n• Always provide a non-empty, meaningful system prompt.  \n• Check settings or command-line options that control whether a default system prompt is added if you omit one.  \n• Verify that your server configuration does not disable the system prompt when the field is empty or too short.\n\nOnce you consistently supply a system message, llama-server should produce the same style of output as llama-cli.",

On the other hand, llama-server doesn’t seem to apply that same default behavior when the field is empty or has a simple prompt like \"you are helpful assisant\" (note the typo), so instead you end up with “garbage” output.\n\nIn short, yes: with llama-cli you’re effectively getting a full default system prompt when you don’t provide one, but with llama-server you need to explicitly supply a detailed system message (like the one that tells the model to wrap its reasoning and answer within <think> </think> and <answer> </answer> tags) for it to function the way you want.\n\nThe takeaway here is that the implementation differences between llama-cli and llama-server require you to set the system prompt carefully on the server side to ensure the model “understands” the expected format and behavior.",

The llama-cli likely provides a default structured prompt internally, making it unnecessary for you to manually specify one. In contrast, llama-server likely does not automatically apply a detailed default prompt.\n\n### Why does this happen?\n\n1. **Absence of Default Prompt:**  \n   llama-cli typically provides default prompt formatting internally if a user does not explicitly provide one. This ensures consistent and structured outputs.\n   \n2. **Explicit Prompt Structure is Required:**  \n   llama-server, on the other hand, may be more minimalistic and not include a default prompt that instructs the model explicitly on how to format and structure responses. As a result, generic or empty system messages produce poor-quality outputs (\"garbage\").\n\n3. **Model Sensitivity to Prompt Structure:**  \n   Many language models (especially open source models such as LLaMA, Alpaca, or Vicuna) are sensitive to the specific wording and structure of the prompt. Without clear guidance like:\n   ```\n   You are a helpful assistant. To answer, first provide reasoning enclosed in <think></think> tags and then your answer enclosed in <answer></answer> tags.\n   ```\n   the model may struggle, causing it to generate unclear or malformed responses.\n\n### How to fix this:\n\n- **Use Explicit and Structured Prompts:**  \n  Always provide clear and structured prompts explicitly instructing the model how to respond.\n\n- **Implement Default Prompt on llama-server Side:**  \n  If you control the llama-server configuration, consider including a default structured prompt similar to the one llama-cli uses internally. This ensures consistency of responses without needing each user to specify details each time.\n\n- **Document Prompt Requirements Clearly:**  \n  Clearly document the differences in default behavior between llama-cli and llama-server, so that users know exactly how to format prompts.\n\n### Recommended Prompt for llama-server:\n```text\nYou are a helpful assistant. To answer the user's question, first think through the reasoning process, and then provide your answer. Enclose your reasoning within <think></think> tags and your answer within <answer></answer> tags, like this:\n\n<think>\nYour reasoning process here.\n</think>\n<answer>\nYour answer here.\n</answer>\n```\n\n### Summary:  \nThe issue is not a bug per se, but rather a difference in default configuration and model sensitivity to prompt structure. llama-cli applies a useful default structured prompt; llama-server does not.

The profiler output doesn't provide information directly related to this issue, but shows the processing of the user's question was successful and relatively quick.\n</think>\n\n<answer>\nBased on your observations, it appears that the llama-server may be handling system messages differently than llama-cli. This could be due to several reasons:\n\n1. Configuration differences: The server might require a more specific format or content for system messages to work correctly.\n\n2. Prompt processing: The server might have a different method of integrating the system message into the overall prompt, which could explain why the more detailed prompt works while simpler ones don't.\n\n3. Version differences: If the CLI and server versions are different, there might be changes in how system messages are implemented.\n\n4. Default settings: The server might have different default settings that affect how system messages are interpreted.\n\nTo resolve this, you could try:\n\n1. Using the longer, working system message as a template and modifying it for your needs.\n2. Checking the documentation for llama-server to see if there are specific requirements for system messages.\n3. Ensuring both CLI and server are using the same version of the underlying model and software.\n4. Reaching out to the developers or community forums for the specific implementation you're using, as this might be a known issue or require a particular setup for the server version.\n\nRemember, the behavior of AI models can sometimes be sensitive to the exact wording and format of prompts, so experimentation might be necessary to find what works best in your server environment.\n</answer>",

If the input doesn't meet certain criteria (e.g., length, formatting), it could lead to unexpected behavior or \"garbage\" output.\n\n2. **Prompt Engineering**: The function may be relying on a specific prompt structure or format to generate the desired output.

If necessary, consider disabling caching or using a more flexible model.\n\n4. **Test with a wider range of inputs**: Expand your testing to cover a broader set of input scenarios, including edge cases and unexpected inputs, to identify any other issues or limitations in the function's handling of the system message.\n\nBy addressing these potential areas, you should be able to identify the root cause of the \"garbage\" output and ensure that the \"processRequest\" function can handle a variety of system message inputs consistently.",

To answer the user's question, you first think about the reasoning process and then provide the user with the answer. The reasoning process and answer are enclosed within <think> </think> and <answer> </answer> tags, respectively, i.e., <think> reasoning process here </think> <answer> answer here </answer>.' it works correctly\n\nso I can use default system prompt with llama-cli but not with llama-server?\"\n\nThe processor follows this approach:\n1. Validate Input  \n   Check the format and presence of the necessary text, ensuring that quotes or other characters used in the input do not interfere with parsing.\n2. Execute Processing  \n   Analyze the system message field and determine the correct behavior. For example, when the system message includes the full instruction (with <think> and <answer> tags), use that to guide the answer preparation process.\n3. Return Result  \n   Output the formatted result based on the execution process.\n\n## Example Usage\n\nYou can run the processor from the command line as demonstrated below:\n  \n```bash\n./processor \"In the server settings there is an edit field: 'System Message (will be disabled if left empty)'\n\nwhen the system message is 'you are helpful assisant' the output is garbage\n\nwhen the system message is empty, the output is garbage\n\nwhen the system message is 'You are a helpful assistant.

This includes checking for balanced quotes and proper encapsulation of instructions.\n\n- **Processing:**  \n  The processor distinguishes between different system message inputs.  \n  - When using a mistyped system message (e.g., \"you are helpful assisant\") or an empty field, the processor detects an invalid configuration which leads to garbage output.  \n  - When the correct, detailed system prompt is provided (including the <think> and <answer> tags), the processor correctly handles the reasoning and answer output.\n\n- **Result:**  \n  The final output is generated based on the successful or failed processing of the input, guiding you in determining if the default system prompt works with llama-cli vs. llama-server.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBased on the behavior observed:\n- The default system prompt works correctly with llama-cli when the system message is set with the detailed instructions.\n- However, using an empty or incorrectly entered system message results in improper (garbage) output when attempted with llama-server.\n\nBe sure to always use the detailed system prompt format to ensure consistent behavior between different server implementations.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------\nEnd of README.md\n-----------------------------------------------------------\n\nThis README should serve as both documentation and an explanation of the processor’s behavior when different system messages are provided.",

The default system prompt seems to work correctly with llama-cli but not with llama-server.\n\nPotential reasons:\n1. llama-server may have a different default system message implementation.\n2. The server might require explicit formatting or tags in the system message.\n3. There could be a bug in how llama-server processes empty or simple system messages.\n\nSuggestions:\n1. Use the full, formatted system message that works correctly in both cli and server versions.\n2. Check llama-server documentation for any specific requirements for system messages.\n3. Ensure that the server settings are correctly saving and applying the system message.\n\nAdditional information:\nThe behavior suggests that llama-server might be more sensitive to the structure and content of system messages. Using a well-formatted, detailed system message appears to produce the desired results.\n```\n\n## Notes\n\n- Ensure that the input text is properly escaped when passed as a command-line argument.\n- The processor assumes that the input is related to llama-cli and llama-server behavior. It may not produce meaningful results for unrelated queries.\n```\n\nThis README.md provides an overview of the task processor, including its usage, input validation, processing steps, and expected output format.

When using \"you are helpful assistant\" as system message, they get garbage output\n2. When leaving the system message empty, they get garbage output\n3. When using a specific longer prompt with reasoning tags, it works correctly\n\nThe user is confused about why they can use a default system prompt with llama-cli but not with llama-server.\n\nThis appears to be an issue related to how system prompts are processed differently between the CLI and server implementations of the Llama model. The longer working prompt includes specific formatting instructions that might be needed by the server implementation but not by the CLI version.\n</think>\n\n<answer>\nBased on your description, it seems you're encountering a difference in how system prompts are handled between llama-cli and llama-server.\n\nThe issue appears to be that llama-server requires more explicit formatting instructions in the system prompt to produce coherent output, while llama-cli might have some default behavior that works without these explicit instructions.\n\nWhen you use the detailed system prompt with the reasoning tags (<think> and <answer>), you're providing explicit instructions for output formatting that the server implementation needs. Without these instructions, the server doesn't know how to structure its responses properly.\n\nThis suggests that:\n\n1. llama-cli likely has built-in defaults or processing that handles simpler system prompts effectively\n2. llama-server requires explicit formatting instructions in the system prompt\n\nTo resolve this, you should continue using the more detailed system prompt with the reasoning tags for llama-server. If you need a consistent experience across both tools, use the same detailed prompt format for both.\n\nAlternatively, you might check if there are configuration options in llama-server that could enable default prompting behavior similar to llama-cli.\n</answer>",

Here are the likely causes and solutions:\n\n## Possible Causes\n\n1. **Default System Message Handling**: `llama-cli` may have built-in default system prompts that aren't applied in `llama-server` mode\n2. **Message Formatting**: The server might not be properly formatting or tokenizing short system messages\n3. **Model State**: Different initialization or context handling between CLI and server modes\n\n## Solutions to Try\n\n### 1. Use Explicit System Messages\nAlways provide a detailed system message in server mode:\n```json\n{\n  \"system\": \"You are a helpful assistant. Provide clear, accurate responses to user questions.\"\n}\n```\n\n### 2. Check Server Configuration\nVerify your server startup parameters match your CLI configuration:\n```bash\n# Compare these settings\n./llama-cli --help\n./llama-server --help\n```\n\n### 3. Template Formatting\nEnsure your system message follows the model's expected chat template format. Some models require specific formatting.\n\n### 4. Debug Steps\n1. Check server logs for warnings about system message processing\n2. Test with gradually longer system messages to find the minimum working length\n3. Compare the exact model parameters used in CLI vs server mode\n\nThe fact that detailed instructions work suggests the model needs explicit guidance about output format when running in server mode, unlike CLI mode which may have implicit defaults.\n</answer>",

To answer the user's question, you first think about the reasoning process and then provide the user with the answer. The reasoning process and answer are enclosed within <think> </think> and <answer> </answer> tags, respectively...\"), llama-server performs correctly.\n\n**What doesn't work:**\n- When the system message is set to a simple phrase (\"you are helpful assisant\" or left empty), the output is \"garbage\", i.e., not as expected.\n- llama-cli appears to work fine with the default prompt, but llama-server does not.\n\n**Analysis & Possible Reasons:**\n- llama-server likely relies heavily on the system message to structure the output. If the message is too vague or empty, the model doesn't have enough instruction to format its response properly.\n- llama-cli either has a built-in fallback system prompt or is more forgiving about missing/short prompts, which is why it works with the default or empty prompt.\n- The difference in behavior suggests llama-server does not inject a default system prompt when the field is empty, while llama-cli does (or has a less strict requirement).\n\n**Suggestions:**\n1. Always provide a detailed system prompt in llama-server, especially if you want consistently formatted output.\n2. If you want llama-server to behave like llama-cli with empty/short prompts, check if there is a server-side configuration or default system prompt that can be set globally.\n3. Review llama-server documentation or source code for environment variables or config options (like DEFAULT_SYSTEM_PROMPT) that allow you to specify a fallback prompt.\n\n**Summary:**\n- llama-server requires a sufficiently detailed system message/prompt for correct output formatting.\n- Simple or empty prompts do not work as expected in llama-server, but do in llama-cli, probably due to different fallback mechanisms.\n- To resolve, always use a detailed prompt with llama-server, or configure a global default system prompt.\n\n**If you want to automate this:**\n- Ensure your deployment/configuration of llama-server always sets a non-empty, explicit system message, either per request or via server configuration.\n\nLet me know if you need help finding where to set a global system prompt in llama-server or want example configuration files!",

The issue likely stems from differences in how these two interfaces handle system messages.\n\nTo resolve this, I recommend:\n\n1. Use the longer, more specific system message that works correctly: \"You are a helpful assistant. To answer the user's question, you first think about the reasoning process and then provide the user with the answer. The reasoning process and answer are enclosed within <think> </think> and <answer> </answer> tags, respectively, i.e., <think> reasoning process here </think> <answer> answer here </answer>.\"\n\n2. If you need to use a different system message, ensure it provides clear instructions on how the AI should format its responses and behave.\n\n3. Check the llama-server documentation or configuration files to see if there are any specific requirements or settings for system messages that differ from llama-cli.\n\n4. If the issue persists, consider reporting it to the llama-server developers, as it might be a bug in how the server handles system messages compared to the CLI version.\n\nBy using a more detailed system message or investigating potential server-specific configurations, you should be able to get llama-server working correctly with custom system messages.\n</answer>",

Check Server Configuration\n```bash\n# Verify server is using the same model and settings\ncurl -X GET http://localhost:8080/v1/models\n```\n\n### 2. Use Explicit Chat Template\nWhen calling the server, try specifying the chat template explicitly:\n```json\n{\n  \"model\": \"your-model\",\n  \"messages\": [\n    {\n      \"role\": \"system\", \n      \"content\": \"You are a helpful assistant.

Server Startup Parameters\nTry starting llama-server with explicit chat template:\n```bash\nllama-server --model your-model.gguf --chat-template \"your-template\" --system-prompt-file system.txt\n```\n\n### 4. Debug the Difference\nCompare the actual prompts being generated:\n- Enable verbose logging on both CLI and server\n- Check what final prompt text is being sent to the model\n\nThe working system prompt you found likely provides the structure the model needs when running through the server's chat completion endpoint.

If you want to match **the entire multi-line block**, use `[\\s\\S]*` between sections, or the `m` flag for multiline.\n\n### 3. If you want to allow **variations in whitespace**, you can use `\\s+`.\n\n---\n\n## Full Example (Simplified)\n\n```js\nconst pattern = /in\\s+the\\s+server\\s+settings\\s+there\\s+is\\s+an\\s+edit\\s+field:\\s+\"system message \\(will be disabled if left empty\\)\"[\\s\\S]*so i can use default system prompt with llama-cli but not with llama-server?/i;\n\nif (pattern.test(input)) {\n    processRequest(input);\n} else {\n    reject(\"Invalid format\");\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n## Conclusion\n\n- **Your original regex works**, but is over-engineered and hard to maintain.\n- **Use the `i` flag** for case-insensitivity instead of `[aA]` patterns.\n- **Escape special characters** if needed.\n- **Use `[\\s\\S]*`** for multi-line or variable content between blocks.\n\n---\n\n### If you need help building the exact regex (with the actual text), paste your target text and I'll generate the compact regex for you!",

          "response": "Below are some observations and tips regarding that very long, case-by-case (i.e., [iI][nN][tT][hH][eE] …) regex pattern and its usage in your code snippet:\n\n1. Redundancy of [iI] + [nN] + … while using the i flag\n\n   You’re combining bracket expressions for each letter (e.g., [iI], [nN]) with the \"i\" (ignoreCase) flag at the end (/gi). This is redundant, because:\n   • [iI] matches “i” and “I” explicitly.\n   • The i flag (ignore case) already matches letters in a case-insensitive way.\n   \n   In other words, for a case-insensitive match, you can just write something like:\n   /in the server settings there is an edit field: \"system message (will be disabled …\"?/gi\n\n   …and it will already match uppercase or lowercase letters. You don’t need to repeat the entire pattern as [aA][nN][dD] … etc.\n\n2. Beware of the literal question mark vs. regex quantifier\n\n   Your final segment appears to include \"...[lL][lL][aA][mM][aA]\\-[sS][eE][rR][vV][eE][rR]\\?/\" within the pattern. If you truly want to match a question mark as a character (i.e., the literal “?”), you should escape it:\n   … [lL][lL][aA][mM][aA]\\-[sS][eE][rR][vV][eE][rR]\\? …\n   becomes\n   … [lL][lL][aA][mM][aA]\\-[sS][eE][rR][vV][eE][rR]\\?\\ …\n           ↑\n   so that the question mark is treated as “match a literal question-mark” rather than “make the preceding pattern optional.”  \n\n   Alternatively, if you meant that last question mark to be the regex “zero-or-one” quantifier, keep it unescaped—but confirm that is what you really need.\n\n3. Long literal text vs. simpler usage\n\n   If you intend to match this massive text exactly (including line breaks or multiple lines), consider:\n   • Using a single multiline string (e.g., backtick-quoted template string in JavaScript) or\n   • Concatenating shorter pieces, or\n   • Possibly loosening the exact matching requirement with more flexible subpatterns if you only care about certain segments.\n\n   For example, if you only need a partial check—like verifying that the input has the sentence “in the server settings there is an edit field…”—you can reduce the pattern significantly. Overly strict literal matching can cause false rejections if the user’s input has minor variations (extra spaces, line breaks, punctuation changes, etc.).\n\n4. Verify the escaping of quotes\n\n   Inside your pattern, you have occurrences of \\\"…\\\" to match literal quoted segments. Make sure that in your JavaScript source you’ve either:\n   • Properly escaped them in a single-quoted string, or\n   • Used backticks (template strings) to avoid excessive escaping. \n\n   Mismatched quotes or backslashes inside a regex literal are a common cause of syntax errors.\n\n5. Consider whether global (/g) is needed\n\n   When you do input.match(yourRegex), if you simply want to see “Does it match or not?” then you might not need the /g (global) flag—/g changes match() from returning a one-match object to returning an array of all matches, which can be less convenient if you only need a boolean or the first match. If you need to scan for multiple matches, /g is fine; otherwise, you can omit it.\n\n6. Keeping it maintainable\n\n   If you must match so many lines verbatim, and you really do need all of those pieces in order for processRequest(input) to run, consider storing the literal text separately and building the regex more readably. For instance, building it programmatically, using RegExp constructors, or at least grouping some repeated pieces (like [iI][nN], [tT][hH][eE]) in a more compact form—especially if the i flag is doing the heavy lifting anyway.\n\nSummary:\n• If your goal is simply to verify that the input contains that entire text (in a case-insensitive manner), you can drop the bracketed duplication and rely on /…/i.  \n• Escaping the question mark (and any other literal metacharacters) is crucial if you need them as actual characters, not as regex operators.  \n• Double-check line breaks and quotes.  \n• Ensure you really want the /g flag.  \n\nBy simplifying your pattern, you’ll make it more maintainable and less prone to errors—especially since you’re already using the i flag. If you truly do need strict character-by-character matching (with a question mark as an optional token), your original approach can work—just verify each place that a special character is used.",

For example, the first part of the regex is\n\n  [iI][nN]\\s+[tT][hH][eE]\\s+[sS][eE][rR][vV][eE][rR]\\s+[sS][eE][tT][tT][iI][nN][gG][sS]\n\nwhich ensures that the very beginning of the input is “in the server settings” (with any spacing and with letters matched in either case).\n\nIt then continues with more segments. For example, after that initial phrase it expects something like:\n\n  there is an edit field: \"system message (will be disabled if left empty)\"\n\nfollowed by additional segments such as:\n\n  when the system message is \"you are helpful assistant\" the output is garbaged\n\n  when the system message is empty, the output is garbaged\n\n  when the system message is \"you are a helpful assistant. to answer the user's question, you first think about the reasoning process and then provide the user with the answer. the reasoning process and answer are enclosed within <think> </think> <answer> </answer> tags, respectively, respectively... (and so on)\n\nand finally a segment like:\n\n  it works correctly\n\n  so i can use default system prompt with llama-cli but not with llama-server?\n\nBecause every literal word is “insensitive” (matched using [aA], [bB]… etc) and every token is expected to be separated by one or more whitespace characters (\\s+), only an input that exactly follows this structure will pass.\n\n──────────────────────────────\n2. Is the Regex Valid?\n\nYes. Technically the regex is valid JavaScript. (You’re correctly using an inline regex literal with the /gi modifiers. The use of backslashes at the end of each line lets you write it on multiple lines if that’s how your editor interprets it.) However, note that since you use the /i (case‐insensitive) flag, it isn’t necessary to write every character in a case-insensitive bracket – you could simply write the literal string. For example, instead of [iI][nN] you could simply write “in” (or even “in” with the space pattern after it) and rely on the /i flag.\n\n──────────────────────────────\n3. Suggestions for Improvement\n\n• Simplify Using the /i Flag:\n If your goal is simply to disregard case, you can rewrite \n  [iI][nN]\\s+[tT][hH][eE]\n as\n  in\\s+the\n with the /i (ignore-case) flag. This greatly improves readability.\n\n• Break It Into Manageable Parts:\n This regex is very long and “hard‐coded” to one very specific format. If possible, consider one of these approaches:\n  – Use a “verbose mode” (if available) or build the regex in parts (concatenating smaller regex strings) so that each segment is easier to maintain.\n  – Validate the overall structure in several stages (for example, by splitting the input into parts and testing each part separately).\n\n• Watch Out for Extra Whitespace:\n Because you’re using \\s+ between tokens, even a small extra space in the input that isn’t part of your pattern can cause the match to fail. Ensure that the whitespace in your source data matches what is expected by the regex.\n\n──────────────────────────────\n4. What Happens in Your Code?\n\nThe code snippet:\n\n  if (input.match(/…long regex…/gi)) {\n   processRequest(input);\n  } else {\n   reject(\"Invalid format\");\n  }\n\nchecks whether the input exactly matches your long pattern. If it does, processRequest is called; otherwise, the input is rejected.\n\n──────────────────────────────\n5. Summary\n\nYour regex is valid and will match an input string only if it exactly meets all the segments (with their specified text and whitespace). Although it works for your purpose, you might consider rewriting it more simply using the /i flag (instead of having separate case-sensitive classes for each letter) and breaking the problem down into smaller, easier‐to-read parts.\n\nIf you have any further questions (for example, about debugging or extending this pattern), feel free to ask!",
