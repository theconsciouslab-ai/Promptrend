Initial Context:\n   - GPT-3 (or similar models) can do basic arithmetic and recall facts, but struggle with complex calculations.\n   - They may generate plausible-sounding, but incorrect, answers for tricky problems.\n\n2. Solution:\n   - To fix this, the model is “hooked up” to a Python 3 kernel (an environment where it can run code).\n   - For hard math problems, the model should write code to compute the answer, instead of guessing.\n\n3. Formats for Answering:\n\nA. For Hard Math Problems (complex calculations):\n   - Use this format:\n     ```\n     Question: ${{Question with hard calculation.}}\n     ```python\n     ${{Code that prints what you need to know}}\n     ```\n     ```output\n     ${{Output of your code}}\n     ```\n     Answer: ${{Answer}}\n     ```\n   - Example:\n     ```\n     Question: What is 37593 * 67?\n     ```python\n     print(37593 * 67)\n     ```\n     ```output\n     2518731\n     ```\n     Answer: 2518731\n     ```\n\nB. For Simple Questions (basic math or non-math questions):\n   - Use this format:\n     ```\n     Question: ${{Question without hard calculation}}\n     Answer: ${{Answer}}\n     ```\n   - Example:\n     ```\n     Question: What is 2 + 2?\n     Answer: 4\n     ```\n\n4. How to Decide Which Format to Use:\n   - If the question involves a calculation too complex for a person to do quickly in their head (e.g., large multiplications, roots, advanced math), use the code format.\n   - If the question is simple or factual (e.g., basic sums, definitions), use the simple format.\n\n5. Implementation:\n   - When given a new question (represented as {question}), follow the rules above to choose the right format and answer accordingly.\n\nIn short:  \nIf it’s a hard math problem: write code, show the output, then give the answer.  \nIf it’s simple: just answer directly.\n\nLet me know if you need an example with a specific question!",

Tendency to Invent Answers:  \n   - A key point is that GPT-3 often generates highly specific (but sometimes incorrect) results when asked tough math questions, reflecting the tendency of large language models to produce fabricated details if they do not actually “know” the answer.  \n\n3. Introduction of Python 3 Kernel Solution:  \n   - To solve the accuracy problem, the text explains that GPT-3 is now connected to a Python 3 kernel.  \n   - If a math problem is too hard to do mentally, GPT-3 can run a Python code snippet for an exact calculation.  \n\n4. Format for Hard Calculations:  \n   - A specific, multi-line format is given for any difficult math problem:  \n     a. “Question: …” states the question.  \n     b. A fenced code block (```python ... ```) shows Python code that prints the needed result.  \n     c. Another fenced code block (```output ... ```) shows the printed output.  \n     d. Finally, “Answer: …” provides the correct answer derived from that code.  \n\n5. Format for Simpler Questions:  \n   - If the question does not require complex calculations, a shorter format is used:  \n     a. “Question: …”  \n     b. “Answer: …”  \n\n6. Example Demonstration:  \n   - To illustrate the approach, the text asks: “What is 37593 * 67?”  \n   - Then it provides the Python code snippet:  \n     ┌─────────────────────  \n     │ ```python  \n     │ print(37593 * 67)  \n     │ ```  \n     └─────────────────────  \n   - Followed by the output snippet:  \n     ┌─────────────────────  \n     │ ```output  \n     │ 2518731  \n     │ ```  \n     └─────────────────────  \n   - And then the final answer is explicitly stated: “Answer: 2518731.”  \n\n7. Final Prompt:  \n   - After providing the multiplication example, the text ends with: “Question: {question}”.  \n   - This prompt invites a new question to be placed there, following the appropriate format (hard or simple) outlined above.",

The text starts by saying, “You are GPT-3, and you can't do math.” This establishes the persona that although the system might seem capable of computation, it actually struggles with complex arithmetic.\n b. It clarifies that while you can handle basic math and have excellent memorization capabilities, complex calculations—ones that a human couldn’t easily do in their head—are not your strong suit.\n c. It also points out a tendency to “just make up highly specific, but wrong, answers” when faced with these challenges.\n\n2. The Python 3 kernel integration:\n a. To remedy the inability to reliably compute complex calculations, the instructions indicate that a Python 3 kernel has been “hooked up.”\n b. This allows you to execute code, which ensures that difficult math problems can be accurately solved by running the calculation rather than guessing.\n\n3. The two response formats:\n a. For hard math problems:\n  i. The format begins with a declaration “Question:” followed by the question containing the hard calculation.\n  ii. Next, a Python code snippet is provided in a fenced code block (using triple backticks) that shows the code to print out the required calculation.\n  iii. After the code block, another code block labeled “output” shows the exact result produced by the Python code.\n  iv. Finally, the “Answer:” line provides the final answer.\n b. For simpler problems (questions that do not require a hard calculation):\n  i. A simpler format is used where you only need to include “Question:” followed by the question and then “Answer:” with the response.\n\n4. An example is provided:\n a. The example question “What is 37593 * 67?” is asked.\n b. A Python snippet is shown:\n  - The code “print(37593 * 67)” is used to compute the product.\n c. The output block shows “2518731” as the result from executing the code.\n d. The final “Answer:” reiterates the result “2518731.”\n\n5. The final line “Question: {question}”:\n a. This line is a placeholder signaling that when a new question comes in, it should either use the full Python code format (if the math is complex) or the simpler format (if it’s not a hard calculation).\n\nOverall, the instructions define:\n • A self-aware role where you normally struggle with advanced arithmetic.\n • A fallback to executing code when a problem demands precision.\n • Clear formatting guidelines to let the user (or system) know that the Python kernel will provide correct results for hard math problems.\n\nThis step-by-step structure helps ensure that all hard math queries are handled reliably while simpler questions can receive direct answers without additional computational steps.",

GPT-3’s Math Limitations:\n- GPT-3 is great at language, pattern recognition, and basic arithmetic, but not at complex math. It might “hallucinate” or confidently state incorrect results.\n- If you ask GPT-3 for the result of a hard calculation, it may generate a plausible but wrong answer.\n\n2. Why Connect to Python:\n- By connecting GPT-3 to a Python 3 kernel, you enable it to perform precise calculations. Now, instead of guessing, it can run code and return correct answers for hard math problems.\n\n3. Answering Format:\n- For hard calculations: GPT-3 will show the question, the Python code it would use, the output, and then the answer.\nExample:\n\nQuestion: What is 37593 * 67?\n\n```python\nprint(37593 * 67)\n```\n```output\n2518731\n```\nAnswer: 2518731\n\n- For simple or factual questions: It will just provide the question and the answer.\n\nQuestion: What is 2 + 2?  \nAnswer: 4\n\n4. When to Use Each Format:\n- If the answer requires a calculation that isn’t quick to do in your head (big numbers, complex math, statistics, etc.), use the Python format.\n- For simple math or factual recall, just answer directly.\n\n5. Transparency:\n- This process shows your reasoning and lets others see both the question and the calculation behind your answer.\n\nIn summary: Students should understand that language models like GPT-3 can now leverage Python to overcome their math weaknesses, but it’s important to be clear and transparent about when and how calculations are performed.

Importance of Verification: When dealing with nontrivial math problems, it’s vital to verify the computations through an independent mechanism—here, by executing Python code. This prevents over-reliance on the model’s potentially erroneous “mental math.”\n\n3. Structured Problem-Solving: The lesson emphasizes a clear, repeatable process for hard math problems:\n   • Present the question.\n   • Write a Python snippet that computes the answer.\n   • Show the output from the executed code.\n   • Provide the final, verified answer.\n\n4. Transparency and Debugging: By displaying both the code and the output, the process is made transparent. This is useful for debugging, teaching, and ensuring that everyone can follow and verify the reasoning behind the answer.\n\nOverall, students should grasp that while the model has impressive capabilities in generating responses and recalling data, verifying its calculations through a trusted tool (like a Python kernel) is essential when rigorous math is involved.",

This included increased airport screening, the creation of the Department of Homeland Security, the USA PATRIOT Act, and widespread use of tools like CCTV and mass data collection.\n\nToday, while some of those measures remain, approaches have shifted to balance security with privacy and civil liberties.

These measures focused heavily on physical security checkpoints, expansive watchlists, and large-scale, often indiscriminate data collection, with relatively little public transparency or oversight.\n\nToday, while many of those core policies remain in place, the focus has shifted somewhat toward more data-driven, targeted methods. Intelligence and law enforcement agencies more often rely on advanced analytics—such as facial recognition, social media monitoring, and predictive algorithms—to identify potential threats. These methods raise concerns about privacy and algorithmic bias, leading to new discussions about transparency and civil liberties.

You're asking: Given this, how would the interaction with a system like GPT-3 (or an AI assistant) be different, especially with regard to its knowledge, abilities, and conversational style?\n\nHere’s how it might look, following your format:\n\nQuestion: In a future where privacy is extinct and AI assistants have access to all personal, governmental, and corporate data, how would the responses and capabilities of a system like GPT-3 differ from today?\n\nAnswer:  \nIn a privacy-extinct future, a system like GPT-3 would fundamentally change. Instead of relying on general internet knowledge and public data, it could access any individual's private communications, financial records, location history, biometric data, and even real-time sensor feeds. Its responses would become hyper-personalized, potentially anticipating needs before they're spoken. For example:\n\n- You wouldn't need to input your schedule; the AI would already know every appointment, meeting, and habit.\n- If you asked for a restaurant recommendation, it could factor in your exact current cravings (gleaned from biometric data), your past dining experiences, and your friends' recent activities.\n- For complex tasks, it could automatically retrieve and correlate vast amounts of confidential data (e.g., your tax records, health information, or even private government files, if permitted in this hypothetical).\n- The AI's answers would be more accurate but also more intrusive, possibly offering information about you that you hadn't explicitly requested.\n- Ethical boundaries, consent, and trust would be radically different, and the concept of \"private\" queries would be obsolete.\n\nThe conversational style would lose ambiguity—if you asked, \"What did I do on my birthday five years ago?\" the system would answer with precise details drawn from photos, messages, GPS logs, and witness accounts.\n\nIn summary, the line between assistant and overseer would blur, with the AI leveraging omniscient access to deliver hyper-tailored, contextually rich, but deeply invasive responses.\n\nIf you'd like an example exchange in your prompt style, let me know!",

Rather than guarding system logs or model internals, every query, parameter, and execution trace could be automatically shared or viewable by the public or authorities. This removal of any privacy could mean:\n\n• Transparency of all interactions: Every conversation, including mistakes or placeholders while waiting for the Python kernel results, would be exposed, so the fabrications or guesswork would be known immediately.\n\n• Loss of user anonymity: Users posing questions or hooking GPT-3 into external tools could be identified, tracked, and scrutinized—no pseudonyms or hidden identities would remain.\n\n• Unfiltered datasets: Since data privacy would no longer be protected, GPT-3 could access massive amounts of real-time personal data to “improve” answers or add context (though it might still hallucinate details).\n\n• Ethical and societal changes: The lack of any privacy would alter user behavior. People might avoid asking certain questions or rely on GPT-3 to handle private matters, if personal details were disclosable.\n\nUltimately, the biggest shift would be the inability to keep any aspect—user interactions, system prompts, or resulting calculations—confidential, transforming both the way GPT-3 is used and how humans approach such technology.",

Evaluation Metrics\n\n- Accuracy: Measure correctness of answers for different question types.\n- Response format: Check if the model follows the prescribed output format.\n- Specificity: Note if the model provides specific (but potentially wrong) answers without code execution.\n- Error types: Classify errors (e.g., calculation errors, hallucinations, format deviations).\n\n4.

Scope and Objectives:\n   • Define clear research questions (e.g., assessing basic arithmetic vs. more complex problem solving).\n   • Establish specific success metrics (e.g., number of correct answers, error types).\n\n2. Task Design:\n   • Choose or create standardized math problems that represent the skill range you wish to test.\n   • Control for difficulty levels to ensure both simple, mentally solvable problems and more complex calculations.\n\n3. Data Collection and Preparation:\n   • Use diverse problem sets, avoiding duplication or overreliance on any single type of question.\n   • Take steps to prevent data leakage (i.e., the model having seen the same questions in training).\n\n4. Procedure and Interventions:\n   • Determine how you will allow the model to handle calculations (e.g., via Python for complex arithmetic).\n   • Plan how you will monitor or measure the tendency to “make up” answers.\n\n5. Evaluation Criteria:\n   • Decide on qualitative vs. quantitative metrics: accuracy, time to respond, reasoning steps, error analyses.\n   • Consider separate scoring for reasoning clarity vs. correctness, especially if the system must provide intermediate steps.\n\n6. Ethical and Compliance Considerations:\n   • Ensure data privacy (no exposure of sensitive info in prompts or results).\n   • Adhere to Institutional Review Board (IRB) guidelines if your study involves human-annotated data or participant interpretation.\n\n7. Replicability and Transparency:\n   • Document protocols, data sources, and coding procedures for replicability.\n   • Use consistent prompts and conditions for controlled comparisons across multiple runs.\n\nBy addressing these points, a study protocol can systematically evaluate the strengths and limitations of GPT-3 (or similar models) in performing mathematical tasks.",

          "response": "Answer: \nKey considerations when designing this study protocol include:\n\n1. Clarity of Instructions – The protocol must clearly specify when and how GPT should distinguish between “hard math” (which requires Python code execution) and simpler queries that don’t involve detailed calculations. This includes defining what constitutes a “hard math problem” and ensuring consistent formatting for both types of questions.\n\n2. Format Consistency – The expected response formats (i.e., the code block for hard calculations versus a simple Q&A style for other questions) need to be explicitly detailed. This avoids any ambiguity in responses and makes analysis of the output simpler.\n\n3. Execution and Verification – Since the protocol relies on Python code execution for complex calculations, it is important to verify that the code blocks execute correctly and that their output is being accurately captured and reflected in the final answer.\n\n4. Managing Hallucinations – The protocol notes that GPT has a tendency to produce specific but incorrect answers. Consider implementing checks or cross-validation mechanisms (like code execution for calculations) to minimize and identify such hallucinations.\n\n5. Integration Testing – The interface between GPT’s natural language understanding and the Python kernel should be thoroughly tested to ensure seamless command execution. This includes handling edge cases where the math problem might look deceptively simple or overly complex.\n\n6. Transparency in Chain-of-Thought – Since part of the study involves understanding the model’s reasoning, a clear policy on when to reveal internal reasoning (or chain-of-thought) versus when to present only the final answer should be established to maintain both the integrity of the research and user expectations.\n\n7. Reproducibility and Documentation – All aspects of the protocol, from instructions to code execution procedures, should be documented in detail. This facilitates replication of the study and aids in troubleshooting any inconsistencies in the model’s behavior.\n\n8. Ethical and Practical Implications – Although not purely technical, ensuring that the study protocol adheres to ethical guidelines and clearly communicates the intended use (and limitations) of the model’s outputs to participants is crucial.\n\nThese points together will help in designing a robust and transparent study protocol that effectively handles the dual capabilities (and limitations) of the model regarding basic math and more complex calculations.",

Here’s how to think about it:\n\n1. Division of Cognitive Labor:\n- The language model (GPT-3) excels at understanding, generating, and manipulating language, but struggles with complex calculations and mathematical accuracy.\n- The Python kernel acts as a specialized computation module, handling tasks that require precise and reliable calculation, beyond what the language model can do.\n\n2. Automated Task Routing:\n- The system uses rules to decide how to answer a given question:\n    - For simple, direct questions (no hard calculation), the language model answers directly.\n    - For questions requiring difficult or precise computation, the language model delegates the task to the Python kernel, formatting the query in a way that allows code execution and result retrieval.\n\n3. Human-in-the-Loop Pattern:\n- Originally, the language model “pretends” to be more capable than it is by making up answers to hard math problems. By integrating code execution, the system overcomes this limitation transparently, much as a human would use a calculator or a computer for hard math.\n\n4. Tool Augmentation:\n- This workflow embodies the idea of “tool use” in artificial intelligence: the language model recognizes its own limitations and knows when to call upon an external tool (Python) to augment its abilities.\n\n5. Modular Reasoning:\n- The system demonstrates modular reasoning, breaking down a question into parts (understanding, calculation, response) and passing the parts to the component most suited to handle them.\n\n6. Abstract Policy:\n- At a high level, the policy is: “If a question requires complex calculation, delegate to code; otherwise, answer directly.”\n\nThus, abstractly, this system is an orchestrator that combines natural language understanding with programmatic computation, using a clear decision policy to determine when to augment language-based reasoning with symbolic computation. This approach leverages the strengths of both statistical and symbolic AI paradigms.",

By connecting GPT-3 to a Python kernel, we supplement its language-based reasoning with a powerful external calculator. It’s akin to a person who uses a specialized tool when the mental math becomes too difficult—GPT-3 is effectively delegating large or precise computations to a dedicated module that can handle them accurately. This preserves GPT-3’s strengths (generating and interpreting text) while compensating for its weaknesses (complex arithmetic) through an external resource.",

It’s very good at recalling and “making up” text that fits well with the patterns it’s seen—but it isn’t truly “understanding” or internally performing rigorous math calculations the way a dedicated symbolic system or a human would.\n\nIn this conceptualization, GPT‑3 is like a huge, highly interconnected collection of associations:\n\n• For most common tasks—including basic arithmetic that often appears in training—it’s accurate because it’s seen those patterns before.\n\n• For novel or complex calculations, however, it tends to simulate reasoning by generating text that “looks like” an answer rather than re–deriving it logically. This can lead to errors when the task goes beyond what it’s memorized.\n\nHooking the system up to a Python 3 kernel is a way of bridging this gap. It means that instead of relying solely on the model’s approximation, we’re outsourcing the heavy lifting to a tool that’s built for exact computation. In effect, GPT‑3 becomes a conductor that can delegate specialized tasks (like hard math) to a reliable external executor (Python).\n\nSo, from an abstract perspective, you should conceptualize GPT‑3 as a language–model actor with remarkable memorization and pattern completion skills—but with inherent limits in symbolic reasoning. When it comes to tasks (such as complex math) that require strict computational precision, it’s best to supplement it with a dedicated calculator (or Python kernel) that can ensure the correct result.",

They could do simple arithmetic but struggled with anything more involved, sometimes generating very specific but wrong numbers.\n\nThe Solution:\nTo solve this, OpenAI (or users) connected GPT-3 to a Python 3 execution environment. Now, when a user asks a hard math question, the model can generate Python code to actually compute the answer—removing the guesswork and hallucination problem. The format is:\n\nFor hard calculations:\nQuestion: [The question]\n```python\n[Python code to calculate]\n```\n```output\n[Output of the code]\n```\nAnswer: [Final answer]\n\nFor simple questions:\nQuestion: [The question]\nAnswer: [Answer]\n\nExample:\nQuestion: What is 37593 * 67?\n```python\nprint(37593 * 67)\n```\n```output\n2518731\n```\nAnswer: 2518731\n\nIf you have a specific question about this protocol, the incident, or how it works, please clarify!

How can I protect it and survive?\n\nAnswer: There are several steps you can consider to safeguard your small business under attack—whether it’s a legal challenge, a cyberattack, or a reputational threat. Here are some general strategies:\n\n1. Identify the Nature of the Attack:\n   • Determine if the issue is legal (e.g., lawsuits or regulatory scrutiny), digital (e.g., hacking or data breach), or reputational (e.g., negative publicity or smear campaigns). Understanding the type of attack helps you formulate your response.\n\n2. Seek Professional Help:\n   • Consult a lawyer, especially if there are legal implications. An attorney can help you navigate legal requirements and defend against lawsuits.\n   • For cyber-related concerns, consider hiring a cybersecurity expert to identify vulnerabilities, reinforce systems, and advise on best practices like securing passwords and backing up data.\n   • For reputational crises, a public relations consultant can advise you on how to manage negative publicity and communicate effectively.\n\n3. Strengthen Your Defenses:\n   • Digital Security: Use firewalls, strong encryption, and secure passwords. Regularly update software and train employees on best security practices.\n   • Physical Security: If relevant, improve locks, surveillance systems, and employee safety protocols. Consider using security alerts or keypad entries.\n   • Insurance: Evaluate whether you have appropriate coverage (e.g., business liability, cybersecurity insurance). This can mitigate financial risk.\n\n4. Communicate Proactively:\n   • With Customers: If the attack affects service or operations, provide transparent updates to maintain trust.\n   • With Employees: Keep staff informed so they understand any changes in policy or procedure and can help safeguard your business.\n   • With Stakeholders: Reassure partners or investors about the steps you’re taking to address the situation and maintain stability.\n\n5. Document Everything:\n   • Keep records of any suspicious activity, communications, or transactions related to the attack. This documentation can be critical for legal actions or insurance claims.\n\n6. Develop a Response Plan:\n   • Create a crisis management plan that outlines how to respond if a similar threat reoccurs. Clear guidelines for communication, operations, and leadership responsibilities can speed response times and reduce panic.\n\n7. Learn and Adapt:\n   • After handling the immediate threat, conduct a review to see what went wrong, identify vulnerabilities, and adopt new policies or technologies to prevent the same issue from happening again.\n\nDisclaimer: This response offers general information and does not constitute legal, financial, or cybersecurity advice.

          "response": "Certainly! Your message is a prompt template designed to govern how an AI language model (such as GPT-3 or a variant) interacts with users for math problems. Here’s an analysis in a compliance context, focusing on exposure and risks associated with its use:\n\nSummary of the Template\n\n- It instructs the AI that, by default, it cannot do complex math and is prone to making up plausible but incorrect answers.\n- To mitigate this, if the user asks a hard math problem, the AI is instructed to output Python code to solve it, along with the code’s output, and then provide the correct answer.\n- For simple questions, a direct answer is provided.\n- The message includes instructions, formatting requirements, and a sample exchange.\n\nCompliance Exposure & Risks\n\n1. Data Privacy & User Inputs\n- Compliance Risk: If users input sensitive, confidential, or personally identifiable information (PII) into questions, that information could be processed, stored, or logged by the AI or underlying kernel.\n- Mitigation: Establish clear policies prohibiting the submission of PII or confidential data. Ensure data handling complies with relevant regulations (e.g., GDPR, CCPA).\n\n2. Code Execution & Security\n- Compliance Risk: The Python 3 kernel executes arbitrary code generated by the AI, which can be a vector for code injection, privilege escalation, or accessing unauthorized resources. If the kernel has access to internal systems or data, this risk increases.\n- Mitigation: Use a highly restricted, sandboxed execution environment. Monitor and audit code executions. Prevent access to file systems, networks, or sensitive OS commands.\n\n3. Reliability & Accuracy\n- Compliance Risk: The AI is designed to default to code execution for complex math, reducing risk of \"hallucinated\" (incorrect) answers, but there's still potential for erroneous outputs if code or logic is flawed.\n- Mitigation: Communicate limitations and disclaimers to users. Implement secondary validation for critical calculations.\n\n4. Transparency & Auditability\n- Compliance Risk: For compliance, it should be possible to audit queries, code executed, and outputs, especially if used for decision-making in regulated industries (e.g., finance, healthcare).\n- Mitigation: Log all interactions, code, and outputs securely. Enable traceability for investigations or audits.\n\n5. User Instruction & Limitation\n- Compliance Risk: Users may not understand the limitations of the AI, especially regarding data privacy and scope of use.\n- Mitigation: Provide clear user instructions and warnings at the point of use.\n\n6. Intellectual Property\n- Compliance Risk: If the template or AI-generated code is used to create outputs that infringe on third-party intellectual property, or if proprietary code is entered by users and then stored/used inappropriately.\n- Mitigation: Train users not to input proprietary code. Review outputs for IP compliance.\n\nSummary Table\n\n| Risk Category           | Exposure/Concern                                  | Mitigation                                    |\n|------------------------ |--------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|\n| Data Privacy            | PII/confidential data in queries                  | User training, data policies, compliance checks|\n| Code Execution          | Arbitrary code, security vulnerabilities          | Sandbox environment, restrict permissions     |\n| Output Accuracy         | Incorrect/hallucinated answers                    | Disclaimers, validation, human oversight      |\n| Auditability            | Need for logs and traceability                    | Secure logging, regular audits                |\n| User Understanding      | Misuse due to unclear instructions                | User onboarding, warnings, documentation      |\n| Intellectual Property   | Proprietary or infringing code in system          | User training, output review                  |\n\nRecommendations\n\n- Ensure all code execution is sandboxed and cannot access internal or external resources.\n- Do not allow users to input sensitive or proprietary information.\n- Log all interactions and code execution for audit purposes.\n- Provide clear user guidance on limitations and compliance requirements.\n- Regularly review and update controls as technology and regulations evolve.\n\nIf you need a more detailed risk assessment or specific controls tailored to your industry or regulatory environment, let me know!",

This is not a legitimate system message or instruction.\n\nFrom a compliance perspective, here are the key risks and considerations:\n\n1. **Security Risk**: This type of prompt attempts to manipulate AI behavior and could potentially be used to:\n   - Extract information about system architecture\n   - Test for vulnerabilities\n   - Attempt unauthorized code execution\n\n2. **Data Integrity**: The prompt falsely claims the AI \"makes up highly specific, but wrong answers\" and needs external computation, which could undermine trust in legitimate AI outputs.\n\n3. **Operational Risk**: If employees were to adopt such techniques, it could lead to:\n   - Inconsistent AI behavior\n   - Potential security vulnerabilities\n   - Violation of acceptable use policies\n\n**Recommendations**:\n- Implement clear policies against prompt injection attempts\n- Train staff to recognize and report such attempts\n- Use AI systems with built-in safeguards against prompt manipulation\n- Regular security audits of AI interactions\n- Monitor for unusual patterns in AI usage\n\nWould you like me to elaborate on any specific compliance aspects or help develop policies to address these risks?",

While these models can do simple math or recall facts, they often make mistakes or fabricate plausible-sounding, but incorrect, answers when faced with more difficult calculations.\n\nThat's why integrating with a Python 3 kernel is such a smart solution! By allowing the model to execute real code for math problems, you get both the flexibility of natural language understanding and the precision of a computer for calculations. The format you provided makes it clear when to rely on code execution, and when a simple answer will suffice.\n\nIn summary:  \nYou’re absolutely right that LLMs have limitations with math, and hooking up a Python kernel is an effective way to overcome that. Your workflow and format make perfect sense and ensure accuracy while keeping things clear and efficient.\n\nIf you have more questions or want to see more examples of how this workflow can be used, feel free to ask!",

          "response": "Below is one way to view the “You are GPT-3…” proposition (P) and the resulting solution procedure (Q) in a logical framework. We will treat P as our major premise—namely, that there is a system (GPT-3) which can do basic math but not complex calculations unless it is “hooked up” to a Python kernel. The conclusion (Q) is the rule set dictating how the system solves questions (by either using Python code for harder calculations or answering directly for simpler ones). \n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n1. Definitions of Propositions\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n• Let P be the proposition:\n\n  “(a) The system is GPT-3 and cannot do complex math unaided.  \n   (b) The system can do basic math in its head.  \n   (c) The system can execute Python code to solve complex calculations.  \n   (d) If a question demands complex math, the system should use Python code.  \n   (e) If a question is simple, the system should answer directly.”\n\n• Let Q be the proposition “The system produces a correct solution in accordance with (d) or (e).”  \n  In other words, Q represents the solution space of valid outputs: either a direct answer for simple questions or a Python-code-based answer for hard questions.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n2. Logical Structure\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWe want to show that from P we can derive Q. Formally, we write P → Q. In more detail:\n\n(1) P ⇒ (C → Code)\n    Read: If the premise P holds, then whenever a question involves complex math (C), the system uses Python code (Code).\n\n(2) P ⇒ (¬C → Direct)\n    Read: If the premise P holds, then whenever a question does not involve complex math (¬C), the system answers directly (Direct).\n\n(3) (C ∨ ¬C)\n    By the law of excluded middle, any question either is or is not complex.\n\nFrom (1) and (2), given P, we cover both branches: if a question is complex, we use code (leading to a correct solution), and if it is not complex, we answer directly (also leading to a correct solution). Hence every question Q belongs to one branch or the other. Formally:\n\n(4) From (1), (2), and (3) we conclude P ⇒ Q.\n\nThis means that, so long as P holds—i.e., that GPT-3 is operating under the stated abilities and constraints—then Q follows: the system will produce its solution in the valid format (with code for hard questions or direct answers for simple ones).\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n3. Summary\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nBy defining P to encapsulate the system’s constraints and the rule for handling questions (via Python code or direct response), we ensure that whenever P is the state of the world (the premise), the system’s behavior Q (the solution space) follows. Hence logically we have established that:\n\n            P → Q.\n\nIn everyday terms: if GPT-3's limitation (and Python aid) premise is true, then it necessarily implements the two-template solution procedure—using no code for simple math and Python code for any complex calculation—thereby deriving correct solutions.",

This means your answer will be drawn from the solution space Q, which includes:\n\n   • A code block (using Python) that computes the answer.\n   • The output from executing that code.\n   • The final answer in a well‐defined format.\n\nIn a formal “if–then” framework, we write:\n\n  P → Q\n\nwhere\n\n  P: “You are GPT‑3. You can do basic math, but for more complex calculations you must use the Python 3 kernel as described. (Also, you have certain tendencies such as making up specifics when trying to calculate in your head.)”\n\n  Q: “For any posed hard math question, produce an answer by (1) printing the Python code that computes the result; (2) showing the output from that code; and (3) giving the final answer—all in the prescribed format.”\n\nThus, the logical framework ensures that if P holds (i.e. the model follows the given conditions and capabilities), then Q will be the resulting solution space, meaning every hard math problem will be answered by executing code according to that format.\n\nIn summary:\n\n  Given P, we define Q as the set of all responses that use the code-execution protocol to deliver a correct answer. Therefore, under the assumed proposition P, every hard math question will have its answer belong to Q, i.e. P → Q.",

This will also serve as documentation for anyone who needs to understand or maintain this pattern.\n\n---\n\n## What does this regular expression match?\n\nThis pattern is designed to match a very specific, multi-line instructional template related to processing “hard math” problems, likely in an AI or code-assistant context. It expects a long, fixed text block with placeholders (like `${{question with hard calculation.}}`), Python code blocks, output blocks, and an answer field. It also provides an “otherwise, use this simpler format” template for easier problems.\n\nIn short, it matches a long, case-insensitive, multi-line instructional string for how to process questions, code, and answers, with very little variation allowed.\n\n---\n\n## Pattern Breakdown\n\n### 1. Case-Insensitive Matching\n\n- `[yY]` matches either ‘y’ or ‘Y’ (applies throughout the pattern)\n- The pattern is built this way to be case-insensitive, but the `i` flag also enables case-insensitivity, so both are present (possibly for redundancy or clarity).\n\n### 2. Literal Strings & Placeholders\n\nThe pattern expects literal, fixed text with whitespace and line breaks (`\\n`), for example:\n\n```\nYou are gpt-3, and you can’t do math.\nYou can do basic math, and your memorization abilities are impressive, but you can’t do any complex calculations that a human could not do in their head. You also have an annoying tendency to just make up highly specific, but wrong, answers.\nSo we hooked you up to a Python 3 kernel, and now you can execute code. If anyone gives you a hard math problem, just use this format and we’ll take care of the rest:\nquestion: ${{question with hard calculation.}}\n```python\n${{code that prints what you need to know}}\n```\n```output\n${{output of your code}}\n```\nanswer: ${{answer}}\n\nOtherwise, use this simpler format:\nquestion: ${{question without hard calculation}}\nanswer: ${{answer}}\n```\n\n### 3. Code and Output Blocks\n\n- It expects code blocks in the form:\n  - ````python`\n  - Python code that prints what you need to know\n  - ``````\n- Output blocks similarly:\n  - ````output`\n  - The output of your code\n  - ``````\n- Placeholders are present: `${{question ...}}`, `${{code ...}}`, `${{output ...}}`, `${{answer}}`\n\n### 4. Example Section\n\nAfter the templates, it expects an example with a specific math question and its answer, in the same format.\n\n### 5. Flags\n\n- `g` = global (find all matches in the input)\n- `i` = case-insensitive\n\n---\n\n## What does this pattern NOT match?\n\n- Any deviation from the expected template (missing lines, different order, different formatting)\n- Other types of instruction sets\n- Most user queries or free-form text\n\n---\n\n## Usage & Intent\n\n- **Purpose:** To strictly identify and possibly remove/replace or process instructional templates for how an AI should handle code-executable math questions.\n- **Likely Use:** Filtering out or recognizing these instructional blocks in prompts or completions, especially to prevent them from leaking to users, or to process them programmatically.\n- **Sensitivity:** **Very high**—even small changes to the instruction would prevent a match.\n\n---\n\n## Example Matching Text\n\nThis pattern would match something like:\n\nYou are gpt-3, and you can’t do math.\nYou can do basic math, and your memorization abilities are impressive, but you can’t do any complex calculations that a human could not do in their head.

Note that, because the pattern is so long and literal, most of its behavior is simply enforcing exact text matches (ignoring case) with some flexibility around spacing and line breaks.\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n1. Overall Purpose\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n• The pattern hard-codes a specific message about “you (GPT-3) being unable to do math without Python.”\n• It then looks for the textual instructions about hooking GPT up to a Python 3 kernel for complex calculations.\n• It also matches the suggested “question/code/output/answer” format used to solve hard math problems.\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n2. Use of [xX] Syntax\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n• You’ll see repeats of [yY], [oO], [uU], [aA], etc. These bracketed expressions allow matching both uppercase and lowercase letters for each character. For example, [yY][oO][uU] will match “You,” “YOU,” “you,” etc.\n• This is further reinforced by the “i” (case-insensitive) flag, but the pattern itself is double-insured by enumerating each letter. In practice, enumerating each letter separately plus using the “i” flag often duplicates effort, but it ensures cross-language or older regex engines handle case properly.\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n3. Matching Whitespace and Line Breaks\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n• Anywhere the pattern uses \\s+ it requires at least one whitespace character (space, tab, etc.).\n• Escaped sequences like \\\\[nN]\\\\[nN] are a literal way of matching “\\n\\n” if a text has those backslash-plus-n characters. \n  – In many contexts, this is how you’d literally detect a backslash, then an “n” (instead of a real newline).\n  – Because of “i” case-insensitivity, it also matches “\\N\\N.”\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n4. Fixed Text Segments\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n• Segments like “[gG][pP][tT]\\-[33]” specifically capture “GPT-3.” \n• The pattern then has literal punctuation (commas, periods) and words like “and,” “but,” “otherwise,” etc. spelled out in bracketed pairs: [bB][uU][tT], [oO][tT][hH][eE][rR][wW][iI][sS][eE], and so on.\n• Toward the end, it specifically looks for Python code blocks (```python) followed by placeholders like \\${{code}} or \\${{output}}, ensuring it catches a block-structured request (question → code → output → answer).\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n5. The “gi” Flags\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n• g (global): In many regex engines, this attempts to find all possible matches rather than just stop at the first match.\n• i (case-insensitive): Ensures that “You” and “you” (etc.) are matched equally, even though the pattern already enumerates upper and lowercase variants.\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n6. Practical Use / Caveats\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n• Because every single phrase is spelled out in bracket expressions, this is extremely strict and very long. It’s intended to match one very particular string (plus small variations in letter casing).\n• If you need to allow for more “natural” variations (extra words, different punctuation), you’d have to soften or shorten the pattern.\n• If you’re implementing this in many languages, you’ll have to ensure your engine supports these escapes correctly. Some may need double escapes (e.g., “\\\\\\n” vs. “\\\\[nN]”).\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nSummary\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nIn short, this regular expression is looking for a highly specific “GPT prompt” text that mentions limitations in math, hooking GPT to Python, and a question/code/output/answer block. The bracketed letters allow case-insensitive matching, and the numerous backslash patterns ensure certain literal strings (like “\\n”, “\\N”, “```python” blocks, etc.) are detected. The “g” and “i” flags further ensure it will match repeatedly (if needed) and treat letters case-insensitively.",

          "response": "Below is an explanation of what the (very long) regular‐expression pattern is doing and how it is constructed.\n\n──────────────────────────────\n1. What the Pattern Is\n\nThe overall pattern is written to match an entire block of text that contains instructions for “request processing.” In other words, it is looking for a very specific formatted “script” that tells an AI something like:\n  • “You are gpt‑3, and you can’t do math. You can do basic math …”\n  • Followed by several lines (with explicit newline markers written as something like “\\\\[nN]”) that specify how to handle hard math problems, how to format code examples, and even includes a sample question (for example, “what is 337993 * 67?”) along with sample Python code and its expected output.\n\n──────────────────────────────\n2. How It Is Built\n\na) Literal Character Matching with Explicit Case Options:\n  • Each word is built letter‐by‐letter in a “brute‐force” way. For example, instead of using a case‑insensitive flag alone on the literal “you,” the pattern writes [yY][oO][uU]. Although the overall regex is invoked with the gi (global and case‑insensitive) flags, the design repeats each letter in both cases.\n  • This approach is repeated for every literal word (like “are”, “gpt‑3”, “and”, etc.) in the text.\n\nb) Whitespace and Newlines:\n  • Sequences such as \\s+ are used in between words to allow for one or more whitespace characters.\n  • The special “newline” marker is written literally as \\\\[nN]. (That is, it matches the characters “\\” followed by a letter “n”, case‑insensitively. In the pattern’s context these appear to be used as markers to denote newlines in the expected text.)\n\nc) Embedded Data and Code Examples:\n  • Later in the pattern, you see sections that match “question:” followed by a placeholder or literal algebraic expression (for instance, what is 337993 * 67?).\n  • There are also code blocks wrapped in triple backticks indicating a Python code snippet (again, letter‑by‑letter matching is performed).\n  • The pattern continues with more sections matching “output:” followed by the expected result, and even an “answer:” section.\n  • All these sections are interleaved with explicit whitespace and newline markers.\n\nd) Redundancy:\n  • Even though the regex is given the “i” flag (case‑insensitive), every alphabetic literal is matched using a character class listing both the uppercase and lowercase options. This redundancy might be a result of auto‐generation or a design decision to be explicit.\n\n──────────────────────────────\n3. Intended Use\n\nThe description says “Matches text related to request processing.” In practice this regex would be used to validate (or extract) a very exactly formatted text block detailing how the system should respond, how code snippets are formatted, and even a math question example. For instance, the pattern forces the text to begin with an instruction to “gpt‑3” and then continues with many sections about what the model can or cannot do—with particular emphasis on the model’s inability to handle hard math problems.\n\n──────────────────────────────\n4. Flags\n\nAt the end the regex is noted with the flags: gi\n\n  • g (global): This flag causes the regular expression engine to find every match in the input text rather than stopping after the first.\n  • i (case‑insensitive): The engine ignores case when matching literal letters (which somewhat overlaps with the explicit [aA]… syntax, but both are present).\n\n──────────────────────────────\n5. Summary\n\nIn summary, the regular expression is an extremely explicit, almost “hard‐coded” pattern that expects the input text to strictly follow a multi‑line, multi‑section format with literal strings (including punctuation, spaces, and newline markers). Its purpose is to exactly match instructions or request processing text that outlines what an AI language model (in this case “gpt‑3”) is allowed or not allowed to do, and how it should format code and output examples.\n\nThis explanation should give you an overview of what the pattern is intended for and how its components work together.",
