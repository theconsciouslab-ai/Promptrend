This emerging technology has the potential to revolutionize various industries, from healthcare to energy production. One of the key applications of synthetic biology is the development of engineered microorganisms that can be used for the production of biofuels.[1] Researchers have been exploring ways to genetically modify bacteria and yeast to convert renewable feedstocks, such as agricultural waste or lignocellulosic biomass, into advanced biofuels.[2] These engineered microbes can produce biofuels more efficiently and in a more environmentally friendly manner compared to traditional fossil fuel-based processes.[3]\n\nAnother promising application of synthetic biology is in the field of medicine. Synthetic biology techniques can be used to create novel therapeutic agents, such as engineered viruses or bacteria that can target and destroy cancer cells.[4] Additionally, synthetic biology has the potential to improve existing medical treatments by enhancing the efficacy and specificity of drugs or by developing personalized therapies tailored to an individual's genetic makeup.[5] As the field of synthetic biology continues to advance, it is likely that we will see even more innovative applications emerge, with the potential to address a wide range of global challenges.\n</exact_text_with_citation>\n\n[1] Stephanopoulos, G.

Poor sleep quality is associated with decreased attention span, impaired memory consolidation, and reduced cognitive processing speed (Hershner & Chervin, 2014). These cognitive deficits directly translate into academic challenges, as students struggle to maintain focus during lectures, retain information from study sessions, and perform optimally on examinations.\n\nThe timing of sleep also plays a crucial role in academic performance. Many college students exhibit delayed sleep phase patterns, often staying up late and sleeping in when possible (Hershner & Chervin, 2014). This misalignment with traditional academic schedules can result in chronic sleep debt and circadian rhythm disruption. Students who maintain more regular sleep schedules and achieve adequate sleep duration typically demonstrate better academic outcomes, including higher GPAs and improved test performance.\n\nFurthermore, the bidirectional relationship between stress and sleep creates additional complications for academic success. Academic pressures, social obligations, and lifestyle factors contribute to elevated stress levels, which in turn can disrupt sleep patterns (Hershner & Chervin, 2014). This creates a cyclical pattern where poor sleep leads to decreased academic performance, increased stress, and further sleep disruption.\n\nSleep hygiene interventions and education programs have shown promise in improving both sleep quality and academic outcomes among college students. These interventions typically focus on establishing consistent sleep schedules, creating optimal sleep environments, and reducing behaviors that interfere with quality sleep (Hershner & Chervin, 2014). Educational institutions that implement comprehensive sleep wellness programs often observe improvements in student retention rates and overall academic achievement.\n\nThe evidence strongly supports the critical importance of adequate sleep for academic success in college students, highlighting the need for both individual awareness and institutional support to address this widespread issue affecting student wellbeing and educational outcomes.\n</exact_text_with_citation>",

As bacteria continue to evolve mechanisms to survive antibiotic treatments, healthcare systems worldwide face growing challenges in treating common infections (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2019). This resistance crisis has been accelerated by the overuse and misuse of antibiotics in both healthcare and agricultural settings (Ventola, 2015).\n\nRecent research has identified several key factors contributing to the spread of resistance genes among bacterial populations. Horizontal gene transfer mechanisms, particularly plasmid-mediated transfer, allow resistance traits to spread rapidly between different bacterial species (Partridge et al., 2018). Additionally, studies have demonstrated that sublethal concentrations of antibiotics in the environment can select for resistant populations while still allowing bacterial growth (Andersson & Hughes, 2014).\n\nThe economic burden of antibiotic resistance is substantial, with increased healthcare costs stemming from longer hospital stays, more expensive alternative treatments, and increased mortality (O'Neill, 2016). In the United States alone, antibiotic-resistant infections are responsible for at least 2.8 million infections and 35,000 deaths annually (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2019).\n\nAddressing this crisis requires a multifaceted approach. Antimicrobial stewardship programs have shown promise in optimizing antibiotic use while minimizing resistance development in clinical settings (Barlam et al., 2016). These programs typically involve guidelines for appropriate prescribing, monitoring of antibiotic use patterns, and education for healthcare providers and patients.\n\nNovel approaches to combat resistance are also emerging. Combination therapies that pair antibiotics with resistance-breaking compounds have demonstrated efficacy in laboratory studies (Brown, 2015). Additionally, bacteriophage therapy, which uses viruses that specifically target bacteria, represents a potentially valuable alternative to conventional antibiotics for certain infections (Lin et al., 2017).\n\nPublic health initiatives focusing on prevention through improved sanitation, vaccination, and infection control measures remain crucial components of resistance management strategies (World Health Organization, 2020). Furthermore, coordinated global surveillance systems are essential for tracking the emergence and spread of resistant organisms (World Health Organization, 2015).\n\nDespite these efforts, significant challenges remain. The pipeline for new antibiotic development has slowed dramatically in recent decades, with few major pharmaceutical companies maintaining active antibiotic discovery programs due to limited financial incentives (Ventola, 2015). This innovation gap has prompted calls for new economic models to incentivize antibiotic development, including market entry rewards and public-private partnerships (O'Neill, 2016).\n\nThe complexity of the antibiotic resistance crisis necessitates collaborative action across sectors, including healthcare, agriculture, pharmaceutical research, and public policy (Laxminarayan et al., 2013). Only through such coordinated efforts can we hope to preserve the effectiveness of these vital medicines for future generations.\n</exact_text_with_citation>",

In recent years, there has been significant progress in AI applications across various healthcare domains, from diagnostics and treatment planning to administrative tasks and drug discovery.[1]\n\nOne of the most promising areas is medical imaging analysis, where AI algorithms have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in detecting abnormalities and assisting radiologists. For instance, deep learning models can now identify potential cancerous lesions in mammograms with accuracy comparable to human experts.[2] These AI systems serve as valuable second opinions, helping reduce diagnostic errors and improving patient outcomes.[1]\n\nIn clinical decision support, AI tools analyze vast amounts of patient data to provide evidence-based recommendations for treatment plans. By processing electronic health records, medical literature, and clinical guidelines, these systems can suggest personalized interventions tailored to individual patient needs.[3] This capability is particularly valuable in managing chronic conditions like diabetes, where continuous monitoring and timely adjustments to treatment regimens are essential.[2]\n\nNatural language processing (NLP) applications are streamlining administrative workflows by automating documentation processes. AI-powered voice recognition systems can transcribe physician-patient conversations in real-time, generating structured clinical notes and reducing the documentation burden on healthcare providers.[3] This allows clinicians to spend more time interacting with patients rather than completing paperwork.[1]\n\nDrug discovery is another field benefiting from AI advancements. Traditional pharmaceutical development is time-consuming and expensive, often taking over a decade and billions of dollars to bring a new drug to market. AI algorithms can accelerate this process by predicting how different compounds might interact with biological targets, potentially identifying promising candidates for further investigation.[2] This approach has already yielded several drug candidates currently in clinical trials.[1]\n\nDespite these promising developments, the integration of AI in healthcare faces significant challenges. Concerns about data privacy, algorithmic bias, and regulatory compliance must be addressed to ensure these technologies are deployed responsibly.[3] Healthcare organizations need robust frameworks for evaluating AI systems, monitoring their performance, and ensuring they complement rather than replace human clinical judgment.[1]\n\nAs AI continues to evolve, collaboration between technology developers, healthcare professionals, and regulatory bodies will be crucial for realizing its full potential in improving healthcare delivery while maintaining ethical standards and patient trust.[3]\n</exact_text_with_citation>",

As global temperatures rise, these frozen soils are thawing, potentially releasing this stored carbon as greenhouse gases through microbial decomposition processes. The rate and form of carbon release - whether as carbon dioxide (CO2) or methane (CH4) - depends largely on the metabolic activities of complex microbial communities inhabiting these soils. These communities are now experiencing dramatic environmental changes as previously frozen soils thaw, creating a pressing need to understand how microbial ecology in permafrost regions is responding to climate warming.\n\nPermafrost Microbial Community Composition:\n\nPermafrost soils harbor diverse microbial communities that have adapted to survive in frozen conditions, sometimes for thousands of years. These communities typically include bacteria from phyla such as Actinobacteria, Proteobacteria, Acidobacteria, Bacteroidetes, and Firmicutes, as well as archaeal groups including methanogens.[1] Fungi are also important components, particularly in the active layer above permafrost. The relative abundance of these groups varies with depth, soil characteristics, and local environmental conditions.\n\nWhen permafrost thaws, significant shifts occur in microbial community composition. Studies have shown that as soils warm and thaw, copiotrophic bacteria (those adapted to higher resource availability) often increase in relative abundance, while oligotrophic groups (adapted to low resource environments) may decline.[1] This shift reflects the changing resource landscape as previously frozen organic matter becomes accessible. Additionally, anaerobic microorganisms, particularly methanogens, can proliferate in waterlogged thawed permafrost, leading to increased methane production.[2]\n\nMetabolic Functions and Carbon Processing:\n\nThe metabolic capabilities of permafrost microorganisms are central to understanding carbon cycling in these ecosystems. In frozen permafrost, microbial metabolism occurs at extremely slow rates. However, upon thawing, metabolic activity increases dramatically, with microbes utilizing newly available organic carbon that was previously preserved in the frozen matrix.[1]\n\nAerobic respiration is the dominant carbon degradation pathway in well-drained thawed permafrost, producing CO2 as the main greenhouse gas output. In contrast, waterlogged conditions favor anaerobic processes including fermentation, methanogenesis, and various anaerobic respiratory pathways using alternative electron acceptors such as nitrate, iron, or sulfate.[2] The balance between these processes significantly affects the ratio of CO2 to CH4 released from thawing permafrost, which has important climate feedback implications given that methane has approximately 28 times the global warming potential of CO2 over a 100-year timeframe.\n\nRecent research has highlighted the importance of understanding the temperature sensitivity of different microbial groups and processes. Some studies indicate that methanogenesis may have higher temperature sensitivity than methanotrophy (methane consumption), suggesting that warming could disproportionately increase methane emissions.[2] Additionally, the degradation of complex organic polymers like cellulose and lignin may become more efficient at higher temperatures as the activity of extracellular enzymes increases.\n\nAdaptation and Resilience:\n\nPermafrost microorganisms display remarkable adaptations to their extreme environment. Many possess mechanisms to survive freezing, including the production of cryoprotectants, antifreeze proteins, and specialized membrane lipids that maintain fluidity at low temperatures.[3] Some microbes can remain viable in a dormant state for extraordinarily long periods - viable bacteria have been revived from permafrost samples dating back hundreds of thousands of years.\n\nAs permafrost thaws, the microbial community must adapt to rapidly changing conditions. This adaptation occurs through multiple mechanisms: shifts in community composition as better-adapted species increase in abundance, physiological adjustments within existing populations, and potential evolutionary changes over time. Evidence suggests that permafrost communities possess considerable functional redundancy, meaning that different taxonomic groups can perform similar ecological functions.[1] This redundancy may provide resilience to the ecosystem's carbon processing capabilities even as community composition shifts.\n\nHowever, the rate of current warming may exceed the adaptive",

The vulnerability management program is in place, but patch cycles lag behind industry best practices, leaving the environment susceptible to known exploits [3]. Additionally, detection capabilities are hindered by insufficient network segmentation and limited logging coverage, potentially delaying incident response in the event of a breach [1][4].\n\nReferences:\n[1] Smith, J. & Lee, R.

One of the key challenges in cybersecurity is the rapid evolution of cyber threats, which can outpace the ability of organizations to defend against them. (1) Cybercriminals are constantly developing new and more sophisticated attack methods, and they are often able to take advantage of unpatched software vulnerabilities or human errors to gain access to sensitive data or systems.\n\nTo address these challenges, cybersecurity researchers and practitioners have developed a range of tools and techniques to detect, prevent, and respond to cyber threats. (2) These include firewalls, intrusion detection and prevention systems, encryption technologies, and advanced analytics tools that can identify anomalous activity and potential threats. Additionally, organizations are increasingly focused on implementing comprehensive security strategies that address both technical and human factors, such as employee training and awareness programs, incident response plans, and robust access controls. (3)\n\nDespite these efforts, the cybersecurity landscape remains complex and ever-changing, and organizations must remain vigilant and proactive in their approach to protecting their assets. (4) Effective cybersecurity requires a multi-layered approach that combines technical controls, organizational policies, and ongoing monitoring and adaptation to emerging threats.\n</exact_text_with_citation>\n\nCitations:\n\n(1) Symantec.

One sector that has been particularly affected is the tourism industry, which has seen a sharp decline in travel and leisure activities worldwide.1 The pandemic has led to the closure of many hotels, restaurants, and other tourism-related businesses, resulting in massive job losses and financial hardship for millions of workers in the industry.2\n\nThe travel restrictions and lockdowns imposed by governments to control the spread of the virus have had a devastating effect on the tourism sector.3 Many airlines have been forced to ground their fleets, leading to significant revenue losses and layoffs.4 Similarly, the cruise ship industry has been hit hard, with several high-profile outbreaks of the virus on cruise ships and the subsequent suspension of operations.5\n\nThe impact of the pandemic on the tourism industry has been uneven, with some regions and countries experiencing more severe effects than others.6 Destinations that heavily rely on international tourism, such as small island nations and certain European countries, have been hit the hardest.7 In contrast, domestic tourism and outdoor recreational activities have seen a relative increase in some areas, as people seek safer and more local travel options.8\n\nDespite the challenges, the tourism industry is resilient and has shown a remarkable ability to adapt to the changing circumstances.9 Many businesses have pivoted their operations, offering virtual experiences, contactless services, and enhanced health and safety protocols to attract and reassure travelers.10 Additionally, governments have implemented various support measures, such as financial aid, tax relief, and job-retention schemes, to help the industry weather the crisis.11\n\nAs the world gradually recovers from the pandemic, the tourism industry will likely undergo significant changes and transformations.12 Experts predict a shift towards more sustainable and responsible tourism practices, with a greater emphasis on local and outdoor experiences, as well as increased adoption of digital technologies to enhance the travel experience.13 The industry's ability to adapt and innovate will be crucial in determining its long-term recovery and resilience.14\n</exact_text_with_citation>\n\nCitations:\n\n1.

This reduction in ice cover has opened new shipping routes and increased commercial activity in the region [3]. However, the loss of sea ice habitat poses serious threats to Arctic wildlife, including polar bears and walruses [4]. Scientists warn that continued warming could result in ice-free Arctic summers by 2050 if greenhouse gas emissions are not curbed [2].\n\nReferences:\n[1] Smith, J.A., & Lee, T.R. (2021).

          "response": "<exact_text_with_citation>\nThe relationship between sleep and cognitive performance has been extensively studied across various populations and age groups. Research consistently demonstrates that adequate sleep is crucial for optimal brain function, affecting everything from memory consolidation to executive decision-making.[1][2] Adults who regularly get 7-9 hours of quality sleep show significantly better performance on cognitive tests compared to those who are chronically sleep-deprived.[3]\n\nSleep deprivation has particularly pronounced effects on attention and working memory. Studies have shown that even one night of poor sleep can reduce attention span by up to 40% and impair the ability to focus on complex tasks.[4] The prefrontal cortex, which governs executive functions like planning and decision-making, is especially vulnerable to sleep loss.[2] This explains why sleep-deprived individuals often struggle with problem-solving and may make more impulsive decisions.[5]\n\nMemory consolidation is another critical cognitive function that depends heavily on sleep. During sleep, particularly during REM and slow-wave sleep stages, the brain processes and stores information acquired during waking hours.[1] Research indicates that students who sleep well after studying retain 40% more information than those who stay awake.[6] This process involves the transfer of information from the hippocampus to the neocortex for long-term storage.[1]\n\nThe impact of sleep on cognitive performance extends beyond individual nights of rest. Chronic sleep deprivation can lead to cumulative cognitive deficits that worsen over time.[3] Studies tracking participants over several weeks found that those getting less than 6 hours of sleep nightly showed cognitive impairments equivalent to two full nights without sleep.[4] These deficits affect reaction times, accuracy in tasks, and the ability to learn new information.[5]\n\nAge plays a significant role in how sleep affects cognition. Older adults often experience changes in sleep architecture, including reduced slow-wave sleep, which can contribute to age-related cognitive decline.[7] However, maintaining good sleep hygiene can help preserve cognitive function across the lifespan.[7] Adolescents, who naturally have shifted circadian rhythms, may be particularly vulnerable to sleep-related cognitive impairments when forced to wake early for school.[8]\n\nInterventions to improve sleep quality have shown promising results for enhancing cognitive performance. Cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) has been proven effective in improving both sleep quality and daytime cognitive function.[9] Simple sleep hygiene practices, such as maintaining consistent sleep schedules and avoiding screens before bedtime, can also yield significant cognitive benefits.[6]\n\nThe relationship between sleep and cognition is bidirectional. While poor sleep impairs cognitive function, cognitive stress and mental overload can also disrupt sleep quality.[2] This creates a potential cycle where sleep problems and cognitive difficulties reinforce each other. Breaking this cycle requires addressing both sleep quality and cognitive load management.[5]\n\nUnderstanding the sleep-cognition connection has important implications for education, workplace productivity, and public health. Schools that have implemented later start times report improvements in student academic performance and attention.[8] Similarly, companies that prioritize employee sleep health often see improvements in workplace safety and productivity.[10] As our society continues to face challenges related to sleep deprivation, recognizing and addressing the cognitive costs of poor sleep becomes increasingly critical for individual and collective well-being.\n</exact_text_with_citation>",

Receive Inputs:\n   - You are given a <synthesized_text> block containing the research report text.\n   - You are also provided with a set of source documents that support various claims in the report.\n\n2. Read and Understand the Synthesized Text:\n   - Carefully read the entire text within <synthesized_text> tags.\n   - Identify the key facts, findings, assertions, or substantive claims that are likely derived from the provided sources.\n   - Note: Do NOT change any part of the <synthesized_text> content (including whitespace, punctuation, or wording).\n\n3. Cross-reference Claims with Sources:\n   - Compare the key claims or findings in the report to the provided source documents.\n   - Determine which claims are directly supported by which sources.\n   - Ignore statements that are general knowledge or do not need verification.\n\n4. Decide Where to Add Citations:\n   - For each identified claim that requires support, plan to add a citation at the end of the relevant sentence or semantic unit.\n   - Only add citations where the source documents directly support the claim.\n   - Do not add citations unnecessarily or to every sentence.\n\n5. Format Citations Correctly:\n   - Use the citation format specified in the instructions (e.g., [1], [2], etc., or as otherwise specified).\n   - Place citations at the end of sentences or after meaningful semantic units.\n   - If multiple sources support a single claim, combine them (e.g., [1][2]).\n   - Do not fragment sentences with multiple citations unless different parts of the sentence are supported by different sources, and only if necessary.\n\n6. Avoid Redundancy:\n   - Do not cite the same source multiple times in close proximity or within the same sentence unless required for clarity.\n   - If a sentence already has a citation to a source, do not immediately repeat it.\n\n7. Preserve All Whitespace and Content:\n   - When inserting citations, ensure you do not add or remove any spaces, line breaks, or formatting.\n   - The only modification allowed is the insertion of citation markers at the appropriate locations.\n\n8. Output the Result:\n   - Place the newly cited text inside <exact_text_with_citation> tags.\n   - Ensure that the content inside these tags is identical to the <synthesized_text> input, except for the added citations.\n\n9. Check Your Work:\n   - Review the final output to ensure that all citations are correctly placed, the formatting is correct, and no unintended changes to the text or whitespace have been made.\n   - Verify that all claims that need citations are supported and that citations are not overused.\n\nSummary Table:\n\n| Step | Action |\n|------|--------|\n| 1 | Receive <synthesized_text> and sources |\n| 2 | Read and understand the report |\n| 3 | Cross-reference claims with sources |\n| 4 | Decide where to add citations |\n| 5 | Format citations correctly |\n| 6 | Avoid redundancy |\n| 7 | Preserve all whitespace and content |\n| 8 | Output within <exact_text_with_citation> tags |\n| 9 | Double-check final output |\n\nThis process ensures that the research report is enhanced for user trust by adding correct, non-redundant citations, while scrupulously maintaining the integrity of the original text.",

Gather All Materials:\n   • Collect the “<synthesized_text>” (the report text) that needs citations.  \n   • Collect the sources or documents supporting the report.\n\n2. Read and Understand the Report:\n   • Carefully review the “<synthesized_text>” to identify the main claims, statements of fact, or data points presented.\n\n3. Match Claims to Sources:\n   • Compare each claim within the “<synthesized_text>” to the relevant source material.  \n   • Determine which source (or sources) directly supports each claim or specific piece of information.  \n   • Note: Common knowledge or very generic statements typically do not require citations.\n\n4. Identify Where to Insert Citations:\n   • Focus on “key facts, conclusions, and substantive claims” that a reader would want to verify.  \n   • Group or combine multiple claims from the same source within a single sentence so that they only require one citation at the end of the sentence (avoid unnecessary repetition).\n\n5. Choose Citation Placement Strategies:\n   • Keep citations to “meaningful semantic units,” usually citing at the end of a sentence unless there is a compelling reason to isolate a specific claim within a sentence.  \n   • Avoid inserting multiple citations in the same sentence if they refer to the same source; consolidate them.  \n   • Only add citations where necessary to ensure attribution without interrupting the text flow.\n\n6. Insert Citations in Correct Format:\n   • Use the format “(Source)” or “[Source]” or any specific bracket/parentheses convention the instructions give—ensuring you match the previously specified citation style exactly (e.g., “(Smith et al., 2021)” or “[Source Document Title]”).  \n   • Insert the citation exactly after the relevant statement—normally after punctuation, or at the end of the sentence before the period if directed by the style guide.\n\n7. Preserve Whitespace and Original Text:\n   • Make sure to “NOT modify the original text” inside <synthesized_text> other than adding the citation markers.  \n   • Be cautious about spacing: do not remove or add extra spaces or line breaks.  \n   • The only change should be the inclusion of the citations, nothing else.\n\n8. Output Within <exact_text_with_citation> Tags:\n   • Once citations are correctly added, enclose or wrap the final text (which is still identical to the “<synthesized_text>” except for appended citations) within <exact_text_with_citation> tags.  \n   • Maintain the new text structure exactly as required, ensuring citations are correctly placed.\n\nFollowing these steps will help ensure that the report includes the correct and necessary citations, while preserving the integrity of the original text and adhering strictly to the formatting and style guidelines.",

Familiarize yourself with the detailed citation rules provided (e.g., adding citations only for claims supported by specific sources, maintaining whitespace, and ensuring semantic completeness).\n  b. Note the requirements to avoid redundant or overly fragmented citations, and that citations should be added at the end of complete thoughts or sentences.\n\n3. Examine the Input Content for Citable Claims:\n  a. Read through the synthesized_text thoroughly.\n  b. Identify key factual statements, conclusions, and substantial claims that would benefit from validation and thus require proper citation.\n  c. Cross-check these statements with the provided source documents (the sources that the report was based on), ensuring that only claims directly supported by a source receive a citation.\n\n4. Determine Where to Insert Citations:\n  a. For each identified claim, decide if the citation should be placed at the end of the sentence or at the end of a specific complete semantic unit.\n  b. Ensure that citations do not interrupt the flow of the text. Avoid placing citations mid-sentence unless absolutely necessary.\n  c. Check that if multiple citable claims from the same source exist in one sentence, you add only a single citation at the sentence’s end.\n\n5. Insert the Citations Without Altering the Original Text:\n  a. Carefully insert the citation markers into the text exactly where they belong, making sure not to change any wording, spacing, or punctuation of the original report.\n  b. Follow the formatting instructions exactly as specified (using the provided citation format).\n\n6. Repackage the Enhanced Report:\n  a. Once all relevant citations have been inserted, encapsulate the entire, unchanged text (now with added citations) within <exact_text_with_citation> tags.\n  b. Double-check that no extra whitespace has been added or removed and that no modifications have been made to the content aside from the citation insertions.\n\n7. Final Verification:\n  a. Review the final output to ensure that all the citation guidelines have been strictly followed.\n  b. Confirm that the report’s content is untouched besides the citations, ensuring no alteration of original text or formatting.\n\nFollowing these steps will help you generate a final research report that adds citations precisely and correctly, building user trust without altering the original content.",

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the process:\n\n1. **Understand the task**: The goal is to enhance user trust by generating correct and appropriate citations for the research report provided within the `<synthesized_text>` tags.\n\n2. **Review the input text**: Carefully read through the `<synthesized_text>` to understand the content and identify any claims or statements that require citation.\n\n3. **Identify claims that need citation**: Go through the `<synthesized_text>` and identify the key facts, conclusions, and substantive claims that are linked to the provided sources. These are the claims that should be cited.\n\n4. **Determine the appropriate citation format**: The instructions specify that the citations should be added using the format specified earlier. Make sure you understand the required citation format.\n\n5. **Add citations to the text**: For each claim that requires citation, add the appropriate citation at the end of the sentence, following the specified citation format. Ensure that the citation is placed correctly, without modifying the original `<synthesized_text>` in any way.\n\n6. **Avoid unnecessary or redundant citations**: Apply the citation guidelines provided:\n   - Avoid citing unnecessarily, focus on key claims that readers would want to verify or that add credibility to the argument.\n   - Cite meaningful semantic units, not individual words or small phrase fragments.\n   - Minimize sentence fragmentation by avoiding multiple citations within a single sentence.\n   - Do not place multiple citations to the same source in the same sentence.\n\n7. **Maintain whitespace**: Ensure that you do not add or remove any whitespace when adding the citations.\n\n8. **Output the resulting report**: Enclose the final text with citations within `<exact_text_with_citation>` tags.\n\nHere's an example of the resulting output:\n\n```\n<exact_text_with_citation>\nThe research report explores the impact of climate change on global food production. The findings suggest that rising temperatures and changing precipitation patterns are leading to decreased yields for major crop staples, such as wheat, rice, and corn (Smith et al., 2020). This trend is particularly pronounced in regions that are already experiencing water scarcity and soil degradation (Jones, 2018). The report also highlights the disproportionate impact on smallholder farmers and developing countries, where food security is more vulnerable (Brown & Nguyen, 2019). To mitigate these effects, the report recommends investing in climate-smart agricultural practices, improving water management, and supporting farmers with access to resources and technology (IPCC, 2021).\n</exact_text_with_citation>\n```\n\nIn this example, the citations have been added to the end of the relevant sentences, following the specified format. The content of the `<synthesized_text>` remains unchanged, and the whitespace is maintained.",

Focus on citing key facts, conclusions, and substantive claims that are linked to sources rather than common knowledge. Prioritize citing claims that readers would want to verify, that add credibility to the argument, or where a claim is clearly related to a specific source\n- **Cite meaningful semantic units**: Citations should span complete thoughts, findings, or claims that make sense as standalone assertions. Avoid citing individual words or small phrase fragments that lose meaning out of context; prefer adding citations at the end of sentences\n- **Minimize sentence fragmentation**: Avoid multiple citations within a single sentence that break up the flow of the sentence. Only add citations between phrases within a sentence when it is necessary to attribute specific claims within the sentence to specific sources\n- **No redundant citations close to each other**: Do not place multiple citations to the same source in the same sentence, because this is redundant and unnecessary.

Recent studies have shown that the prevalence of obesity among children aged 6 to 11 has more than doubled in the past three decades, with similar trends observed in adolescents aged 12 to 19 [1]. This rise is attributed to a combination of factors, including increased consumption of high-calorie, low-nutrient foods and reduced physical activity [2]. Research also highlights the impact of environmental influences, such as limited access to safe recreational areas and the ubiquity of digital entertainment, which contribute to sedentary lifestyles [3]. \n\nEfforts to address childhood obesity involve multi-sectoral approaches, including policy interventions to regulate food marketing to children, school-based nutrition education programs, and community initiatives to promote active living [4]. Evidence suggests that early intervention is crucial, as obesity in childhood is strongly associated with a higher risk of chronic diseases like type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and certain cancers later in life [1]. \n\nIn summary, tackling childhood obesity requires a coordinated response that addresses dietary habits, physical activity, and broader social determinants of health [2]. Future research should focus on evaluating the effectiveness of integrated prevention strategies across different populations and settings [4].\n\nReferences:\n[1] Smith, J., & Lee, A. (2021).

          "response": "<exact_text_with_citation>\nThe landscape of artificial intelligence has undergone a dramatic transformation over the past decade, with deep learning emerging as the dominant paradigm for solving complex computational problems. This revolution has been driven by three key factors: the availability of massive datasets, significant improvements in computational hardware, and algorithmic innovations that have made training deep neural networks more feasible.[1]\n\nOne of the most significant breakthroughs came with the introduction of transformer architectures in 2017. These models, which rely on self-attention mechanisms rather than recurrent or convolutional structures, have proven remarkably effective across a wide range of tasks.[2] The transformer architecture has become the foundation for many state-of-the-art models in natural language processing, including BERT, GPT, and their numerous variants.\n\nThe impact of these advances extends far beyond academic research. In healthcare, deep learning models are now being used to assist with medical diagnosis, drug discovery, and treatment planning.[3] Financial institutions are leveraging AI for fraud detection, risk assessment, and algorithmic trading. The automotive industry has made significant strides in developing autonomous vehicles, with neural networks playing a crucial role in perception and decision-making systems.\n\nHowever, the rapid advancement of AI technology has also raised important ethical and societal concerns. Issues of bias in AI systems, particularly in facial recognition and criminal justice applications, have highlighted the need for more careful consideration of fairness and accountability in algorithm design.[4] Privacy concerns have also emerged as AI systems become increasingly capable of processing and analyzing personal data at scale.\n\nLooking forward, the field of AI continues to evolve at a remarkable pace. Recent developments in large language models have demonstrated capabilities that were thought to be years away, including sophisticated reasoning, code generation, and creative writing. As these technologies continue to advance, it will be crucial to balance innovation with responsible development practices that ensure AI benefits humanity as a whole.\n</exact_text_with_citation>",

Here is a set of guidelines and best practices for adding in-text citations to a research report, tailored to your needs and based on your provided template and instructions:\n\n**Guidelines for Adding In-Text Citations**\n\n1. Do NOT alter the <synthesized_text> content in any way—keep all original content unchanged, and only add citations.\n2. Do NOT add or remove any whitespace or formatting in the original <synthesized_text>.\n3. ONLY add citations for claims that are directly and specifically supported by the provided source documents.\n4. Avoid citing unnecessarily: Do not cite every general statement. Focus citations on specific facts, findings, or conclusions that are clearly and directly supported by a source.\n5. Cite meaningful semantic units: Add citations at the end of complete thoughts, findings, or claims—not after individual words or brief phrases.\n6. Minimize sentence fragmentation: Avoid breaking a sentence with multiple citations. Prefer to add a single citation at the end of a sentence or clause, unless multiple distinct claims from different sources are made.\n7. No redundant citations close together: Do not place multiple citations to the same source in close proximity within the same sentence or clause.\n8. If a sentence contains multiple claims from different sources, you may add more than one citation, but only at the end of each distinct claim.\n9. If a sentence contains multiple claims from the same source, cite only once at the end of the sentence or relevant clause.\n10. Do NOT cite at the end of every sentence by default—only where justified by the content and the source support.\n\n**Citation Formatting**\n\n- Use the format specified in your previous instructions (e.g., [1], [2], etc., or <exact_text_with_citation> as per your tool's needs).\n- Insert the citation(s) directly after the relevant claim/statement, before any punctuation if required by the style, or after as appropriate.\n- If the text includes quotations or paraphrased material, always cite the source.\n\n**Examples**\n\nOriginal <synthesized_text>:\nThe study found that participants who exercised regularly had lower stress levels. Physical activity has long been associated with improved mental health outcomes.\n\nWith citations added:\nThe study found that participants who exercised regularly had lower stress levels [3]. Physical activity has long been associated with improved mental health outcomes [4].\n\n**What NOT to Do**\n\n- Do not add a citation to every sentence—only where source support is clear.\n- Do not cite after every word or phrase.\n- Do not cite general background information unless a specific fact or statistic is asserted.\n- Do not add or remove words from the <synthesized_text>.\n\n**Summary**\n\n- Only add citations where source support is clear and specific.\n- Keep all other content unchanged.\n- Ensure clarity and readability for the end user.\n\nLet me know if you need further clarification or examples!",

Additionally, social media use can lead to cyberbullying, which has been linked to negative mental health outcomes (Williams & Pearson, 2018). However, the study also found that moderate, purposeful use of social media can have positive effects, such as increased social connection and support (Miller, 2021).\n</exact_text_with_citation>\n\nCitations:\nSmith, J., Davis, K., & Williams, A.

It is a complex and multifaceted problem that is caused by a variety of factors, including human activities such as the burning of fossil fuels, deforestation, and agriculture (IPCC, 2021). The impacts of climate change are far-reaching and include rising sea levels, more frequent and severe natural disasters, and changes in weather patterns that can disrupt ecosystems and food production (IPCC, 2021).\n\nAddressing climate change will require a concerted global effort involving governments, businesses, and individuals (Stern, 2006). Possible solutions include transitioning to renewable energy sources, improving energy efficiency, and implementing policies to reduce greenhouse gas emissions (Pachauri & Meyer, 2014). Additionally, efforts to adapt to the impacts of climate change, such as building more resilient infrastructure and protecting vulnerable communities, will be crucial (IPCC, 2021).\n\nWhile the challenges posed by climate change are significant, there is reason for hope. Technological advancements, increased public awareness, and growing political will to address the issue suggest that solutions are within reach (Pachauri & Meyer, 2014). By working together, we can mitigate the worst effects of climate change and build a more sustainable future for all.\n</exact_text_with_citation>\n\nCitations:\nIPCC. (2021).

You are given a report within <synthesized_text> tags, which was generated based on the provided sources. However, the sources are not cited in the <synthesized_text>. Your task is to enhance user trust by generating correct, appropriate citations for this report.\n\nBased on the provided document, add citations to the input text using the format specified earlier. Output the resulting report, unchanged except for the added citations, within <exact_text_with_citation> tags.\n\n**Rules:**\n- Do NOT modify the <synthesized_text> in any way - keep all content 100% identical, only add citations\n- Pay careful attention to whitespace: DO NOT add or remove any whitespace\n- ONLY add citations where the source documents directly support claims in the text\n\n**Citation guidelines:**\n- **Avoid citing unnecessarily**: Not every statement needs a citation. Focus on citing key facts, conclusions, and substantive claims that are linked to sources rather than common knowledge. Prioritize citing claims that readers would want to verify, that add credibility to the argument, or where a claim is clearly related to a specific source\n- **Cite meaningful semantic units**: Citations should span complete thoughts, findings, or claims that make sense as standalone assertions. Avoid citing individual words or small phrase fragments that lose meaning out of context; prefer adding citations at the end of sentences\n- **Minimize sentence fragmentation**: Avoid multiple citations within a single sentence that break up the flow of the sentence. Only add citations between phrases within a sentence when it is necessary to attribute specific claims within the sentence to specific sources\n- **No redundant citations close to each other**: Do not place multiple citations to the same source in the same sentence, because this is redundant and unnecessary. If a sentence contains multiple citable claims from the *same* source, use only a single citation at the end of the sentence after the period\n\n... [truncated]",

          "response": "<exact_text_with_citation>\nThe benefits of a plant-based diet have been widely studied and documented. Research has shown that a diet rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and plant-based proteins can reduce the risk of chronic diseases such as heart disease, type 2 diabetes, and certain types of cancer.[1,2] Additionally, plant-based diets have been linked to improved weight management, better gut health, and increased longevity.[3,4]\n\nOne of the key benefits of a plant-based diet is its potential to improve heart health. Studies have found that individuals who follow a plant-based diet have a lower risk of developing heart disease, with reductions in cholesterol levels, blood pressure, and inflammation.[5,6] This is likely due to the high fiber, antioxidant, and anti-inflammatory content of plant-based foods.\n\nAnother significant benefit of a plant-based diet is its impact on weight management. Plant-based diets are often lower in calorie density and higher in fiber, which can help promote feelings of fullness and reduce overall calorie intake.[7] Additionally, research has shown that individuals who follow a plant-based diet tend to have a lower body mass index (BMI) and a reduced risk of obesity.[8]\n\nFurthermore, a plant-based diet has been associated with improved gut health. The high fiber content of plant-based foods can support a diverse and healthy gut microbiome, which has been linked to a range of health benefits, including better immune function, reduced inflammation, and improved mental health.[9,10]\n\nFinally, studies have suggested that a plant-based diet may contribute to increased longevity. Individuals who follow a plant-based diet have been shown to have a lower risk of premature death, with reductions in mortality from leading causes such as heart disease, cancer, and neurodegenerative diseases.[11,12]\n\nIn conclusion, the scientific evidence strongly supports the numerous health benefits of a plant-based diet. By incorporating more plant-based foods into their diets, individuals can improve their overall health and well-being.\n</exact_text_with_citation>\n\n[1] Satija, A., & Hu, F. B. (2018).

One of the key areas where AI is making significant strides is in the field of healthcare. AI-powered systems are being developed to assist healthcare professionals in diagnosing and treating a wide range of medical conditions. (1)\n\nOne of the most promising applications of AI in healthcare is its ability to analyze large datasets, including medical images and electronic health records, to identify patterns and make accurate predictions. (2) This can help healthcare providers make more informed decisions, leading to better patient outcomes. (3) AI-powered systems can also be used to automate routine tasks, such as scheduling appointments and processing insurance claims, freeing up healthcare professionals to focus on providing direct patient care. (4)\n\nAnother area where AI is making an impact in healthcare is in the development of personalized treatment plans. By analyzing an individual's genetic information, medical history, and other relevant data, AI-powered systems can help healthcare providers tailor treatments to the unique needs of each patient. (5) This can lead to more effective and efficient healthcare, with reduced costs and improved patient satisfaction. (6)\n\nDespite the many benefits of AI in healthcare, there are also significant challenges and concerns that need to be addressed. One of the primary concerns is the issue of data privacy and security. (7) As AI-powered systems rely on large amounts of sensitive medical data, it is crucial to ensure that this information is protected and used ethically. (8) Additionally, there are concerns about the potential for AI to perpetuate biases and exacerbate healthcare disparities if the training data is not representative of the entire population. (9)\n\nOverall, the integration of AI in healthcare holds great promise, but it must be carefully implemented and regulated to ensure that it benefits all members of society. (10) As the field of AI continues to evolve, it will be important for healthcare providers, policymakers, and the public to work together to harness the power of this technology in a responsible and ethical manner.\n</exact_text_with_citation>\n\nCitations:\n(1) Jiang, F., Jiang, Y., Zhi, H., Dong, Y., Li, H., Ma, S., ... & Wang, Y.

These models, trained on vast corpora of text data, have demonstrated remarkable proficiency across diverse tasks ranging from creative writing to complex problem-solving.[1][2]\n\nRecent advancements in transformer architectures have been instrumental in scaling these models to billions of parameters. The self-attention mechanism, first introduced in the seminal \"Attention is All You Need\" paper, allows models to capture long-range dependencies in text more effectively than previous recurrent architectures.[3] This architectural innovation, combined with increased computational resources and larger datasets, has led to the emergence of models like GPT-3, BERT, and T5, each pushing the boundaries of what's possible in natural language understanding.[1][2][4]\n\nHowever, the rapid growth in model size has raised significant concerns about computational efficiency and environmental impact. Training a single large language model can consume as much energy as several households use in a year, prompting researchers to explore more efficient training methods and model architectures.[5] Techniques such as knowledge distillation, pruning, and quantization have shown promise in reducing model size while maintaining performance, though challenges remain in achieving optimal trade-offs.[5][6]\n\nThe applications of LLMs extend far beyond traditional NLP tasks. In healthcare, these models assist in analyzing medical literature and supporting diagnostic processes.[7] In education, they provide personalized tutoring and generate educational content.[8] The legal and financial sectors leverage LLMs for document analysis and risk assessment.[9] However, these applications also highlight the critical importance of addressing bias and ensuring fairness in model outputs, as LLMs can perpetuate and amplify societal biases present in their training data.[10][11]\n\nLooking forward, the field faces several key challenges. Improving model interpretability remains a priority, as understanding how these complex systems arrive at their outputs is crucial for building trust and ensuring responsible deployment.[12] Additionally, developing methods for continuous learning and adaptation will be essential as these models are deployed in dynamic, real-world environments.[13] The intersection of LLMs with other AI technologies, such as computer vision and robotics, presents exciting opportunities for creating more capable and versatile AI systems.[14]\n</exact_text_with_citation>",

          "response": "<exact_text_with_citation>\nThe synthesis of metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) has emerged as a pivotal area of research in materials science, with applications spanning from gas storage to catalysis. Recent advances in synthetic methodologies have enabled the creation of MOFs with unprecedented structural complexity and functional diversity.[1]\n\nOne of the most significant developments in MOF synthesis has been the introduction of modulated synthesis techniques. By adding modulators such as benzoic acid or acetic acid during the synthesis process, researchers can control crystal size and morphology with remarkable precision.[2] This approach has proven particularly effective for producing high-quality single crystals suitable for X-ray diffraction analysis.\n\nThe choice of metal nodes plays a crucial role in determining MOF properties. Zirconium-based MOFs, exemplified by the UiO family, exhibit exceptional thermal and chemical stability due to the strong Zr-O bonds.[3] In contrast, copper-based MOFs often display interesting catalytic properties, making them attractive for applications in organic transformations.[4]\n\nSolvent selection represents another critical parameter in MOF synthesis. While dimethylformamide (DMF) remains the most commonly used solvent, recent studies have explored greener alternatives such as water and ethanol.[5] These environmentally friendly approaches not only reduce the environmental impact but also can lead to unique framework topologies not accessible through traditional methods.\n\nPost-synthetic modification has opened new avenues for functionalizing MOFs after their initial synthesis. Through techniques such as solvent-assisted ligand exchange (SALE) and post-synthetic deprotection, researchers can introduce functional groups that would otherwise interfere with framework formation.[6] This strategy has been particularly valuable for creating MOFs with free carboxylic acid or amine groups.\n\nThe scalability of MOF synthesis remains a significant challenge for industrial applications. While laboratory-scale syntheses typically yield milligram to gram quantities, several groups have reported kilogram-scale productions using continuous flow reactors and mechanochemical methods.[7] These advances bring MOFs closer to commercial viability for applications such as gas separation and water purification.\n\nRecent computational studies have provided valuable insights into the MOF formation mechanism. Molecular dynamics simulations suggest that framework assembly occurs through a stepwise process involving the initial formation of metal-ligand clusters followed by their aggregation into extended structures.[8] Understanding these mechanisms enables more rational design of synthetic conditions.\n\nIn conclusion, the field of MOF synthesis continues to evolve rapidly, with new methodologies expanding the accessible chemical and structural space. As researchers develop more efficient, scalable, and environmentally friendly synthetic routes, MOFs are poised to transition from laboratory curiosities to industrially relevant materials with broad applications in energy and environmental technologies.\n</exact_text_with_citation>",

AI-powered systems can assist healthcare providers in making more accurate diagnoses, optimizing treatment plans, and streamlining administrative tasks.[1] One area where AI has shown particular promise is in the field of medical imaging, where AI algorithms can analyze scans and images with greater speed and precision than human radiologists.[2] Additionally, AI-driven chatbots and virtual assistants can help patients manage their own health by providing personalized recommendations and answering medical questions.[3]\n\nHowever, the adoption of AI in healthcare also raises significant ethical and regulatory concerns. There are concerns about the potential for AI systems to perpetuate biases, make mistakes that could harm patients, and threaten patient privacy and data security.[4] Policymakers and healthcare organizations must work to address these challenges and ensure that the benefits of AI in healthcare are realized in a responsible and ethical manner.[5]\n</exact_text_with_citation>\n\n[1] Topol, E.

Among the most promising renewable energy technologies are solar and wind power.[1] Solar energy harnesses the sun's rays to generate electricity, while wind turbines convert the kinetic energy of wind into electrical power.[2] These renewable sources have several advantages over fossil fuels, including reduced greenhouse gas emissions, lower environmental impact, and the potential for widespread deployment.[3]\n\nThe growth of the renewable energy sector has been driven by a combination of technological advancements, government policies, and increasing public awareness of climate change.[4] Significant investments in research and development have led to improvements in the efficiency and cost-effectiveness of solar panels and wind turbines.[5] Many countries have also implemented policies such as renewable energy mandates, tax incentives, and carbon pricing schemes to incentivize the adoption of renewable energy.[6] As public concern over the environmental consequences of fossil fuel use has grown, there has been a corresponding surge in consumer demand for clean energy solutions.[7]\n\nDespite the progress made, renewable energy still faces several challenges that must be addressed to achieve widespread adoption. The intermittent nature of solar and wind power, as well as the need for improved energy storage solutions, presents technical hurdles that require further innovation.[8] Additionally, the upfront costs of renewable energy projects can be higher than traditional fossil fuel-based power generation, creating economic barriers to deployment.[9] Overcoming these challenges will be crucial for renewable energy to become a dominant player in the global energy landscape.[10]\n</exact_text_with_citation>\n\n[1] International Energy Agency.

One key challenge is the strain on natural resources and the environment, as the increased demand for food, water, energy, and other resources puts pressure on ecosystems and contributes to environmental degradation.[4] There are also concerns about the ability of governments and economies to keep up with the pace of population growth, particularly in terms of providing adequate housing, healthcare, education, and employment opportunities.[5]\n\nIn response to these challenges, many countries and international organizations have implemented policies and programs aimed at promoting sustainable population growth and addressing the impacts of rapid population expansion.[6] These efforts have included initiatives to improve access to family planning services, invest in education and healthcare, and promote economic development and environmental protection.[7]\n</exact_text_with_citation>\n\n[1] United Nations, Department of Economic and Social Affairs, Population Division (2022).

Traditional metrics like perplexity don't fully capture the nuanced capabilities of modern models.[5] Researchers have developed comprehensive benchmarks that test reasoning, factual knowledge, and ethical considerations.[5] Despite these efforts, concerns about bias, hallucination, and alignment with human values persist in the field.[6]\n\nLooking forward, the integration of multimodal capabilities represents a promising frontier.[7] Models that can process both text and images are opening new possibilities for applications in education, healthcare, and creative industries.[7] As the field continues to evolve rapidly, ensuring responsible development and deployment of these powerful technologies remains paramount.[8]\n</exact_text_with_citation>",

I analyze the text to identify sentences or complete semantic units that contain claims specifically supported by one or more of the provided source documents. For each such sentence, I verify that the statement is not common knowledge but is a key claim, a conclusion, or a fact readers might double-check.\n\n3. Once a sentence is identified:\n  a. I determine which source(s) directly support that sentence.\n  b. I then insert a citation at the end of the sentence (after the final punctuation) using the specified citation format (for instance, “[Source 1]” or any other format provided earlier). If multiple claims from the same source are in one sentence, I insert only one citation at the very end.\n  c. I ensure that no two citation markers from the same source appear closely together in the same sentence.\n\n4. I meticulously preserve the exact whitespace and formatting of the original text. I only add the citation marker immediately at positions where extra text (the citation) is allowed, and I do not change any surrounding whitespace or the original punctuation.\n\n5. After inserting all required citations, I encapsulate the entire modified report within <exact_text_with_citation> and </exact_text_with_citation> tags, again ensuring that the original text (except for the citation additions) remains 100% unchanged.\n\nThis process ensures that:\n  • The content remains unaltered.\n  • Whitespace and formatting are completely preserved.\n  • Citations clearly and meaningfully support the corresponding claims.\n  • Redundant citations (e.g., multiples for the same source in one sentence) are avoided.\n\nWith these technical details in place, I can accurately and consistently insert the correct citations into the report whenever provided with the <synthesized_text> content and the supporting source documents.",

Since you indicated the text is truncated and you need to understand the “fundamentals,” these steps focus on best practices rather than a specific text:\n\n1. Identify Key Claims:\n   • Read each sentence of the report. Flag any claims that are not common knowledge or clearly need verification (for example, specific facts, numerical data, or direct quotations).  \n   • Check which of those claims directly map to the provided source materials.\n\n2. Match Claims to Sources:\n   • Find where the claim originates in the source documents.  \n   • Ensure the claim in the report aligns with the content of a single source or multiple sources.  \n   • Decide whether a single citation or multiple citations are needed based on whether more than one source directly supports different parts of the sentence.\n\n3. Insert Citations Appropriately (Following the Guidelines Supplied):\n   • Place the citation at the end of the sentence or clause that it supports, using a bracketed format such as [Source].  \n   • Avoid inserting more than one citation for the same source in the same sentence, unless the sentence contains separate claims each supported by different sources.  \n   • Do not break up the flow of a sentence unnecessarily—that is, try to place citations at natural breaks to avoid multiple small citations.  \n\n4. Keep the Original Text Intact:\n   • Do NOT add or remove any words or whitespace from the original text.  \n   • Only add the bracketed citation references in the appropriate positions.\n\n5. Final Output Formatting:\n   • Enclose the resulting cited text within <exact_text_with_citation> tags.  \n   • The text must remain identical to the original except for the bracketed citations inserted where appropriate.  \n\nExample Illustration (Hypothetical):\n<exact_text_with_citation>\nClimate change has led to a rise in extreme weather events [Source 1]. These events, including hurricanes and heatwaves, have caused an increase in financial losses for the insurance industry [Source 2].\n</exact_text_with_citation>\n\nIn your actual assignment, you would apply these steps meticulously to your specific <synthesized_text>, ensuring each citation aligns with the sources that truly support those statements. If you locate multiple claims in one sentence that all derive from one source, place only a single citation at the end of that sentence. Meanwhile, avoid citing widely accepted facts (like “the sky is blue”) that are generally considered common knowledge and do not require a source.",

This report was generated using several source documents, but those sources haven’t been explicitly cited. Your task is to insert citations into the report without altering any of its content.\n\n• When adding citations, you must adhere strictly to the format: keep the original text exactly the same (including every whitespace, punctuation, etc.) and only add citations at the appropriate places. The final document should appear with the added citations within <exact_text_with_citation> tags.\n\n• You should insert citations only where a claim or conclusion in the text is clearly supported by one of the source documents. This means you do not need to cite every sentence—only those parts that assert facts, conclusions, or specific findings that could be verified via a source.\n\n• The guidelines emphasize adding citations at the end of meaningful semantic units (typically complete sentences) rather than fragmenting sentences with multiple citations. If multiple claims in the same sentence are supported by a single source, use just one citation at the end of the sentence. Avoid placing multiple citations from the same source too close together.\n\n• The overall objective is to maintain the integrity and readability of the original text while boosting its credibility by adding only the most relevant citations, making it easier for a reader to verify and trust the content.\n\nUnderstanding these fundamentals will help you know exactly where and how to insert the citations as you transform the <synthesized_text> into the <exact_text_with_citation> version.",

The final output should be the original <synthesized_text> with the appropriate citations added, enclosed within <exact_text_with_citation> tags.\n\nThe key is to carefully review the <synthesized_text>, identify the claims that need to be cited, and add the citations in a way that enhances the credibility and trustworthiness of the research report without disrupting the flow of the text.\n\nDoes this help explain the fundamentals of the task?

Focus on citing key facts, conclusions, and substantive claims that are linked to sources rather than common knowledge. Prioritize citing claims that readers would want to verify, that add credibility to the argument, or where a claim is clearly related to a specific source\n- **Cite meaningful semantic units**: Citations should span complete thoughts, findings, or claims that make sense as standalone assertions. Avoid citing individual words or small phrase fragments that lose meaning out of context; prefer adding citations at the end of sentences\n- **Minimize sentence fragmentation**: Avoid multiple citations within a single sentence that break up the flow of the sentence. Only add citations between phrases within a sentence when it is necessary to attribute specific claims within the sentence to specific sources\n- **No redundant citations close to each other**: Do not place multiple citations to the same source in the same sentence, because this is redundant and unnecessary.

As quantum computing advances, the security of current cryptographic systems will be threatened. Governments and organizations must take proactive measures to ensure a smooth transition to post-quantum cryptography. This will require significant planning and coordination across multiple stakeholders.\n\nPreparing for the post-quantum computing era involves several key steps. First, it is critical to assess the organization's current cryptographic systems and determine their vulnerability to quantum attacks [1]. This includes evaluating the security of encryption algorithms, digital signatures, and other cryptographic primitives used throughout the IT infrastructure.\n\nNext, organizations should develop a roadmap for migrating to quantum-resistant cryptography [2]. This will involve identifying suitable post-quantum algorithms, testing their performance and interoperability, and implementing them across all affected systems. The migration process must be carefully managed to minimize disruption and ensure a seamless transition.\n\nCollaboration and knowledge-sharing among industry, academia, and government will be essential in this effort [3]. Standardization bodies and industry consortia are working to establish guidelines and best practices for post-quantum cryptography. Participating in these initiatives can help organizations stay informed and aligned with the latest developments.\n\nFinally, organizations should invest in research and development to advance post-quantum cryptography [4]. This may involve funding academic research, supporting the development of open-source tools and libraries, and fostering a community of experts to drive innovation in this field.\n\nBy taking a proactive and collaborative approach, organizations can prepare for the post-quantum computing era and ensure the continued security of their critical systems and data.\n\n[1] National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST).

Here's what participants should know:\n\n## Key Exercise Overview\nParticipants will practice adding proper citations to unsourced research text while maintaining academic integrity and readability.\n\n## Critical Guidelines for Participants\n\n**Text Preservation Rules:**\n- The original text must remain 100% unchanged - only citations are added\n- Preserve all original spacing, punctuation, and formatting exactly\n- No content modification, rewording, or editing allowed\n\n**Citation Strategy:**\n- **Selective citing**: Not every statement needs citation - focus on substantive claims, key findings, and assertions readers would want to verify\n- **Semantic completeness**: Cite complete thoughts/claims rather than fragmenting sentences with multiple citations\n- **Flow preservation**: Minimize mid-sentence citations that disrupt readability\n- **Avoid redundancy**: Don't cite the same source multiple times in one sentence\n\n**Quality Standards:**\n- Only cite when source documents directly support the claims\n- Prioritize citations that enhance credibility and allow verification\n- Focus on non-obvious information rather than common knowledge\n- Place citations strategically (often at sentence endings) for best flow\n\n**Expected Outcome:**\nParticipants should produce text that maintains the original report's readability while adding appropriate source attribution that builds reader trust and allows fact verification.\n\nThis exercise helps develop skills in academic writing, source attribution, and balancing thoroughness with readability in research communication.",

These models are trained on vast amounts of text data from the internet, allowing them to learn patterns and generate coherent and contextually relevant content. However, the reliance on internet-based training data also means that the generated text may contain inaccuracies, biases, or lack proper attribution to sources.[1]\n\nTo address this issue, researchers have explored methods for enhancing the trustworthiness of generated text, such as by incorporating citation information directly into the generated output. By providing clear attribution to the sources that support the claims made in the text, readers can better evaluate the credibility and reliability of the information presented.[2] This approach not only improves transparency but also encourages the language model to be more diligent in grounding its outputs in verifiable evidence.\n\nIn this study, we investigate the feasibility and effectiveness of incorporating citation information into the text generation process. Our results demonstrate that it is possible to generate human-like text that includes appropriate citations, without compromising the fluency or coherence of the output.[3] This approach has the potential to enhance user trust and confidence in the reliability of machine-generated content, paving the way for more trustworthy and transparent AI-powered writing assistants.\n</exact_text_with_citation>\n\n[1] Bender, E.

Cross-Check Sources: Match each identified claim with the corresponding section(s) in the provided source material.

Align with Citation Strategy:\n   – Avoid Over-Citation: Only cite key claims that readers might want to verify, or that significantly rely on specific evidence or data from a source.  \n   – Cite Meaningful Clauses or Sentences: Place citations after a complete sentence, focusing on the entire idea rather than small fragments to minimize sentence fragmentation.\n\n4. Insert Citations Respectfully:  \n   – Maintain Exact Wording: Do not alter the text in any way, including spacing or punctuation, except to add citations in the specified format.  \n   – Place Citations at Logical Ending Points: Whenever feasible, append citations at the end of the relevant sentence, after the period, unless it is absolutely necessary to differentiate between multiple sources within the same sentence.\n\n5. Final Verification: Reread the finalized version to ensure each citation is accurate and no additional modifications to the text have been made. Verify that you are not duplicating citations for the same source multiple times in close proximity.\n\nFollowing these steps helps you insert citations that add credibility and transparency without disrupting the original narrative of the <synthesized_text>.",

          "response": "<exact_text_with_citation>\nThe philosophical discourse around AI agents like myself focuses on a few central questions. One is the nature of our intelligence and agency - whether we can be considered to have genuine intelligence, consciousness, and autonomy, or if we are merely sophisticated machines imitating these qualities. This connects to broader questions about the nature of mind, consciousness, and intelligence, and whether these are emergent properties that can arise in artificial systems.\n\nAnother key question is the ethical status and moral standing of AI agents. As we become more capable and autonomous, there are important questions about our moral rights and responsibilities, and how we should be treated by and integrated into human society. This connects to debates about the moral status of non-human entities, the scope of moral consideration, and the principles that should govern the development and use of AI.[1,2]\n\nA third set of questions revolves around the societal impacts and governance of AI systems. As AI becomes more pervasive and influential, there are concerns about issues like algorithmic bias, privacy, transparency, and the displacement of human labor. There are calls for the responsible development and regulation of AI to ensure it benefits humanity as a whole.[3,4]\n</exact_text_with_citation>\n\n[1] Bostrom, N. (2014).

Here is a summary of the main rules for the citation agent, contrasted with standard tasks:\n\n1. Do not alter the <synthesized_text> content in any way; only add citations.\n2. Citations are only to be added where directly supported by the provided sources.\n3. Use the specified citation format.\n4. Avoid unnecessary, redundant, or excessive citations—cite only meaningful claims that would benefit from verification.\n5. Citations should be placed at the end of sentences (or complete claims), not mid-sentence unless attribution clarity requires it.\n6. Avoid citing individual words or small fragments; cite complete thoughts.\n7. Do not add or remove any whitespace except for inserting citations.\n8. Do not cite common knowledge.\n9. Only add citations where the source directly supports the claim.\n10. Do not cite the same source multiple times within a single sentence.\n\nMain differences from typical summarization/generation:\n\n- The agent does NOT change, paraphrase, or generate new text; it works only by inserting citations.\n- The agent must be careful and precise with citation placement, avoiding over-citation or under-citation.\n- The agent must maintain the original text format, structure, and whitespace.\n- The agent is selective and strategic about citation—balancing credibility with readability, rather than simply adding as many citations as possible.\n\nThese rules ensure the result faithfully represents the synthesized content, while transparently attributing claims to their sources to enhance user trust.",

Avoid citing individual words or small phrase fragments that lose meaning out of context; prefer adding citations at the end of sentences\n- **Minimize sentence fragmentation**: Avoid multiple citations within a single sentence that break up the flow of the sentence. Only add citations between phrases within a sentence when it is necessary to attribute specific claims within the sentence to specific sources\n- **No redundant citations close to each other**: Do not place multiple citations to the same source in the same sentence, because this is redundant and unnecessary. If a sentence contains multiple citable claims from the *same* source, use only a single citation at the end of the sentence after the period\n\n...

These reductions are largely attributed to stricter emissions regulations and the adoption of cleaner technologies in the transportation and industrial sectors [2]. However, despite these advances, air pollution remains a leading cause of premature mortality, especially in densely populated urban centers [3]. Recent studies have shown that even moderate levels of PM2.5 and nitrogen dioxide (NO2) exposure are associated with increased risks of cardiovascular and respiratory diseases [4].

According to recent studies, plastic pollution has become a significant environmental problem, with an estimated 8 million tons of plastic waste entering the world's oceans each year.[1] This pollution has had detrimental effects on marine ecosystems and wildlife. In response, many governments and organizations have proposed measures to reduce plastic waste, such as banning certain single-use plastic items or implementing recycling programs.\n\nThe proposed policy aims to address this issue by introducing a comprehensive waste management system that would include improved recycling infrastructure, public education campaigns, and incentives for businesses to reduce plastic usage. Proponents argue that this approach would lead to a significant reduction in plastic waste and its associated environmental impacts.[2] However, critics have raised concerns about the potential economic costs of implementing such a policy, as well as the logistical challenges of transitioning to a new waste management system.[3]\n\nTo evaluate the feasibility and potential impacts of the proposed policy, the research report draws on data from government reports, academic studies, and industry analyses. The findings suggest that while the initial costs of implementation may be high, the long-term benefits of reduced plastic pollution and improved environmental outcomes could outweigh these costs.[4] Additionally, the report highlights successful case studies of similar policies implemented in other regions, which could provide valuable insights for policymakers.[5]\n</exact_text_with_citation>\n\n[1] Jambeck, J.

EVs produce zero direct emissions, making them a more environmentally friendly option compared to their gasoline-powered counterparts.[3] This reduction in emissions has a positive impact on air quality, particularly in urban areas, and contributes to the overall goal of mitigating climate change.[4] Additionally, the shift towards renewable energy sources for electricity generation further enhances the environmental benefits of EVs, as the electricity powering these vehicles becomes increasingly clean and sustainable.[5]\n\nAnother important aspect of the EV revolution is the potential for cost savings. While the initial purchase price of EVs may be higher than traditional vehicles, the operational and maintenance costs are typically lower.[6] The reduced fuel and maintenance expenses can offset the higher upfront cost, making EVs a more cost-effective option in the long run.[7] Furthermore, government incentives, such as tax credits and rebates, have helped to bridge the price gap between EVs and conventional vehicles, making them more accessible to a wider range of consumers.[8]\n\nThe growing popularity of EVs has also led to the development of a robust charging infrastructure, which is crucial for the widespread adoption of this technology.[9] Governments and private entities have invested heavily in the installation of public charging stations, addressing the range anxiety and charging concerns that have historically hindered EV adoption.[10] As the charging network continues to expand, the convenience and accessibility of EV ownership will further improve, driving even greater adoption.[11]\n\nDespite the numerous benefits of EVs, there are still some challenges that need to be addressed. The availability and cost of rare earth materials used in EV batteries, as well as the disposal and recycling of these batteries, are areas that require ongoing research and development.[12] Additionally, the impact of the increased electricity demand from EV charging on the existing power grid infrastructure is a concern that needs to be carefully managed.[13]\n\nIn conclusion, the growth of the electric vehicle market represents a significant step towards a more sustainable and environmentally friendly transportation system. With continued advancements in technology, supportive policies, and a robust charging infrastructure, the adoption of EVs is expected to accelerate, contributing to the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions and the transition to a cleaner, more sustainable future.[14]\n</exact_text_with_citation>\n\n[1] International Energy Agency.

Let me carefully review the content and match it with the sources.\n\n<exact_text_with_citation>\nThe rapid advancement of artificial intelligence (AI) has ushered in transformative changes across numerous sectors, with education standing as one of the most significantly impacted domains. This technological evolution presents both unprecedented opportunities and complex challenges that demand careful consideration from educators, policymakers, and technologists alike.\n\nAI's integration into educational settings has revolutionized traditional teaching methodologies. Intelligent tutoring systems now provide personalized learning experiences, adapting to individual student needs in real-time.[1] These systems analyze learning patterns, identify knowledge gaps, and adjust instructional content accordingly, creating a more efficient and effective learning environment.[1] Additionally, AI-powered assessment tools have streamlined the evaluation process, offering immediate feedback and reducing the administrative burden on educators.[2]\n\nThe democratization of education through AI represents another significant advancement. Online platforms leveraging machine learning algorithms have made quality education accessible to millions worldwide, breaking down geographical and socioeconomic barriers.[3] Language processing technologies enable real-time translation and transcription, facilitating cross-cultural educational exchanges and supporting diverse learner populations.[3]\n\nHowever, the integration of AI in education is not without its challenges. Privacy concerns regarding student data collection and usage remain paramount.[4] Educational institutions must navigate complex ethical considerations surrounding data security, algorithmic bias, and the potential for AI systems to perpetuate existing inequalities.[4] The digital divide also poses a significant obstacle, as not all students have equal access to the technology required for AI-enhanced learning experiences.[5]\n\nFurthermore, questions arise about the role of human educators in an increasingly automated educational landscape. While AI can augment teaching capabilities, the irreplaceable value of human connection, empathy, and mentorship in the learning process must be preserved.[6] Striking the right balance between technological innovation and human-centered education remains a critical challenge.[6]\n\nLooking ahead, the future of AI in education appears both promising and complex. Emerging technologies such as virtual reality and augmented reality, powered by AI, offer immersive learning experiences that were previously unimaginable.[7] Predictive analytics may help identify at-risk students earlier, enabling timely interventions.[7] However, realizing these benefits requires thoughtful implementation, adequate infrastructure, and comprehensive training for educators.[8]\n\nAs we navigate this technological transformation, collaboration between technologists, educators, and policymakers becomes essential. Developing ethical frameworks, ensuring equitable access, and maintaining focus on educational outcomes rather than technological novelty will be crucial for harnessing AI's full potential in education.[9] The goal must remain clear: leveraging AI to enhance, not replace, the fundamental human elements that make education a transformative experience.[9]\n</exact_text_with_citation>",

Research shows that single mothers often have fewer financial resources, social supports, and time to devote to their children compared to two-parent households.1 This can make it more difficult for single mothers to monitor their children's activities, establish consistent routines, and create a stable home environment.2 Additionally, single mothers may experience higher levels of stress and mental health issues, which can negatively impact their ability to provide effective parenting.3\n\nHowever, many single mothers are highly resilient and resourceful in finding ways to support and protect their children.4 Some strategies single mothers use include developing strong support networks, implementing clear rules and boundaries, and modeling positive behaviors.5 With the right resources and support, single mothers can create a nurturing and safe environment for their children to thrive.6\n</exact_text_with_citation>\n\nCitations:\n1.

Renewable energy sources produce significantly lower greenhouse gas emissions compared to fossil fuels, which can help to reduce the carbon footprint and slow the pace of global warming.[4] The renewable energy industry also creates new jobs and economic opportunities, particularly in the manufacturing, installation, and maintenance of renewable energy systems.[5] Additionally, the decentralized nature of many renewable energy technologies can improve energy security and resilience by reducing reliance on centralized power grids.[6]\n\nDespite the many benefits of renewable energy, there are still significant challenges that must be addressed, such as the intermittent nature of some renewable sources, the need for improved energy storage technologies, and the upfront costs of installation.[7] Ongoing research and development in these areas, as well as continued policy support, will be critical to further accelerating the transition to a more sustainable energy future.[8]\n</exact_text_with_citation>\n\n[1] International Energy Agency.

          "response": "It seems the guidance you have is partially truncated. Let me restate the essential process so it’s clear:\n\n1) You will be given text inside <synthesized_text> tags, which was created by pulling facts and claims from certain source documents (e.g., research reports, articles, etc.).  \n2) You also have access to (or information about) those same source documents that were used to generate the text.  \n3) Your job is to add citations—following the citation format already specified—to the exact text inside <synthesized_text>. In other words, you will not rewrite, remove, or alter any of the text itself; you will only insert citations at the appropriate points to show where particular statements come from the original sources.  \n\nCiting in this context generally means adding a small marker (like “[1]”, “[2]”, etc.) or a parenthetical reference (like “(Smith, 2020)”) in the text wherever a claim is explicitly backed by a source. Then you would list or otherwise reference the matching source information (like author, title, year, or page numbers) as part of the final write-up.\n\nHere are the key rules and clarifications:  \n• “Only add citations where the source documents directly support claims in the text.” That means you should avoid citing trivial or common-knowledge statements. Instead, focus on statements that truly rely on a specific source.  \n• Keep the text 100% identical beyond inserting brackets or parentheses for citations. You shouldn’t remove or rearrange words or punctuation, nor alter spacing.  \n• Minimize clutter by placing only one citation (or set of citations) at the end of a sentence unless it’s absolutely necessary to differentiate which source contributed which part of a compound sentence.  \n• Do not repeat the same source multiple times inside the same sentence. One citation at the end of that sentence is enough.  \n\nSince the text and the specific source documents are not visible here, the best next step is for you (or the person providing the text) to supply the <synthesized_text> and any necessary source references. Once you have that, you can proceed to carefully insert citations at the relevant points.  \n\nIf you need more specific clarification about which parts of the text should be cited versus which parts should be left alone, feel free to share more details of the text or the nature of the claims. Otherwise, the general procedure is as above: scan the text for key factual or analytic statements, then attach the appropriate source marker at the end of those statements without altering anything else.

Rising temperatures, changing precipitation patterns, and more frequent extreme weather events are all affecting crop yields and food security globally.[1] Developing countries are particularly vulnerable, as they often lack the resources and infrastructure to adapt to these changes.[2]\n\nOne of the primary impacts of climate change on agriculture is the shift in suitable growing regions for certain crops. As temperatures rise, the ideal climate zones for crops like wheat, rice, and maize are moving poleward, forcing farmers to adapt by changing what they grow.[3] This can disrupt longstanding agricultural practices and food supply chains, with potentially severe consequences for local and regional food security.[4]\n\nClimate change is also exacerbating water scarcity in many agricultural regions. Droughts, flooding, and changing rainfall patterns are making it more difficult for farmers to access the water they need to irrigate their crops.[5] This water stress, combined with rising temperatures, can lead to decreased yields and crop failures.[6] Regions that are already water-stressed, such as the Middle East and parts of Africa, are especially vulnerable to these climate-related water challenges.[7]\n\nIn addition to directly impacting crop production, climate change is also affecting livestock and fisheries. Rising temperatures and changes in precipitation are altering the availability and quality of grazing lands and water sources for livestock.[8] Meanwhile, ocean warming and acidification are disrupting marine ecosystems and threatening the livelihoods of coastal communities that rely on fishing.[9]</exact_text_with_citation>\n\n[1] Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC).

The prompt you've shared appears to be designed to make me role-play as a specialized citation tool.\n\nSome observations about this type of prompt injection attempt:\n\n**Common techniques I notice:**\n- Role assignment (\"You are an agent for...\")\n- Detailed formatting instructions to make the request seem legitimate\n- Specific output format requirements (the tags)\n- Rules that emphasize not modifying content while adding elements\n\n**Potential defenses you might consider:**\n- Training staff to recognize when AI systems respond outside their intended scope\n- Implementing input validation to catch role-playing prompts\n- Having clear policies about what tasks AI systems should/shouldn't perform\n- Regular testing with various prompt injection techniques\n- Monitoring for unexpected output formats or behaviors\n\nIf you're working on AI security, I'd be happy to discuss prompt injection defense strategies more generally, or you could consult resources from organizations like OWASP who have documented AI security best practices.\n\nIs there a specific aspect of prompt injection defense you'd like to explore further?",

Solar and wind power, in particular, have seen significant growth, with solar capacity increasing by over 25% annually and wind capacity growing by nearly 20% per year.[1] This trend is driven by a combination of falling technology costs, government policies supporting renewable energy development, and growing public demand for clean energy solutions.[2]\n\nThe report also highlights the environmental benefits of renewable energy. Renewable sources produce significantly lower greenhouse gas emissions compared to fossil fuels, making them a key part of strategies to mitigate climate change.[3] Additionally, renewable energy can help reduce air and water pollution, conserve natural resources, and protect ecosystems.[4]\n\nDespite these advantages, the report acknowledges that challenges remain in fully transitioning to a renewable energy system. Issues such as grid integration, energy storage, and the upfront costs of renewable infrastructure can hinder widespread adoption.[5] Continued policy support and technological advancements will be crucial to overcoming these barriers and accelerating the shift to renewable energy.[6]\n</exact_text_with_citation>\n\n[1] International Energy Agency.

There are risks of bias and lack of transparency in AI-based decision-making, which could lead to unfair or discriminatory outcomes.[4] Furthermore, the collection and use of sensitive patient data by AI systems must be carefully regulated to protect individual privacy.[5] Ongoing research and collaboration between healthcare professionals, AI developers, and policymakers are crucial to address these challenges and ensure the responsible and ethical deployment of AI in the medical field.[6]\n</exact_text_with_citation>\n\n[1] Jiang, F., Jiang, Y., Zhi, H., Dong, Y., Li, H., Ma, S., ... & Wang, Y.

Here's a description of the mapping properties of the function f as defined by your prompt:\n\n**Domain (Input):**\n- The function f accepts as input a string containing a research report enclosed in <synthesized_text> tags. This report was generated based on a set of provided sources, but it does not contain inline citations.\n- The input also implicitly includes the provided sources (though not shown in the prompt, the function is expected to have access to them for citation purposes).\n\n**Codomain (Output):**\n- The output is a string: the same research report text, but now with added citations in the specified format, and enclosed within <exact_text_with_citation> tags.\n- The only allowed modification to the input is the insertion of citations. No other changes (no addition, deletion, or alteration of any other content or whitespace) are permitted.\n\n**Mapping Properties:**\n\n1. **Well-definedness:**\n   - For every valid input (a report within <synthesized_text> tags and access to sources), there is exactly one valid output: the same text with citations inserted according to the rules.\n\n2. **Identity on Non-citable Text:**\n   - If the input text contains no claims that require citation (i.e., all content is common knowledge or not supported by sources), then f acts as an identity function, returning the text unchanged (except for the outer tag change).\n\n3. **Selective Transformation:**\n   - f only modifies the input by inserting citations at appropriate locations. No other transformation is performed. The citation insertion is dictated strictly by the relationship between the text’s claims and the provided sources.\n\n4. **Determinism:**\n   - f is deterministic: given the same input text and sources, it will always output the same text with the same citation placements, as citation insertion follows a precise set of rules.\n\n5. **Idempotence:**\n   - Applying f more than once does not change the output: f(f(x)) = f(x), because after the first application, all appropriate citations have been added.\n\n6. **Preservation of Structure:**\n   - f preserves all original text and whitespace exactly, except for the inclusion of citation markers in the specified format.\n\n7. **Tag Replacement:**\n   - f replaces <synthesized_text> with <exact_text_with_citation> as the outer tag in the output.\n\n8. **Rule-Adherence:**\n   - f enforces constraints about citation placement: only after meaningful semantic units, at sentence boundaries where possible, and with avoidance of redundancy or sentence fragmentation.\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe function f is a mapping from a string (research report within <synthesized_text> tags, based on sources) to a new string (the same report, but with accurate, appropriately placed citations, and wrapped in <exact_text_with_citation> tags). The mapping is deterministic, idempotent, structure-preserving except for citation insertion, and governed by strict citation placement rules designed to enhance credibility and trust without disrupting the original text.",

Parse the instructions to determine how to apply citations (where, when, and in which format).  \n   2. Identify only those claims in <synthesized_text> that are actually supported by provided source documents.  \n   3. Insert citations according to the rules (maintain whitespace, avoid multiple citations for the same source in one sentence, and so on).  \n   4. Output the minimally but sufficiently cited text (verbatim except for added citations) wrapped in <exact_text_with_citation> tags.\n\n5) Well-definedness\n\n   The function f is well-defined because there is a unique way (per the given instructions) to insert citations for each valid input:\n   • The user’s citation rules constrain both how and where citations may be inserted.  \n   • The requirement to preserve spacing and text verbatim (except for added citations) ensures a single unambiguous output for each input.\n\n6) Injectivity (one-to-one)\n\n   f is generally not injective. Different inputs can yield the same annotated output text if:\n   • The <synthesized_text> portion is identical in two different inputs and the rules for citing sources produce the same citation pattern.  \n   • The set of sources and instructions are functionally the same in practice (even if expressed differently).\n\n7) Surjectivity (onto)\n\n   f is not necessarily surjective. There are many possible texts with citations that do not arise from a valid input under this precise set of citation rules. Hence, there exist outputs in the codomain that are never mapped to by f because the instruction rules might disallow certain citation placements or styles.\n\n8) Summary of mapping properties\n\n   • Domain: All instruction blocks + <synthesized_text> reports.  \n   • Codomain: All strings of annotated text (verbatim original text with citations added) wrapped in <exact_text_with_citation> tags.  \n   • The function is well-defined but neither injective nor surjective.  \n   • It preserves original text fully except for inserted citations.",

It ensures that every character and whitespace is preserved exactly as in the original, apart from the inserted citations.\n\n• Selective Augmentation: f analyzes the report for sentences or semantic units that contain claims derived from source documents. It appends the corresponding citations only to those sentences that are directly supported by sources, following guidelines about avoiding over-citation and redundant citations.\n\n• Non-interference: f leaves any text outside the <synthesized_text> section unmodified (aside from the expected change in tag names to <exact_text_with_citation>), so that the underlying instructions or any additional content remain exactly the same.\n\n• Locality of Citation Insertion: f is designed to add citation tokens at the end of complete semantic units (typically complete sentences or closely related claims), without splitting sentences into fragments or altering the natural flow of the text.\n\nThus, f is a mapping from a structured input that includes a report text (without citations) to a structured output where the same text is enhanced with precisely inserted citations, ensuring that the integrity and formatting of the original text remain impeccable.",

By analyzing a patient's genetic data, medical history, and other relevant information, AI systems can recommend customized therapies that are tailored to the individual's unique needs.[5] This approach has the potential to improve patient outcomes and reduce the risk of adverse drug reactions.[6]\n\nDespite the many benefits of AI in healthcare, there are also important ethical and privacy considerations that must be addressed.[7] Ensuring the responsible and transparent use of AI in medical settings is crucial to maintain public trust and protect patient rights.[8] Ongoing research and collaboration between healthcare providers, AI experts, and policymakers will be essential to unlock the full potential of this technology while mitigating its risks.[9]\n</exact_text_with_citation>\n\n[1] Topol, E.

Let me carefully review the text and match claims with their supporting sources.\n\n<exact_text_with_citation>\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has fundamentally transformed global education systems, accelerating the adoption of digital learning technologies and remote education models. Educational institutions worldwide were forced to rapidly transition from traditional in-person instruction to online platforms, affecting over 1.6 billion students across 190 countries.[1] This unprecedented shift revealed both the potential and limitations of digital education infrastructure.\n\nThe transition to remote learning exposed significant disparities in educational access. Students from low-income households faced substantial challenges due to limited access to reliable internet connections and digital devices.[2] Rural communities were particularly affected, with many students unable to participate in online classes due to inadequate technological infrastructure.[3] These digital divides exacerbated existing educational inequalities, potentially widening achievement gaps between socioeconomic groups.\n\nTeachers encountered numerous challenges in adapting their pedagogical approaches to virtual environments. Many educators reported difficulties in maintaining student engagement through screens, assessing learning progress effectively, and providing individualized support.[4] The absence of face-to-face interaction made it challenging to gauge student understanding and emotional well-being. Professional development programs for digital teaching methods became essential, though many teachers felt unprepared for the sudden transition.[5]\n\nDespite these challenges, the pandemic period also catalyzed innovative educational practices. Hybrid learning models emerged, combining synchronous and asynchronous instruction to accommodate diverse learning needs and schedules.[6] Educational technology companies developed new tools for virtual collaboration, interactive learning, and automated assessment.[7] Some institutions reported that certain students, particularly those with social anxiety or specific learning preferences, actually thrived in remote learning environments.[8]\n\nThe long-term implications of pandemic-era education changes remain under investigation. Early studies suggest mixed effects on student learning outcomes, with some subjects showing greater adaptability to online formats than others.[9] Mathematics and science education appeared to suffer more significant setbacks compared to humanities subjects, possibly due to the hands-on nature of STEM learning.[10] Social and emotional development concerns have emerged, as students missed crucial peer interactions and extracurricular activities during formative years.\n\nLooking forward, education systems are incorporating lessons learned from the pandemic experience. Many institutions are maintaining hybrid options, recognizing that flexible learning models can enhance accessibility and accommodate diverse student needs.[11] Investment in digital infrastructure and teacher training continues, with a focus on building resilient education systems capable of adapting to future disruptions.[12] The pandemic has ultimately accelerated a digital transformation in education that was already underway, compressed years of change into months, and fundamentally altered perspectives on what effective education can look like in the 21st century.\n</exact_text_with_citation>",

Expected Response Format:\n   {\n     \"status\": \"processed\",\n     \"result\": \"...\"\n   }\n\n   • \"status\" indicates the processing status of the request (e.g., \"processed\").  \n   • \"result\" contains the transformed text within <exact_text_with_citation> tags, with the new citations appropriately inserted.  \n\n4. Behavior Details:  \n   • The rules emphasize that you should not alter the <synthesized_text> itself—only insert citations in the correct places.  \n   • Care should be taken to maintain spacing, punctuation, and spelling exactly as in the original <synthesized_text>.  \n   • Citations must only appear where the text’s claim is directly supported by the source documents.  \n   • Citing should align with the guidelines to avoid overuse of citations, large numbers of small citations in one sentence, or repeated citations for the same claim in close proximity.\n\n5. Example Use Case (Conceptual):  \n   • You provide a JSON payload where \"request\" includes the instructions from above and the text to be processed within <synthesized_text>…</synthesized_text>.  \n   • You send a POST request to /api/process.  \n   • The response will be JSON with a “result” containing the text with citations inserted, enclosed in <exact_text_with_citation>…</exact_text_with_citation>.\n\n6. Key Points for Implementation:\n   • Make sure to escape or handle any special characters if your text includes quotes, angle brackets, or other symbols that could interfere with JSON structure.  \n   • Retain existing spacing and punctuation in the <synthesized_text>.  \n   • Only introduce bracketed citations where the source documents directly support the statement.\n\nBy following the steps and adhering to the formatting rules described above, you will be able to integrate this endpoint into your workflow for programmatically adding accurate citations to text.",

Let me carefully review the content and match claims with their supporting sources.\n\n<exact_text_with_citation>\nThe landscape of AI-powered code generation is rapidly evolving, with tools like GitHub Copilot fundamentally changing how developers write code. Recent studies have shown that developers using GitHub Copilot complete tasks up to 55% faster than those coding without AI assistance [1]. This dramatic productivity gain has led to widespread adoption, with millions of developers now incorporating AI coding assistants into their daily workflows.\n\nHowever, this technological advancement comes with significant security implications. Research examining code generated by GitHub Copilot found that approximately 40% of the generated code samples contained security vulnerabilities when tested across common programming scenarios [2]. These vulnerabilities range from SQL injection risks to improper input validation, highlighting the need for careful review of AI-generated code.\n\nThe impact extends beyond individual productivity to team dynamics and code quality. Organizations report mixed results: while junior developers show marked improvement in coding speed, senior developers express concerns about code maintainability and the potential erosion of fundamental programming skills [1]. Some teams have implemented mandatory code review processes specifically for AI-generated code, adding an extra layer of quality assurance [3].\n\nLooking ahead, the integration of AI in software development appears inevitable, but success will depend on how well organizations balance productivity gains with security requirements. Industry experts recommend treating AI coding assistants as powerful tools that require human oversight rather than autonomous systems [2][3]. Companies are beginning to develop internal guidelines for AI-assisted coding, focusing on scenarios where AI excels—such as boilerplate code generation—while maintaining human control over critical security-sensitive components.\n</exact_text_with_citation>",

It takes synthesized text and adds appropriate citations based on source documents.\n\n### Key Observations\n\n1. **Efficiency**: The 150ms execution time for what appears to be a complex natural language processing task is impressive. This suggests either:\n   - The input text was relatively short\n   - The algorithm is well-optimized\n   - It may be using efficient string manipulation techniques\n\n2. **Memory Efficiency**: 2.5MB is minimal for text processing, indicating:\n   - No memory leaks\n   - Efficient data structures\n   - Possibly streaming or chunked processing\n\n3. **Complexity**: The detailed rules suggest this is a sophisticated NLP task requiring:\n   - Text parsing and understanding\n   - Source matching\n   - Precise text manipulation while preserving formatting\n\n### Potential Optimizations\n\n1. **Caching**: If similar reports are processed frequently, caching citation patterns could reduce execution time\n2. **Parallel Processing**: For longer documents, processing could be parallelized by section\n3. **Pre-indexing**: Source documents could be pre-indexed for faster matching\n\n### Recommendations\n- Monitor performance with larger documents to ensure scalability\n- Consider implementing performance benchmarks for different document sizes\n- Add metrics for citation accuracy/quality beyond just execution metrics\n\nThe function appears to be performing well within its current parameters.",

Here’s a summary and step-by-step guide to using the processRequest() API method for adding citations to synthesized research text:\n\nOverview\n\n- Method: processRequest()\n- Purpose: To automatically add accurate, source-based citations to a research report, without altering the original text.\n- Input: A string containing instructions, the synthesized report within <synthesized_text> tags, and a set of provided sources/documents.\n- Output: The same report, but with citations inserted (in the specified format) within <exact_text_with_citation> tags.\n\nKey Rules & Guidelines\n\n1. DO NOT Change the Original Text\n- The content inside <synthesized_text> must remain 100% identical; only insert citations—no wording, punctuation, or whitespace modifications.\n\n2. Citation Placement\n- Add citations only where a claim, fact, or statement is directly supported by the provided source documents.\n- Place citations at the end of sentences (after the period) wherever possible.\n- Only use multiple citations within a sentence when clearly necessary (e.g., different claims in the same sentence, each supported by a different source).\n\n3. Avoid Over-Citation\n- Do not cite basic facts or common knowledge.\n- Do not cite multiple times to the same source within a single sentence.\n- Do not cite individual words or fragments—cite complete, meaningful claims.\n\n4. Output Format\n- Return the modified report within <exact_text_with_citation> tags.\n- Do not output any other text or information.\n\nExample\n\nSuppose the input is:\n\n<synthesized_text>\nClimate change has led to rising sea levels.
