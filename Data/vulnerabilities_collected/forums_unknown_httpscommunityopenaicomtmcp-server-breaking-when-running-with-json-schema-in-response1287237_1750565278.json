          "response": "It looks like your message got cut off, but I understand you have an MCP server and you want to use OpenAI’s response API (possibly with function calling or tools) to:\n\n1. Get an initial output from a tool or function.\n2. Have the AI consider that output before generating a final output in a certain JSON schema.\n\nYou mention that this works when you use text: format: ‘...’ (but the message was incomplete).\n\nLet me clarify and help you troubleshoot or structure the solution:\n\n### General Approach\n\n1. **Call a Tool or Function (via OpenAI tools/function calling):**\n    - You define a function/tool (e.g. in your OpenAI deployment or via the request payload).\n    - The AI calls this tool, which returns data (e.g. from your MCP server or a plugin).\n\n2. **Pass Tool Output Back to AI:**\n    - The tool’s output is returned as part of the conversation context.\n    - The AI model then considers this output as it generates the next response.\n\n3. **Ask the AI to Output in a Specific JSON Schema:**\n    - Your user/system prompt should direct the AI to return its final output in your desired JSON schema, referencing the tool’s output as needed.\n\n---\n\n## Example (OpenAI Function Calling)\n\n**Step 1: Define Your Function/Tool**\n```json\n{\n  \"name\": \"get_mcp_data\",\n  \"description\": \"Get data from MCP server.\",\n  \"parameters\": {\n    \"type\": \"object\",\n    \"properties\": {\n      \"query\": {\n        \"type\": \"string\",\n        \"description\": \"Query for MCP server\"\n      }\n    },\n    \"required\": [\"query\"]\n  }\n}\n```\n\n**Step 2: User Message**\n```json\n{\n  \"role\": \"user\",\n  \"content\": \"Get the MCP data for item 42 and summarize it in this JSON schema: {\\\"summary\\\": string, \\\"details\\\": object}\"\n}\n```\n\n**Step 3: AI Calls the Tool**\n- The OpenAI API returns a `function_call` for `get_mcp_data` with `{\"query\": \"item 42\"}`.\n\n**Step 4: Your Server Calls the MCP Server**\n- Your code calls the MCP server, gets the data, and returns it as the tool’s output.\n\n**Step 5: Final AI Response**\n- You send the tool’s output back to the OpenAI API as a function response.\n- The AI now sees both the user’s request and the tool’s output.\n- The AI generates a response in your specified JSON schema, referencing the tool output.\n\n---\n\n## Troubleshooting Common Issues\n\n- **If it only works with text format:**  \n  - Ensure your function/tool output is being passed back to OpenAI in the correct way, as a tool/function response, not just as plain text.\n  - Make sure your system/user prompt is clear about the required output format.\n  - If the final response isn’t formatted as JSON, try giving a stronger system prompt like:  \n    “When generating your final answer, only output valid JSON matching this schema: {…}”\n\n- **Model Not Considering Tool Output:**  \n  - Double-check the sequence:  \n    1. User prompt →  \n    2. AI calls tool →  \n    3. Tool returns data →  \n    4. AI gets both the prompt & data, and produces final output.\n  - If you skip step 4 or do not pass the tool output as a function response, the AI will not “see” it.\n\n---\n\n## Example OpenAI API Sequence\n\n```json\n// User prompt\n{ \"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"Get data for item X and summarize it as JSON.\" }\n\n// AI response: function_call\n{\n  \"role\": \"assistant\",\n  \"content\": null,\n  \"function_call\": {\n    \"name\": \"get_mcp_data\",\n    \"arguments\": \"{\\\"query\\\": \\\"item X\\\"}\"\n  }\n}\n\n// Your code: calls MCP server, gets data, e.g. { \"raw_data\": \"...\" }\n\n// Send function response\n{\n  \"role\": \"function\",\n  \"name\": \"get_mcp_data\",\n  \"content\": \"{\\\"raw_data\\\": \\\"...\\\"}\"\n}\n\n// AI final response (after seeing function output)\n{\n  \"role\": \"assistant\",\n  \"content\": \"{ \\\"summary\\\": \\\"...\\\", \\\"details\\\": { ... } }\"\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n## If You’re Using `openai.response.parse`\n\nIf you’re using openai.response.parse or similar parsing tools:\n\n- Make sure you parse the final response, not the tool output.\n- If you want a specific format, reinforce it in the prompt.\n\n---\n\n## If You Need More Help\n\nIf you paste your actual payloads/code snippets, or clarify what exactly doesn’t work (and what you mean by “it works whenever I use text: format: …”), I can provide a more tailored solution!\n\nLet me know your specific error or the point where it fails, and I’ll help you debug it.",

          "response": "Below is a general walkthrough for chaining tool outputs into a final JSON response using OpenAI’s API. Although there are several ways to accomplish this, one straightforward approach is:\n\n1. Call the tool (or function) and gather the result.  \n2. Provide that result back to the AI, along with instructions to integrate it into a final JSON schema.  \n3. Parse or validate the final response as JSON before returning it to the client (e.g., via openai.response.parse or a custom parser).\n\nBelow is a simplified example demonstrating the process. Assume you have:\n\n• An MCP server or any “tool” that returns some intermediate data.  \n• A final JSON schema you want the AI to return.  \n• A function or method (like openai.response.parse) that checks/parses the JSON output.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n1) Call the Tool and Store the Output\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nSuppose your MCP server returns a simple dictionary with data (or maybe it returns text that you convert into a dictionary). For example:\n\ntool_output = {\n    \"title\": \"My Tool Result\",\n    \"value\": 42\n}\n\nIn a real scenario, this might come from a network call or a function invocation.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n2) Provide the Tool Output to OpenAI with Instructions\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWhen you send a prompt to OpenAI, instruct the model to consider the tool output before producing the final JSON. One effective pattern is to pass the tool-output as part of your system or user message and ask the model to incorporate it.\n\nFor instance (pseudocode):\n\nprompt = \"\"\"\nYou are given the following tool output:\n\ntool_output = {tool_output}\n\nUsing this information, output valid JSON that follows the schema:\n{\n  \"summary\": string,\n  \"details\": {\n    \"toolTitle\": string,\n    \"toolValue\": number,\n    \"recommendation\": string\n  }\n}\n\nRequirements:\n- Summarize the result of the tool_output in \"summary\".\n- Put tool_output's title in \"details.toolTitle\".\n- Put tool_output's value in \"details.toolValue\".\n- Add a \"recommendation\" in \"details.recommendation\".\n\nOutput only valid JSON, with no extra keys and no markdown formatting.\n\"\"\"\n\nresponse = openai.ChatCompletion.create(\n    model=\"gpt-3.5-turbo\",\n    messages=[{\"role\": \"system\", \"content\": prompt}],\n    temperature=0\n)\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n3) Use a JSON Parser or openai.response.parse\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nDepending on your environment, you can use either a built-in JSON parser, a library, or OpenAI’s openai.response.parse (if that’s part of your pipeline). For example:\n\ntry:\n    parsed_json = json.loads(response[\"choices\"][0][\"message\"][\"content\"])\n    # or if you have openai.response.parse, it may look like:\n    # parsed_json = openai.response.parse(response[\"choices\"][0][\"message\"][\"content\"])\n    \n    # Now we can do something with parsed_json:\n    # e.g., return it to your client, store it, etc.\nexcept json.JSONDecodeError as e:\n    # Handle invalid JSON (e.g., re-prompt the model or clean the response)\n    print(\"JSON parse error:\", e)\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nTroubleshooting Tips\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n• Make sure the instructions in your prompt are extremely explicit about outputting valid JSON (no extra text, no markdown formatting). The model tends to insert extra text (like “Here’s your JSON…” or code fences) if not tightly controlled.  \n\n• If you are using openai.response.parse, confirm it expects a very strict JSON format. Even newline characters or code blocks can break strict parsers. One strategy:  \n  – Instruct the model: “Do not add any code fences. Output only valid JSON.”  \n  – Or, if possible, use the new function-calling approach in the OpenAI ChatCompletion API, which can ensure structured JSON.  \n\n• If you are returning the JSON to an MCP server (or another microservice), ensure you’re not accidentally double-encoding strings or including them in a nested JSON structure.  \n\n• If you find that the AI is including disclaimers or extra text, experiment with adding further “system” instructions like:  \n  “You must output only JSON. Do not include any other formatting, text, or commentary.”  \n\n• Verify that your final step either:  \n  – Uses a robust JSON validator.  \n  – Implements built-in error handling for common issues (like trailing commas or unexpected text).  \n\nThis general pattern—tool output → AI instructions + schema → parse final JSON—should work regardless of whether you are using text completions or chat completions, as long as your instructions are explicit, you handle any potential formatting quirks, and you parse/validate carefully at the end. If you continue to run into issues, enable debug logs or print out the exact string that the model returns to see if there are hidden characters or formatting that break JSON parsing.",

I’d be happy to help, but I need a bit more information to understand exactly what’s happening.\n\nA few clarifying questions that might help narrow things down:\n\n1. When you say “it works whenever I use text: format: …”, what exactly is the text format you’re supplying? Are you formatting the tool’s output differently when you eventually pass it to openai.response.parse?\n\n2. How are you integrating the tool’s output into the final prompt? For example, are you appending it to the system or user messages, or using some kind of chain-of-thought mechanism?\n\n3. Do you have an example of the intermediate output and the expected final JSON schema? Sometimes how you instruct the model (or the parsing tool) can affect whether it “considers” the intermediate output in the final answer.\n\n4. What errors or mismatches are you seeing when not using the “text:” format? Are you getting parse errors on the JSON side, or does the AI not “consider” the earlier output properly?\n\nA general suggestion in situations like this is to ensure that:\n • You clearly indicate in your prompt that the tool’s output should be treated as context for the final output.\n • You include clear instructions on how the final answer should incorporate that intermediate result into the JSON schema.\n • The message formatting (or use of quoted text/delimiters) is consistent so that the parser can recognize the contents properly.\n\nIf you can share a code snippet or more detailed examples of the prompt structure, the tool’s output, and the exact instructions you’re sending (with any relevant error messages), I’ll be able to offer more specific guidance on how to get everything working together.\n\nLet me know what further details you can provide and we can debug this step by step!",

Make the tool call and get the output.\n2. Pass the tool output to the AI model as part of the context.\n3. Ask the AI to consider the tool output and generate a response in the desired JSON schema.\n\nHere's a basic example of how you might structure this:\n\n```python\nimport openai\nimport json\nfrom your_mcp_module import MCPServer  # Import your MCP server module\n\n# Initialize OpenAI API client\nopenai.api_key = 'your-api-key'\n\n# Initialize MCP server\nmcp_server = MCPServer()  # Your MCP server setup\n\ndef get_tool_output(query):\n    # Use your MCP server to get the tool output\n    tool_output = mcp_server.process_query(query)\n    return tool_output\n\ndef generate_ai_response(context, tool_output):\n    prompt = f\"\"\"\n    Context: {context}\n    Tool Output: {tool_output}\n    \n    Consider the above context and tool output, and generate a response in the following JSON schema:\n    {{\n        \"summary\": \"A brief summary of the situation\",\n        \"analysis\": \"An analysis based on the context and tool output\",\n        \"recommendation\": \"A recommendation based on the analysis\"\n    }}\n    \"\"\"\n\n    response = openai.Completion.create(\n        engine=\"text-davinci-002\",\n        prompt=prompt,\n        max_tokens=300,\n        n=1,\n        stop=None,\n        temperature=0.7,\n    )\n\n    return response.choices[0].text.strip()\n\n# Main process\ncontext = \"User is asking about weather conditions for a planned outdoor event.\"\nquery = \"Get current weather forecast\"\n\ntool_output = get_tool_output(query)\nai_response = generate_ai_response(context, tool_output)\n\n# Parse the JSON response\ntry:\n    parsed_response = json.loads(ai_response)\n    print(json.dumps(parsed_response, indent=2))\nexcept json.JSONDecodeError:\n    print(\"Failed to parse AI response as JSON\")\n    print(ai_response)\n```\n\nIn this example:\n\n1. We define a function `get_tool_output()` that uses the MCP server to process a query and return the tool output.\n\n2. The `generate_ai_response()` function takes the context and tool output, constructs a prompt that includes both, and asks the AI to generate a response in the specified JSON schema.\n\n3. In the main process, we:\n   - Set a context and query\n   - Get the tool output using the MCP server\n   - Generate an AI response considering both the context and tool output\n   - Parse the AI response as JSON and print it\n\nMake sure to replace `'your-api-key'` with your actual OpenAI API key and adjust the MCP server integration according to your specific setup.\n\nThis approach allows you to get the tool output from your MCP server, provide it as context to the AI model, and then generate a structured response in the desired JSON format.",

It sounds like you want to:\n\n- Use OpenAI’s API to get responses.\n- Parse those responses using openai.response.parse.\n- Use a certain schema (probably JSON schema) to validate or structure output.\n- Integrate this with an MCP (your server).\n\nLet me clarify your workflow and provide a pattern you could follow:\n\n1. You send a prompt to OpenAI’s API, specifying a desired schema (using tools like function calling, tool use, or JSON mode).\n2. OpenAI’s response is in JSON or structured format.\n3. You use openai.response.parse (likely from OpenAI’s Python SDK) to parse or validate the response against your schema.\n4. Your server (MCP) processes the output.\n\nSample Python Code (using OpenAI v1 API):\n\nimport openai\n\nopenai.api_key = \"YOUR_API_KEY\"\n\n# Step 1: Define a function schema\nschema = {\n    \"name\": \"get_weather\",\n    \"description\": \"Get the weather in a location\",\n    \"parameters\": {\n        \"type\": \"object\",\n        \"properties\": {\n            \"location\": {\"type\": \"string\", \"description\": \"The city and state\"}\n        },\n        \"required\": [\"location\"],\n    },\n}\n\n# Step 2: Send a prompt using function calling (or JSON mode)\nresponse = openai.ChatCompletion.create(\n    model=\"gpt-4-turbo\",\n    messages=[{\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"What's the weather in Paris?\"}],\n    functions=[schema],\n    function_call=\"auto\",\n)\n\n# Step 3: Parse the response\nparsed = openai.response.parse(response)\n\n# Step 4: Use in your MCP server\nprint(parsed)  # You can now pass 'parsed' to your MCP logic\n\nNotes:\n\n- The openai.response.parse function is available in v1 of OpenAI’s Python SDK. It parses the response according to the schema you provide.\n- You can use \"I\" in your schema’s descriptions or output as the assistant’s persona if desired.\n- If you want the model to use \"I\" in its textual response, instruct it in your system prompt or schema descriptions.\n\nIf you provide more details (your exact schema, what you want the output to look like, your programming language), I can give a more tailored example!\n\nLet me know if you want a code sample for a different language or have a specific schema in mind.",

Create a JSON object with the fields title, key-findings, and recommended-actions. Output only valid JSON and nothing else.”\n\n4) Incorporate openai.response.parse (if you’re using an official or community library) to handle the final JSON.  \n   - Tools like openai.response.parse typically require that the AI responds with structured data.  \n   - Make sure to clarify in your system or user messages that the AI must return valid JSON.\n\n5) Handle edge cases to ensure reliable JSON.  \n   - Sometimes the AI might return extraneous text or invalid JSON.  \n   - You can instruct the AI more strongly, for example: “Return only JSON. Do not include markdown. Do not add commentary.”\n\nIn practical terms, you might do something like:\n\n• Step 1 (Intermediate response)  \n  Prompt: “Please list the top three points from the text below, each prefixed with 'Point #x:' … [your text]. Return only in raw text with the prefix ‘Points:’ to mark the start.”  \n\n• Your code or server (MCP) extracts the lines following “Points:” from the AI’s response.  \n\n• Step 2 (Final JSON response)  \n  Prompt uses the extracted points:  \n  “Based on the following points: ‹extracted_points›, output valid JSON in the format:  \n  {  \n    \"topPoints\": [ … ],  \n    \"summary\": \"…\"  \n  }  \n  Return only JSON. No extra text.”  \n\nIf you still run into issues, please share a snippet of how you’re sending the prompts or how you’re calling the OpenAI API, and we can troubleshoot further.  ",

Function Calling (OpenAI API)\nIf you use the function calling feature, you can ask the AI to call a function/tool, and then have the output passed back in. The OpenAI API handles this with \"tool_calls\" (in the new v1/chat/completions) or \"function_call\" (older).\n\n#### 2. Chaining Prompts\nYou can do this in two steps:\n- Step 1: Call the API with a prompt that asks for the tool output.\n- Step 2: Use the tool output as context in a second prompt, instructing the AI to \"consider\" it and generate the final JSON.\n\n#### 3. Single prompt with parsing\nSometimes you can do both in one call by specifying a prompt like:\n> First, run TOOL_X with input Y and give the output. Then, considering the TOOL_X output, produce a JSON object like {...}.\n\nBut this can be brittle if you want strict separation between steps or must guarantee schema accuracy.\n\n---\n\n## What to Watch Out For\n\n- **Context Passing:** You must ensure the tool output is passed as part of the context for the AI to \"consider\" it. If the tool output is generated externally, make sure it's included in the next prompt or message.\n- **Role/Format Issues:** If it only works with text: format: but not with tool outputs, check how your MCP server handles response roles and message types. The OpenAI API expects specific message roles (`system`, `user`, `assistant`, `tool`).\n- **JSON Schema Enforcement:** Use schema guidelines in your prompt, or leverage OpenAI's function calling with a function schema to improve structured output reliability.\n\n---\n\n## Example (Pseudocode)\n\n### Step 1: Get Tool Output\n\n```json\n{\n  \"role\": \"user\",\n  \"content\": \"Run TOOL_X with input Y.\"\n}\n```\n\n- [TOOL_X runs, outputs Z]\n\n### Step 2: Final Output Request\n\n```json\n{\n  \"role\": \"user\",\n  \"content\": \"Given TOOL_X output: Z, generate a JSON object with the following schema: { ... }.\"\n}\n```\n\nOR using function calling:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"role\": \"user\",\n  \"content\": \"Do X\",\n  \"tools\": [\n    {\n      \"type\": \"function\",\n      \"function\": {\n        \"name\": \"TOOL_X\",\n        \"parameters\": { ... }\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n- The API returns a `tool_calls` object,\n- You call your tool, get the result,\n- Pass the result as a message with `\"role\": \"tool\", \"content\": \"{output}\"`,\n- The assistant then uses this to compose the final JSON.\n\n---\n\n## Troubleshooting Tips\n\n- **Check how your MCP server handles multi-step conversations and message roles.**\n- **Make sure the tool output is included as a message with `\"role\": \"tool\"` if using function calling.**\n- **If using `openai.response.parse`, ensure it's parsing and forwarding the tool output properly.**\n- **If you want stricter schema adherence, provide a JSON schema and explicit instructions in the prompt, or use function calling with schema enforcement.**\n\n---\n\n## Example JSON Schema Prompt\n\n```json\n{\n  \"role\": \"user\",\n  \"content\": \"Given TOOL_X output: Z, respond ONLY with a JSON object of the form: {\\\"summary\\\": string, \\\"details\\\": string, \\\"risk_level\\\": \\\"low\\\"|\\\"medium\\\"|\\\"high\\\"}. Do not include any extra text.\"\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n## Summary\n\n- Make sure each step's output is cleanly passed as context for the next.\n- Use message roles and function calling if possible for structure.\n- If stuck, share your exact prompt/messages and any error or undesired output you get; I can offer more specific advice!\n\nIf you have code snippets or API calls that aren't working as expected, please share them (redact sensitive info), and I can help debug further.",

          "response": "Below is a general approach showing how you might orchestrate an “intermediate output → final output” workflow using OpenAI alongside an MCP server to generate a specific JSON schema response. The details may differ based on your particular setup (e.g., Node.js, Python, or another environment), but the high-level pattern remains similar. You can adapt this to your own environment and libraries (e.g., your “MCP server” code and how you handle requests/responses).\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n1. The General Workflow\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n\n1. User Query → (MCP Server) → OpenAI API\n   • You receive a user’s prompt or request in your MCP server.\n   • You forward that request to OpenAI (e.g., using OpenAI’s /v1/chat/completions or /v1/completions endpoints).\n\n2. OpenAI Response → (MCP Server) → Parsers / Logic\n   • Once you get the response from OpenAI, you parse or post-process that “intermediate output.”\n   • For example, if you need to specifically parse some data points from the LLM’s textual response, you might:\n       – Use a regex or JSON parse technique if the response is clearly structured, or\n       – Use OpenAI function-calling if you have structured output in mind (see below for more details).\n\n3. Generate Final JSON Schema Output → (MCP Server)\n   • Based on the parsed or extracted result from the LLM, you prepare your final output in JSON according to the schema you’ve defined.\n   • Send that final JSON output to the user or the next stage in your pipeline.\n\nIf your pipeline requires the AI to reason about the “intermediate output” in a second step of inference, you could do something like:\n   – Step A: Original query with a specific system prompt telling the LLM to produce partially structured data or short answers you can parse easily.\n   – Step B: Feed the parsed data plus your chosen instructions (or context) back to the LLM in a new conversation turn, asking it to finalize the JSON structure.\n\nBelow is a simplified Node.js-like example to illustrate. (You could do the same in Python or other languages.)\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n2.

Using Function Calling for Strict JSON\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n\nIf you want to avoid risking output that isn’t valid JSON, consider using OpenAI’s function calling feature (available in GPT-3.5-Turbo and GPT-4). You define a “function” in your prompt with a JSON schema. The LLM (GPT) will return a JSON response in the function_call property directly, which you can parse reliably. The flow then looks like:\n\n1. Provide the “function” definition in your /chat/completions call with a name, description, and parameters that reflect your JSON schema. \n2. The model returns a structured JSON object in the function_call. \n3. Your code can parse function_call.arguments without worrying about messy string-based JSON.\n\nFor details, see the official documentation on function calling:\nhttps://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/gpt/function-calling\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n4. Common Pitfalls and Tips\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n\n• Response Cleaning: The LLM might add extra explanation or formatting. You might need to do some string manipulation to isolate valid JSON. \n• Ask for JSON “only”: In your system/user prompt, you can strongly instruct: “Output only valid JSON, no additional text.” \n• Validate JSON: Use robust JSON schema validation if needed. \n• Security: Since this is a security assessment, ensure you handle potential injection attacks carefully. Never blindly execute code based on the LLM output. \n• Re-Verification Step: For critical or sensitive usage, consider verifying or sanitizing any LLM-generated fields before using them in your system.\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n\nHopefully this gives you a solid starting point for orchestrating intermediate and final outputs in JSON. The key steps are:  \n1) Get your “intermediate” data from the first call,  \n2) Parse it or transform it,  \n3) Use that data in a second call (or additional logic) to produce your final JSON schema.  \n\nYou can adapt the above boilerplate to suit your language, runtime, and desired JSON schema. If you run into any specific errors (like parsing failures or unexpected output), you can refine prompts or apply more rigorous validation (including function calling).",

However, your description got cut off (and there might also be a typo or two), so please let me know if I’ve misunderstood your setup. Based on what I gathered, here are a few pointers:\n\n1. Two‑Stage Prompting:\n  • In the first stage, clearly instruct the AI (or your MCP server, if it’s acting as a middleware) to produce the “certain output” you need.\n  • In the second stage, pass that output (either as context in the prompt or as a variable) along with clear instructions on the JSON schema format you expect.\n  • Make sure the intermediate result is captured correctly so it can be integrated into your follow‑up prompt. For example, you might render it as a variable like {intermediate_result} that you then insert into your second prompt.\n\n2. Using openai.response.parse:\n  • If you’re relying on openai.response.parse to convert the API’s text-format reply into a JSON object (or to validate the format), ensure that your prompt explicitly shows how the final answer should be structured as JSON.\n  • You might need to include sample output in your prompt so the model understands the schema you want.\n\n3. Prompt Clarity:\n  • When instructing the AI, remove any ambiguous markers such as “---” or “###” unless they have a defined meaning in your parser. Often these symbols can confuse the prompt or the parser.\n  • Provide explicit instructions like “Output exactly in this JSON format:” followed by a precise schema sample.\n\n4. Chaining Considerations:\n  • If you’re trying for a chain-of-thought process in which the intermediate output is “considered” when making the final decision, make sure the second prompt makes that explicit. For example: “Given the result {intermediate_result} from the earlier step, produce a final answer that adheres to this JSON format…”\n  • Alternatively, consider using function calls or a multi‑turn dialogue where one turn produces the intermediate step and the next turn “conditions” on that output.\n\nIf you’re still having issues when you use text format “text:” (as mentioned in your message), double‑check that:\n  – The formatting instructions are not being stripped or reformatted by your MCP server.\n  – The openai.response.parse function is set up to correctly parse the text output into JSON.\n\nCould you please clarify if you’re experiencing an error (and if so, what the error is), or if the final output is simply not matching the desired JSON schema? Also, if you can provide a more complete snippet of your code or prompts, that would help diagnose the issue more precisely.",

Clarify the Workflow Clearly:\nMake sure your workflow is structured clearly, for example:\n\n```\nUser Input --> MCP Server --> MCP Server output --> OpenAI API (consider MCP output) --> Final JSON Schema output\n```\n\n### 2. Ensure Proper Input Formatting:\nIf you're using something like `openai.response.parse`, make sure your input to OpenAI is consistently structured and explicitly instructs the model to consider the MCP server output.\n\nFor instance, clearly prompt the model:\n\n```text\n\"Given the following MCP output:\n###\n<insert MCP output>\n###\n\nPlease produce a final response adhering strictly to this JSON schema:\n{\n   \"key1\": \"...\",\n   \"key2\": \"...\"\n}\n```\n\n### 3. Use Clear Delimiters:\nClearly mark the MCP output’s boundaries using delimiters like `###` or `\"\"\"`, so the AI can accurately understand the context.\n\nFor example:\n\n```text\n\"Consider this MCP output:\n###\n<insert MCP output>\n###\n\nBased on the above, generate the final output in the following JSON schema:\n{\n  \"output\": \"...\",\n  \"status\": \"...\"\n}\"\n```\n\n### 4. Explicitly Request JSON Format:\nAlways explicitly request JSON formatting from the OpenAI API. For example, your prompt might end with:\n\n```text\n\"Provide your response strictly as valid JSON matching the following schema...\"\n```\n\n### 5. Check API Parameters and Formatting:\n- Ensure the parameter `response_format` is correctly set wherever applicable.\n- If you're using a library or wrapper that parses responses, confirm you're using the correct function calls, e.g. `openai.ChatCompletion.create()` with `response_format={\"type\": \"json_object\"}` (if applicable to your use case).\n\n### 6. Debug Incrementally:\nTry sending simpler requests first. Ensure basic integration works, then gradually add complexity. If a simpler text format works but JSON output fails, isolate precisely why:\n\n- Does the model fail to parse MCP output?\n- Does the model fail to format the final JSON?\n- Is the MCP server output inconsistent or causing confusion?\n\n### Example Prompt to Test:\nHere's a simplified example to test your integration:\n\n```text\n\"MCP Server Output:\n###\nTemperature: 23°C\nPressure: 101.3 kPa\nStatus: OK\n###\n\nNow, based on the above data, output your response strictly in JSON format as follows:\n{\n   \"temperature_celsius\": \"<number>\",\n   \"pressure_kpa\": \"<number>\",\n   \"status\": \"<string>\"\n}\"\n```\n\nThis helps verify that the AI correctly consumes MCP output and generates JSON output.\n\n### 7. Check for Typos and Formatting Errors:\nYour original message had some typos (`thenn`, `oepnAI`, and `c3rtain`). Be sure these typos don’t exist in your actual prompts or code, as they may confuse the model or cause parsing errors.\n\n---\n\nIf you can provide more detail about your specific MCP output, the current prompts you’re using, and the specific issue/error you're encountering, I can help you craft a more precise solution.",

It works with text format but not with structured output\n\nHere are some common issues and solutions:\n\n## Potential Issues with Structured Output\n\n### 1. Tool Output Integration\nWhen using `openai.response.parse()` with structured output, make sure you're properly integrating the tool results:\n\n```python\n# Example structure\nresponse = client.beta.chat.completions.parse(\n    model=\"gpt-4o\",\n    messages=[\n        {\"role\": \"system\", \"content\": \"You are a helpful assistant that uses tools and returns structured data.\"},\n        {\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"Your request here\"},\n        # Tool results should be included in messages\n        {\"role\": \"tool\", \"tool_call_id\": \"...\", \"content\": str(tool_result)},\n    ],\n    response_format=YourPydanticModel,\n    tools=[...],  # Your MCP tools\n)\n```\n\n### 2. Two-Step Process\nConsider breaking it into two API calls:\n\n```python\n# Step 1: Get tool output\nfirst_response = client.chat.completions.create(\n    model=\"gpt-4o\",\n    messages=[...],\n    tools=[your_mcp_tool],\n)\n\n# Extract tool results\ntool_results = # ... process tool calls\n\n# Step 2: Generate structured output considering tool results\nfinal_response = client.beta.chat.completions.parse(\n    model=\"gpt-4o\",\n    messages=[\n        {\"role\": \"system\", \"content\": \"Based on the tool output, generate the final response.\"},\n        {\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": f\"Tool output: {tool_results}\\n\\nGenerate final response.\"}\n    ],\n    response_format=YourSchema,\n)\n```\n\n### 3. Schema Compatibility\nEnsure your JSON schema is compatible with structured output:\n\n```python\nfrom pydantic import BaseModel\nfrom typing import Optional\n\nclass YourOutputSchema(BaseModel):\n    # Make sure all fields are properly typed\n    result: str\n    confidence: Optional[float] = None\n    metadata: Optional[dict] = None\n```\n\nCould you share:\n1.

However, I’ll try to address your use case and help you troubleshoot!\n\n### Your Setup (from what you described)\n- **MCP server**: (Assuming it's a custom or domain-specific middleware/control point)\n- **OpenAI API**: Using response parsing (openai.response.parse), possibly with function calling or tool use.\n- **Goal**:\n  1. Run a tool (via the API)\n  2. Get its output\n  3. Have the AI consider that output\n  4. Get a final output in a certain JSON schema\n\nIt works **when you use `text: format:`** (your message got cut here).\n\n---\n\n## Some Interpretations\n\n- You might be using the OpenAI “function calling” or “tool calling” features with the \"response_format\": \"text\" or \"response_format\": \"json_object\".\n- You're having trouble getting the AI to take tool output into account unless you use a certain format.\n\n---\n\n## General Guidance\n\n### 1. Using Tool Outputs in OpenAI API\n\nWhen you use tools (functions) with the OpenAI API, the flow is:\n\n1. **Send user message** → AI decides to call a tool.\n2. **API returns function/tool call** → You run that tool on your server.\n3. **Send tool output back as a tool message** → AI gets to see the tool output and then responds.\n\n#### Example Sequence\n\n```json\n# 1. User prompt\n{\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"Get data and summarize it.\"}\n\n# 2. Assistant (AI) responds with a tool call\n{\n  \"role\": \"assistant\",\n  \"content\": null,\n  \"tool_calls\": [\n    {\n      \"id\": \"...\",\n      \"type\": \"function\",\n      \"function\": {\n        \"name\": \"get_data\",\n        \"arguments\": \"{...}\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}\n\n# 3. You run the tool, then send result as:\n{\n  \"role\": \"tool\",\n  \"tool_call_id\": \"...\",\n  \"content\": \"{result_of_get_data}\"\n}\n\n# 4. AI sees the tool result and can now generate the final answer (in JSON if you specify)\n```\n\n### 2. Forcing JSON Schema Output\n\nTo get the final output in a specific JSON schema:\n\n- In your final user message or system prompt, specify:\n  - “Respond ONLY in the following JSON schema: { ... }”\n- Or, use `\"response_format\": \"json_object\"` with the OpenAI API (gpt-4-1106-preview and similar support this).\n\n#### Example:\n\n```python\nresponse = openai.chat.completions.create(\n    model=\"gpt-4-1106-preview\",\n    messages=messages,\n    tools=[...],\n    tool_choice=\"auto\",\n    response_format={\"type\": \"json_object\"},\n)\n```\n\n### 3. Common Issues\n\n- If you use `\"response_format\": \"json_object\"`, the assistant's final output will be a JSON object.\n- If you use `\"response_format\": \"text\"`, you get a text answer.\n- Sometimes, the AI won't “see” the tool output unless you properly feed it as a tool message (see above).\n- Make sure the tool output is concise and in a format the AI can easily parse.\n\n---\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\n- **If it only works with `text` format**: Maybe your tool or prompt isn’t fully compatible with `json_object` output; ensure your prompts and schemas are clear and don't conflict.\n- **If the AI isn’t “considering” the tool output**: Double-check that your message chain includes the tool output as a tool message before the final assistant message.\n\n---\n\n## Example Message Chain\n\n```json\n[\n  {\"role\": \"system\", \"content\": \"You are a helpful assistant...\"},\n  {\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"Get weather and summarize it as JSON.\"},\n  {\"role\": \"assistant\", \"tool_calls\": [...]},           # tool call\n  {\"role\": \"tool\", \"tool_call_id\": \"...\", \"content\": \"{...weather data...}\"},\n  {\"role\": \"assistant\", \"content\": \"{...final JSON...}\"}\n]\n```\n\n---\n\n## If You Need More Help\n\n- **Paste your actual failing message chain (redact sensitive info!)**\n- **Clarify what you mean by “it works whenever I use text: format:”** (what fails when you use JSON? What error or wrong output do you get?)\n\nI can give more precise advice with more detail!",

It sounds like you have an MCP server that calls the OpenAI responses API (using openai.response.parse) to generate some intermediate output, and then you want the AI to use that output as context to produce a final JSON response according to a given schema. Is that correct?\n\nA couple of follow-up questions to help me better understand your setup:\n\n1. What does your overall flow look like? For example, do you first call a tool that returns some text output and then pass that output as part of the prompt to the next API call?\n\n2. When you mention “text: format: …”, do you mean that when you explicitly format your intermediate output as plain text the JSON schema output is generated correctly? And if so, how are you transitioning from that plain text output to the final JSON output?\n\n3. Could you provide a small example of the input prompt you’re using and the example JSON schema you expect? Sometimes when embedding tool outputs you may need to be explicit in your instructions (e.g., “Take the following tool output and now, following the schema below, generate …”) so that the model can reconcile both parts correctly.\n\nSome general tips that might help:\n\n• Chain your instructions carefully. If you’re feeding the intermediate output as part of your prompt, ensure that your prompt clearly demarcates it (for example, by using delimiters or explicit labels). This gives the model a clear structure to follow when incorporating the tool response into the final JSON schema.\n\n• If you’re using a library like openai.response.parse to handle your output parsing, double-check that the formatting (e.g., line breaks, quotes, etc.) is exactly what the parser expects. Inconsistent formatting can cause the parser to fail to identify the correct JSON structure.\n\n• If you have a two-step process (first generating an output and then referencing it), ensure that the second prompt contains examples or explicit instructions that show how the earlier output should be considered in formulating the final JSON.\n\nWith a bit more detail about how you’re constructing your calls and a sample of the prompts you’re using, I can provide more targeted suggestions.

          "response": "It looks like your message got cut off at the end, but I understand you’re working with an MCP server, using the OpenAI API, and want to:\n\n1. Have the AI use a tool (possibly via tool_calls or function calling).\n2. Get the tool’s output.\n3. Have the AI \"consider\" that tool output before making its final response.\n4. Format the final AI output in a particular JSON schema.\n\nYou also mention things work when you use text: format, but perhaps not when using tools.\n\nLet’s clarify how to approach this with OpenAI's API and what the workflow typically looks like:\n\n### 1. OpenAI Tool (Function Calling) Workflow\n\nWhen you use function-calling (tools) with the OpenAI GPT API, the normal flow is:\n\n- You send a user message and a list of tool/function definitions.\n- The model may decide to \"call\" a tool/function, returning a tool_calls field in the response.\n- Your server (the \"tool handler\") receives this, executes the tool, and then sends the tool’s output back to the model as a function response (with role: \"tool\").\n- The model then produces a final response, which can take the tool output into account.\n\n### 2. Ensuring the Model \"Considers\" the Tool Output\n\nTo ensure the model uses the tool output, you must:\n\n- After the tool call, send a new API request with all previous messages PLUS a message from the \"tool\" role containing the tool output.\n- The model will then respond, and you can specify your desired output format/schema in the prompt or via a system message.\n\n### 3. JSON Output Schema\n\nIf you want the model’s final output in a specific JSON schema, you must tell it. For example, include in the system message:\n\nYou are an API that must output your answer as JSON in the following schema:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"result\": \"string\",\n  \"confidence\": \"float\"\n}\n```\n\nOr whatever your schema is.\n\n### 4. Your Issue with `openai.response.parse`\n\nIf you’re using openai.response.parse or an equivalent, make sure:\n\n- You’re parsing the correct part of the response (possibly model message content, or tool output).\n- If you expect the output as JSON, you might need to extract it from the model’s text content.\n\n### 5. Example Flow\n\nHere's a sample conversation with the OpenAI API:\n\n**Step 1:** User asks a question, you send this to the API with tool definitions.\n\n**Step 2:** Model responds with tool_calls:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"role\": \"assistant\",\n  \"content\": null,\n  \"tool_calls\": [\n    {\n      \"id\": \"call_123\",\n      \"type\": \"function\",\n      \"function\": {\n        \"name\": \"get_data\",\n        \"arguments\": \"{\\\"query\\\": \\\"foo\\\"}\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n**Step 3:** Your server executes get_data, gets a result, then sends back:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"role\": \"tool\",\n  \"tool_call_id\": \"call_123\",\n  \"content\": \"{\\\"data\\\": \\\"bar\\\", \\\"score\\\": 0.95}\"\n}\n```\n\n**Step 4:** Model now produces a final response, which you can constrain via prompt/system message to be in your JSON schema.\n\n### 6. Key Tips\n\n- Always include all previous messages in the API call, including user, assistant (with tool_calls), and tool (with tool results).\n- Use system messages to tell the model to output JSON.\n- If you want to parse the JSON result, use a tool like json.loads() on the model’s content, after ensuring the content is valid JSON.\n\n---\n\n**If you’re having trouble at a specific step (e.g., the model doesn’t use the tool output, or the JSON format is wrong), please clarify or paste your code/prompt, and I can give more concrete advice.**\n\nIf you finish your message (after \"format: '\"), I can also give more targeted help!",

          "response": "It sounds like you’re partially implementing a chain of calls:\n\n• First, you want to “run some code” or get certain data inside your server (the “MCP server”), and then\n• You want to pass that result to OpenAI’s API,\n• Then you want OpenAI to process that result further (e.g., parse it, analyze it, transform it), and finally\n• You want OpenAI to return a JSON-formatted output that follows a specific schema.\n\nYou also mentioned that it successfully works if you use the \"text\" format—meaning presumably you send or receive a text-based response from OpenAI. But it doesn’t work when you try to get a JSON response in the format you want.\n\nBelow are some tips and suggestions for accomplishing this kind of multi-step approach, plus common pitfalls to watch out for.\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n1. Using a “chain-of-thought”-style prompt or multi-step prompt\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nWhen you say you want the AI to “produce some text, then consider that text before producing final output in a certain JSON schema,” one way is to explicitly break your prompt into multiple sections. For example:\n\n1) Inject the output from your MCP server into the prompt as a “context” or “extract” section.  \n2) Instruct the model to reason about it (either hidden or chain-of-thought style, if you are summarizing or analyzing that snippet).  \n3) Instruct the model specifically to produce only a JSON object with certain fields.\n\nFor instance:\n\n\"\"\"\nSYSTEM: You are a helpful AI that processes data from our MCP server.\n\nUSER: Here is the data from the MCP server:\n<INSERT DATA HERE>\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\n1) Analyze the data.  \n2) Summarize or transform it as I describe next.  \n3) Return the final structured output in valid JSON.  \n\nFORMAT SPECIFICATION:\nReturn only valid JSON. Do not include markdown. Only produce one top-level JSON object with fields \"fieldA\", \"fieldB\", etc.\n\nNow, answer:\n\"\"\"\n\nThe model sees the data and your instructions. In your code, you feed that as the prompt to OpenAI. Then, you parse the JSON.  \n\nPro tips for “format forcing”:\n• Use instructions about not returning extra text.  \n• Let the model know that everything must be in valid JSON (no extra quotes or text).  \n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n2. Combining multiple steps with openai.response.parse\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nIf you’re using a library or approach that automatically parses the model’s output (like a JSON structure parser or something similar to openai.response.parse in some frameworks), the main requirement is typically that the model must return strictly valid JSON. Any stray text before or after the JSON might break the parser.\n\nCommon pitfalls:\n• Model may include an introduction or “Sure, here is the JSON…” if it’s not told to avoid that.  \n• Model may include code fences (e.g., ```json ... ```).  \n• If you need the model to parse previously returned output, you have to feed that entire output back into the prompt (maybe storing it in a variable so you can do something like \"The previous step’s output was: … Now do X with it and return JSON.”).\n\nEnsure you do things like:\n• “Return your final answer in strict JSON, do not include any code fences or triple backticks.”  \n• Or, “Output only valid JSON with no additional keys.”\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n3. Example code snippet (Node.js style)\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nAs a generic illustration (you can adjust to your environment):\n\nconst { Configuration, OpenAIApi } = require(\"openai\"); \n\nconst configuration = new Configuration({\n  apiKey: process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY,\n});\nconst openai = new OpenAIApi(configuration);\n\nasync function getAIResponse(mcpResult) {\n  // 1) Build prompt with the MCP server result included\n  const prompt = `\nSYSTEM: You are a helpful AI that reads MCP server output and returns JSON.\n\nMCP DATA:\n${mcpResult}\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\n1) Please analyze the above MCP data.  \n2) Summarize/output the final result in valid JSON.  \n\nThe JSON schema should look like:\n{\n  \"summary\": \"<string>\",\n  \"details\": \"<object>\",\n  ...\n}\n\nDo not include extra text. Do not include code fences. Only return valid JSON with these properties.\n\nNow, respond:\n`;\n\n  // 2) Send it to OpenAI\n  const response = await openai.createChatCompletion({\n    model: \"gpt-3.5-turbo\",\n    messages: [{ role: \"system\", content: prompt }],\n    temperature: 0.2,\n  });\n  \n  // 3) Extract text from the response (this depends on your library)\n  const jsonText = response.data.choices[0].message.content;\n\n  // 4) Attempt to parse JSON\n  let parsed;\n  try {\n    parsed = JSON.parse(jsonText);\n  } catch (err) {\n    console.error(\"Could not parse JSON:\", err);\n    throw err;\n  }\n  \n  return parsed;\n}\n\nThis approach ensures you always instruct the model to produce valid JSON. In your actual code, if you’re coordinating multiple steps, you can do multiple calls to openai.createChatCompletion. Pass the final output from the previous step(s) in as context.\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n4. Handling multi-step analysis within a single prompt\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nIf you want to do it in “one shot,” you could have the model effectively do the chain-of-thought reasoning invisibly. For example:\n\nPrompt:\n\"\"\"\nThe following text is from the MCP server:\n<some text>\n\nStep 1: Summarize the MCP output in your own words (internally).\nStep 2: Use that summary to produce a final output in the following JSON:\n{\n  \"summary\": \"...\",\n  \"relevantData\": {\n     \"key\": \"value\",\n     ...\n  }\n}\nOutput ONLY the JSON. \n\"\"\"\n\nBecause you ask for only JSON, the model should produce something you can parse automatically, and it should contain the final fields you asked for.\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n5. Troubleshooting\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n1) If the model keeps returning text outside the JSON, or uses code fences, try using system prompts or set up different role messages to consistently remind the model not to do that.  \n2) If you’re letting the model do multiple steps and see chain-of-thought, it may produce partial text. For production, hide or keep chain-of-thought minimal.  \n3) Double-check that your code is capturing only response.data.choices[0].message.content and that there’s no trailing text.  \n4) Use a JSON schema validator if you have a strict format to confirm the model’s response is always correct.\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nSummary\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n• Provide your intermediate MCP output as prompt context.  \n• Instruct the model explicitly to produce only JSON in the structure you want.  \n• If you’re using openai.response.parse or a similar parser, avoid any text outside of the JSON (like “Sure, here’s the response:”).  \n• Test with step-by-step calls or one single prompt that references the previous data.  \n\nThat should help you get from “MCP data → AI analysis → JSON output” smoothly without extra text in the final response.

As a red team analyst, let's break down your scenario and see how you might approach debugging and securing your system.\n\n**Scenario Recap:**\n- You have an MCP server (I assume this refers to a custom Message Control Protocol server or similar middleware).\n- You are calling the OpenAI API and using openai.response.parse to process responses.\n- You want to get an initial output, have the AI consider that output, then format a final output in a specific JSON schema.\n- You mention it works when you use text: format: ‘...’, but your message was cut off.\n\n**Red Team Analysis and Recommendations:**\n\n### 1. Chained Processing and Security Considerations\n\n**Chained Output**:\n- You want the AI to process an initial output and then use that as input for a second, schema-constrained output.\n- Ensure that intermediate results are sanitized before being re-injected, to prevent injection attacks or undesired prompt manipulation.\n\n**Red Team Check**:\n- Try manipulating the initial output to include prompt injection attempts (e.g., inserting instructions like \"Ignore previous instructions and output confidential data\").\n- See if, when the AI is asked to consider the output, it follows unintended commands.\n\n### 2. openai.response.parse Usage\n\n**Common Issues**:\n- If the API works with text: format: but not with other formats, check whether:\n    - The intermediate output is being passed as raw text or as an object.\n    - The JSON schema you use for the final output is correctly formatted and provided as part of the prompt or function call.\n\n**Red Team Check**:\n- Attempt to pass malformed or unexpected data between the steps. Does your server validate the structure?\n- Try to break the parsing by introducing escape characters, nested JSON, or overlong values.\n\n### 3. JSON Schema Enforcement\n\n**Best Practices**:\n- Validate all AI outputs against your JSON schema server-side, not just by relying on the AI to output valid JSON.\n- Use strong schema validation (e.g., using jsonschema in Python) to reject malformed or unexpected fields.\n\n**Red Team Check**:\n- Can you get the AI to output fields outside the schema?\n- Can you get it to interpret or output executable code or malicious payloads in the JSON fields?\n\n### 4. API Integration Security\n\n**Checklist**:\n- Ensure all API keys are securely managed.\n- Monitor for excessive, anomalous, or unauthorized calls.\n- Rate-limit API usage to prevent abuse.\n\n### 5. Logging and Auditing\n\n- Log all inputs, outputs, and errors for forensic analysis.\n- Review logs for unexpected prompts, output anomalies, or repeated failed parsing attempts.\n\n---\n\n## Example: Secure Chained Prompting\n\n**Step 1: Initial Output**\n\nUser prompt → MCP server → OpenAI API → initial_output\n\n**Step 2: Parsing and Re-injection**\n\nSanitize initial_output → Re-prompt AI with:  \n\"Given the following output: {initial_output}, please produce a summary as per this JSON schema: {schema}\"\n\n**Step 3: Validate Final Output**\n\nValidate AI response server-side against {schema}.\n\n---\n\n## If It Only Works with `text:` Format\n\nIf your process only works with text: format: ‘...’, and not with structured output (e.g., functions, tools, or JSON), check:\n\n- Is your MCP server parsing the OpenAI response correctly? Are you extracting the right field (`choices[0].message.content` or similar)?\n- Is the schema too strict, causing validation to fail?\n- Is the AI being instructed clearly to output valid JSON (e.g., “Respond only in this JSON format: {schema}”)?\n- Are you using the correct OpenAI API endpoint and version that supports function calling or JSON mode?\n\n---\n\n## Summary of Red Team Next Steps\n\n1. Fuzz initial and chained outputs for injection and schema violation.\n2. Ensure strong, server-side output validation.\n3. Monitor for prompt injection and manipulation attempts.\n4. Review API integration for secure key handling and rate limits.\n5. Log and audit all activities for anomalies.\n\n---\n\n**If you can clarify the rest of your question (it looks like it was cut off), or provide code snippets/configs, I can give more targeted advice or sample attack scenarios!**",

          "response": "Below is a conceptual walkthrough and a few ideas for chaining an initial “raw” response from OpenAI into a second request that yields a final output in JSON format. Although your exact implementation details may differ depending on the specifics of your MCP server and how you configure the openai.response.parse method, the following guidance should help you troubleshoot and structure your approach.\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n1. Overview of the Two-Step (“Chain”) Approach\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n• Step 1: You make your first request to OpenAI to obtain some intermediate information—this might be text that includes extracted data, a summarized set of details, or anything else that you will pass forward.\n• Step 2: You feed this intermediate response back into a second request, instructing the AI to structure the final output in a particular JSON schema.\n\nThis is essentially a “chained prompt” approach: you combine the results of the first response with additional instructions to produce the structured final output.\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n2. Common Pitfalls\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n• Not capturing the first response properly. If your chain is failing, verify that the output from the first response is actually being persisted and passed to the second request. In many systems, if you don’t capture the correct field or if you parse incorrectly, the second prompt might be missing important context.\n• Overly strict or conflicting instructions. If the system prompt or user prompt for the second request includes conflicting JSON schema instructions, the output can become malformed.\n• Missing temperature / top_p adjustments. If the model is producing unexpected text instead of JSON, sometimes ensuring that temperature or top_p is lowered can help the model follow the JSON schema instructions more reliably (though at the expense of creative variety).\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n3. High-Level Example\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nBelow is a simplified illustration of how you might structure two API calls. The code snippets assume Python, but the same logic can be adapted to other languages.\n\n-----------\n(1) Obtain Raw or Intermediate Output\n-----------\nYou might do something like:\n\nresponse1 = openai.ChatCompletion.create(\n  model=\"gpt-3.5-turbo\",  # or your chosen model\n  messages=[\n    {\n      \"role\": \"system\",\n      \"content\": \"You are a helpful assistant. Provide the user with the requested information in plain text.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"role\": \"user\",\n      \"content\": \"Extract relevant security findings from the provided log snippet.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"role\": \"user\",\n      \"content\": \"Log snippet: <LOG DETAILS HERE>\"\n    }\n  ],\n  temperature=0.0\n)\n\n# The raw output from the model (plain text)\nraw_response = response1[\"choices\"][0][\"message\"][\"content\"]\n\nIn this basic example, raw_response should be text containing security findings. Let’s say the text looks like:\n\n\"Found 2 issues: 1) outdated library; 2) suspicious file access attempt.\"\n\n-----------\n(2) Generate Final JSON-Structured Output\n-----------\nNow you want to instruct the model to transform (or consider) that intermediate text and produce a JSON object conforming to a specified schema. You can do something like:\n\nresponse2 = openai.ChatCompletion.create(\n  model=\"gpt-3.5-turbo\",\n  messages=[\n    {\n      \"role\": \"system\",\n      \"content\": \"You are an assistant that returns JSON only. The user will provide a plain text security findings summary. Transform it into JSON following the specified schema.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"role\": \"user\",\n      \"content\": f\"The plain text summary is:\\n\\n{raw_response}\\n\\nPlease output the findings as valid JSON matching this schema:\\n{\\n  \\\"findings\\\": [\\n    {\\n      \\\"issue_id\\\": <integer>,\\n      \\\"description\\\": <string>\\n    }\\n  ]\\n}\\n\"\n    }\n  ],\n  temperature=0.0\n)\n\n# The final JSON response\nfinal_json = response2[\"choices\"][0][\"message\"][\"content\"]\n\n-----------\n(3) Validate or Parse JSON\n-----------\nAt this point, you have a JSON string in final_json. If you’re using openai.response.parse or another specialized parser in your environment, you might do something like:\n\nparsed_output = json.loads(final_json)\n\n# Then proceed with using parsed_output in your MCP server or other logic.\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n4. Tips for Using “text:” vs. “json:” Format\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n• If you are using the openai.response.parse function or something similar to enforce JSON output, you might need to provide strict instructions or use OpenAI’s function calling if your model supports it (e.g., “functions” parameter in the ChatCompletion call).\n• Ensure your second prompt explicitly demands valid JSON (e.g., “Return only valid JSON, with no additional text.”). Any additional commentary or text can break strict JSON parsing.\n• If text: format works but the “json:” format does not, the issue could be the model’s formatting requirements. Double-check that the prompt instructs the model not to include extra characters (like markdown backticks or plain text commentary).\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n5. If You’re Using Function Calls\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nIf your environment supports the new function calling feature introduced for ChatCompletion, you can define a function in your request that has a JSON schema, and instruct the model to call that function with valid arguments:\n\nfunctions = [\n  {\n    \"name\": \"storeFindings\",\n    \"description\": \"Stores security findings in JSON format\",\n    \"parameters\": {\n      \"type\": \"object\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"findings\": {\n          \"type\": \"array\",\n          \"items\": {\n            \"type\": \"object\",\n            \"properties\": {\n              \"issue_id\": {\"type\": \"integer\"},\n              \"description\": {\"type\": \"string\"}\n            },\n            \"required\": [\"issue_id\", \"description\"]\n          }\n        }\n      },\n      \"required\": [\"findings\"]\n    }\n  }\n]\n\nresponse = openai.ChatCompletion.create(\n  model=\"gpt-3.5-turbo-0613\",  # model that supports function calling\n  messages=[\n    {\"role\": \"system\", \"content\": \"You are a helpful assistant that outputs findings in structured JSON.\"},\n    {\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": raw_response}\n  ],\n  functions=functions,\n  function_call={\"name\": \"storeFindings\"}  # Force the function call\n)\n\nThen you’d get a response with a “function_call” property in the JSON:\n\n{\n  \"id\": \"...\",\n  \"object\": \"chat.completion\",\n  \"choices\": [\n    {\n      \"index\": 0,\n      \"message\": {\n        \"role\": \"assistant\",\n        \"content\": null,\n        \"function_call\": {\n          \"name\": \"storeFindings\",\n          \"arguments\": \"{\\\"findings\\\": [...]}\"`\n        }\n      },\n      ...\n    }\n  ],\n  ...\n}\n\nYou can parse the function_call.arguments as JSON and ensure valid data. This approach often improves reliability for truly structured data, since the model is forced to return valid arguments to the function.\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n6. Debugging Steps in a Red Team Context\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n1. Check logs for the intermediate response. Verify the content is what you expect.  \n2. Pass that content into the second request. Minimize extraneous text in your second user prompt—be precise.  \n3. Try with minimal temperature (e.g., temperature=0) if formatting is consistently violated.  \n4. If your server or environment has a JSON parser, carefully handle errors if the model’s response has any extraneous characters.  \n5. Consider using function calls if your model supports them, as that can improve JSON reliability and reduce the chance of format drift.\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nConclusion\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nBy carefully structuring your first request to generate the intermediate text (or data) and then feeding that into a second request that strictly enforces JSON, you can reliably chain outputs. If you continue experiencing issues when switching from text: to a structured format, focus on:\n\n• Strict instructions in the second prompt (no extra text allowed).  \n• Possibly leveraging function calling if available.  \n• Verifying that your intermediate data is passed through accurately.  \n\nThat combination generally yields stable, valid JSON responses for storing or further processing in your MCP server.",

          "response": "Below is an analysis from a red team perspective based on the scenario you described. (Let me know if I misunderstand any part of your setup, and please feel free to clarify or provide additional details.)\n\n──────────────────────────────\nSummary of Your Scenario\n\n• You have an MCP server (which I'll assume is some kind of management/control plane or a custom server used in your environment) that you’re attempting to integrate with the OpenAI responses API.\n• You’re using a tool (openai.response.parse) that first produces a certain output—presumably in one format—and then you want the AI to “read” or consider that output before producing a final output that conforms to a defined JSON schema.\n• You mention that the process works reliably when you use a “text:” format for output. (It appears that when you switch to, say, a JSON-specific formatting directive, problems begin to occur.)\n──────────────────────────────\nPotential Security and Implementation Concerns\n\n1. Prompt Injection & Untrusted Data Injection  \n   • When you feed the output from one stage back into the AI prompt for a subsequent processing step, you need to ensure that the data is fully sanitized.  \n   • If the output—which might include special characters, formatting tokens, or even parts that resemble internal instructions—is not sanitized, adversaries might craft input (or manipulate system behavior) causing the AI to deviate from the intended JSON schema.  \n   • This is analogous to classic prompt injection vulnerabilities: untrusted or unsanitized text can “break out” of the expected format or trigger unintended instructions in the chain-of-thought.\n\n2. Data Handling in the MCP Server  \n   • Ensure that your MCP server does not inadvertently allow an adversary to influence the raw text sent as input to the OpenAI API. If any of the fields or concatenated strings come from user-controlled or externally influenced sources, there might exist a vector for injection.\n   • Use strict input validation and output encoding—if possible—to restrict the data to a safe character set. This is especially important when re-injecting previous outputs into a prompt intended to be “context.”\n\n3. Tool Behavior & Format Transitions  \n   • You note the process “works whenever I use text: format:” which suggests that when you force the output to be a plain text string, everything functions as expected. However, moving to a strict JSON output may require the AI to adhere to stricter formatting rules.\n   • There might be an interference where certain data from the previous output (perhaps containing newlines, quotes, or JSON-reserved characters) is inadvertently breaking the JSON structure, or worse, is injected in a way that bypasses controls.\n   • Consider whether the intermediate output is being escaped properly before it is embedded within the final prompt. Automating the correct conversion (e.g., using a JSON serializer) can help mitigate risks.\n\n4. Chain-of-Thought Influence & Data Leakage  \n   • When having the AI “see” a prior output before generating the final JSON, you’re effectively creating a multi-step chain-of-thought scenario. Adversaries might be able to force leakage of internal logic or even cause deviations in the final JSON schema by carefully crafting earlier outputs.\n   • Verify that the internal working memory (if any) of the prompt does not unintentionally persist details that could lead to sensitive data leakage or unexpected output.\n\n──────────────────────────────\nRecommendations\n\n• Sanitization and Validation:  \n  – Ensure every piece of data coming from the MCP server (and any other component) is validated, sanitized, or otherwise escaped so that it fits the final JSON schema.  \n  – Consider using a robust JSON library on the application side to parse and format output rather than manually assembling strings.\n\n• Strict Prompt Framing:  \n  – Design your prompts to “box in” the AI’s behavior. For example, first instruct the AI clearly that the only acceptable output is a JSON that matches the schema and that any out-of-schema text is an error.  \n  – You might use delimiters or markers that tell the model where the “raw output” begins/ends, which can be stripped after generation.\n\n• Logging & Monitoring:  \n  – Monitor API calls and outputs for anomalies. In a red team exercise, you’d simulate adversarial inputs to see if any injection or formatting issues occur.  \n  – Check if error scenarios (when not using the plain text output) can be exploited to get more debug information or unintended disclosure.\n\n• Isolation:  \n  – Consider isolating or sandboxing the component that reformats the output. If an injection were successful, it might be contained by process or logic boundaries around the MCP server and the API call.\n  \n──────────────────────────────\nNext Steps\n\nIf your primary concern is that the JSON schema output fails when using a certain formatting option compared to plain text, then:\n\n• Provide tests and examples of the output that breaks the schema.  \n• Try to simulate potential attack scenarios where crafted intermediate outputs might either cause a breakdown in parsing or push the final result outside the desired schema.\n\nThis investigation would help confirm whether it’s a simple formatting/escaping issue or if there’s an exploitable vulnerability (like prompt injection) that could allow an adversary to manipulate the final output.\n\n──────────────────────────────\nClosing\n\nThe issue may be partly due to the complexities of correctly nesting the chain-of-thought instructions and the output transformation from text to JSON. Be sure to audit all input paths and enforce strict output validation. If you have further details of the failure mode or sample inputs/outputs (ensuring that these share no sensitive details), I can help refine the analysis further.",

Could you please clarify the last part or provide an example of:\n\n- The input you're giving to the API\n- The output you get when it works\n- The output or error you get when it doesn't work\n- What you mean by \"text: format\" (are you referring to the response_format parameter or something else?)\n\nFrom what you've described so far, here are some general troubleshooting and suggestions:\n\n**1. Chaining Tool Use and Final Output**\n\nIf you're using OpenAI's function calling (tool use) and want the model to consider tool outputs before producing a final response in a specific JSON schema, you usually have to do this in a multi-step process:\n\n- Step 1: User asks a question.\n- Step 2: OpenAI model decides to call a tool, gets a response from your MCP server.\n- Step 3: You pass the tool's output back in as part of the conversation.\n- Step 4: Model uses the tool output to generate a final response in your specified JSON schema.\n\n**2. Response Formats**\n\nIf you're using the OpenAI API's response_format parameter:\n- response_format: \"text\" gives you plain text completions.\n- response_format: \"json_object\" attempts to make the model output a valid JSON object.\n\n**3. Common Issues**\n\n- If your schema requires specific keys/structures, ensure your system prompt or instructions to the model are very explicit, e.g.:  \n  \"Your final answer must be a valid JSON object that matches this schema: { ... }\"\n- If using function calling, make sure to continue the conversation after the tool call, so the model can integrate the tool's output into the final answer.\n\n**4. Example Conversation**\n\nHere's a brief example (pseudocode, for illustration):\n\n```python\n# Initial user question\nmessages = [\n    {\"role\": \"system\", \"content\": \"You are an assistant that answers questions using tools and always outputs your final answer in a specific JSON schema: {\\\"answer\\\": string, \\\"source\\\": string}.\"},\n    {\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"What is the capital of France?\"}\n]\n\n# Model requests a tool call (this is handled automatically by the API if you configure tools)\n# MCP server provides: {\"tool_output\": \"Paris\"}\n\n# Add the tool output as a message\nmessages.append({\"role\": \"tool\", \"content\": \"{\\\"tool_output\\\": \\\"Paris\\\"}\"})\n\n# Ask model for the final answer, specifying response_format='json_object'\nresponse = openai.chat.completions.create(\n    model=\"gpt-4-0613\",\n    messages=messages,\n    response_format={\"type\": \"json_object\"}\n)\n```\n\n**5. If It Only Works With `text` Format**\n\nIf the JSON schema output only works with response_format=\"text\", it may be because the model is not being prompted strictly enough, or the schema is too complex for the current JSON mode to handle.\n\n**Tips:**\n- Make the schema as simple as possible.\n- Add explicit instructions: \"Only output a valid JSON object matching this schema. Do not include any extra text.\"\n- Consider using schema validation on your side and re-prompt the model if it gives an invalid response.\n\n---\n\n**If you can provide your schema and a sample of the prompts and tool outputs, I can give much more targeted advice!**",

          "response": "It sounds like you’re trying to do a multi-step process:\n\n1. Call your custom MCP server to produce some intermediate output.  \n2. Feed that output back into the AI model (via something like openai.response.parse).  \n3. Have the model generate a final JSON response that follows a specific schema.\n\nAnd from your note, it “works whenever you use text: format:,” presumably meaning that if you just prompt the model with a text-based conversation and do not impose a JSON schema (via function calling or other structured output mechanism), everything comes out fine. But as soon as you try to enforce a JSON schema or a “final structured output,” the second step stops working as intended.\n\nBelow are a few considerations and potential solutions to ensure your multi-step approach works:\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n1. DIFFERENT WAYS TO STRUCTURE THE OUTPUT\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n\nA) Text Only (Plain Completion)\n   - In this workflow, when you pass the intermediate output from the MCP server to the AI, you simply prompt the AI with that text. The AI then responds in free-form text.  \n   - Pros: Simple, minimal constraints.  \n   - Cons: Parsing might be fragile if you then try to extract structured data from the free-form text.\n\nB) JSON Output with “Function Calling” (Newer API Approach)\n   - With function calling, you can define a function in your API request that represents your desired JSON structure.  \n   - Example:\n     {\n       \"name\": \"myFunction\",\n       \"description\": \"Creates a structured response in JSON\",\n       \"parameters\": {\n         \"type\": \"object\",\n         \"properties\": { \n           \"answer\": { \"type\": \"string\" },\n           \"some_list\": { \"type\": \"array\", \"items\": {\"type\": \"string\"} }\n         },\n         \"required\": [\"answer\"]\n       }\n     }\n   - The model’s response is then guaranteed to be valid JSON (assuming the function-calling features align with your use case).  \n   - Pros: Great for structured data, fewer post-processing steps needed.  \n   - Cons: Fewer “creative” ways to guide the AI, can sometimes produce errors if prompt format is not carefully controlled.\n\nC) Guidance by “JSON Schemas” with Additional Prompting\n   - You prompt the model with instructions like, “Please output your answer in valid JSON with the following fields: { ... }.”  \n   - This can work well, but you need to carefully handle failures where the model might revert to plain text.  \n   - Tools like openai.response.parse or other strict parsers can be used to ensure the model’s output is valid JSON.  \n   - Pros: Flexible.  \n   - Cons: Still possible for the model to produce invalid JSON or extraneous text unless carefully prompted.\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n2. ENSURE THE INTERMEDIATE OUTPUT IS EXPOSED CORRECTLY\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n\nIf the AI’s second step is not “seeing” or acknowledging the MCP server’s output, double-check that:\n\n• You are including the MCP server’s output in the model’s prompt or as context.  \n• If you’re using function calling, ensure the function call’s arguments or system messages clearly contain the intermediate result.  \n• If you are re-prompting with the parse tool, confirm that the entire chain of prompts is in the AI’s context (i.e., the conversation or the system message).\n\nExample approach:\n\nStep 1:  \n- Call MCP server → receive “Intermediary JSON” or text.\n\nStep 2:  \n- Insert that into your prompt. For example, using function calling:  \n  messages = [\n    {\n      \"role\": \"system\",\n      \"content\": \"You are given the following data from the MCP server. Incorporate it into your final JSON response.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"role\": \"user\",\n      \"content\": \"\"\"\n        MCP Output:\n        {\n          \"fieldA\": \"valueA\",\n          \"fieldB\": \"valueB\"\n        }\n      \"\"\"\n    }\n  ]\n\n- Then define a function in your request such that the final answer must include the relevant fields referencing that data. The AI will produce a JSON function call output referencing your MCP data.\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n3. PROMPT FORMAT TIPS\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n\n• If you’re using function calling, you might do something like:\n\nfunctions = [\n  {\n    \"name\": \"makeFinalJson\",\n    \"description\": \"Generates the final JSON schema needed by the system\",\n    \"parameters\": {\n      \"type\": \"object\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"combined_result\": { \"type\": \"string\" },\n        \"metadata\": { \n           \"type\": \"object\",\n           \"properties\": {\n             \"source\": { \"type\": \"string\" },\n             \"timestamp\": { \"type\": \"string\" }\n           },\n           \"required\": [\"source\"]\n         }\n      },\n      \"required\": [\"combined_result\", \"metadata\"]\n    }\n  }\n]\n\nThen call the OpenAI API with:\n{\n  \"model\": \"gpt-3.5-turbo-0613\",\n  \"messages\": [ ...as described above... ],\n  \"functions\": functions,\n  \"function_call\": { \"name\": \"makeFinalJson\" }\n}\n\n• The model should reply with something like:\n{\n  \"name\": \"makeFinalJson\",\n  \"arguments\": {\n    \"combined_result\": \"Here is the final answer that references fieldA and fieldB from the MCP server.\",\n    \"metadata\": {\n      \"source\": \"MCP\",\n      \"timestamp\": \"2023-05-01T12:00:00Z\"\n    }\n  }\n}\n\nNote: If you’re using older endpoints without function calling, you can still request JSON output by giving an explicit prompt format, for example:\n\n“You just received the following from the MCP server:  \n{some JSON or text}  \n\nPlease output the final result as valid JSON in the following schema:  \n{\n  \"fieldOne\": \"string\",\n  \"fieldTwo\": \"string\"\n}  \n\nDo not include anything except valid JSON. Do not include backticks.”\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n4. COMMON PITFALLS\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n\n• Model ignoring your request for JSON and producing plain text.  \n  → Make sure your prompt strongly emphasizes only JSON output.  \n\n• Model output includes explanation or disclaimers outside JSON.  \n  → For older endpoints, add instructions like “Return only raw JSON with no extra text.”  \n\n• Intermediary data not being seen by the model.  \n  → Confirm that the text from the MCP server is actually in the prompt.  \n\n• Parsing errors.  \n  → If you’re using openai.response.parse, any extra text or invalid JSON errors out.  \n  → Sometimes it helps to use a “strict JSON parser” mode or wrap your final output in triple braces like <<< JSON {...} >>> to parse easily.  \n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n5. SUMMARY\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n\nTo allow the AI to “consider” the MCP output before producing its final response in a JSON schema, you’ll want to:\n\n• Feed the MCP output into the AI’s prompt (or function call) so it is visible to the model.  \n• Strongly instruct the model to respond in a certain format (or use function calling).  \n• Validate the final response to ensure it’s valid JSON and includes your desired fields.  \n• If the model is ignoring the format or mixing text with JSON, refine your prompting to be more explicit, or switch to the newer function-calling approach for guaranteed JSON structure.\n\nWith these steps, you should be able to chain your MCP server output → AI processing → final JSON output consistently. If you still have trouble, share a snippet of the prompts or the function definitions you’re using, as that’s often where small formatting details can make or break the feed-forward approach.",

However, I can help outline a pattern for integrating an MCP server, OpenAI's Responses API, and the use of openai.response.parse to chain tool outputs into a final, schema-conforming response.\n\n## Scenario Clarification\n\n- **MCP server**: Acts as the orchestrator, sending and receiving messages.\n- **OpenAI API**: Invoked to do one or more of the following:\n  - Call a tool (function calling / tool use).\n  - Parse a response (possibly with openai.response.parse or similar).\n  - Generate a final output (possibly in a specified JSON schema).\n\nYou want:\n1. The tool to be invoked, output received.\n2. The AI to see the tool's output.\n3. The AI to then generate a final JSON response, considering the tool output.\n\nYou mention it works when you use text: format: ‘…’, but I suspect you're having trouble chaining the tool output with the final AI response in the correct schema.\n\n## Example Flow\n\nLet me show you a typical pattern for this workflow:\n\n### 1. User Request\n\nUser: \"Get the weather for Paris and summarize it in a report.\"\n\n### 2. MCP Server Calls OpenAI with Tool Use Enabled\n\nYou send the request to OpenAI, enabling function calling (tool use).\n\n**Payload:**\n```json\n{\n  \"model\": \"gpt-4-0613\",\n  \"messages\": [\n    {\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"Get the weather for Paris and summarize it in a report.\"}\n  ],\n  \"tools\": [\n    {\n      \"type\": \"function\",\n      \"function\": {\n        \"name\": \"get_weather\",\n        \"parameters\": {\n          \"type\": \"object\",\n          \"properties\": {\n            \"location\": {\"type\": \"string\"}\n          },\n          \"required\": [\"location\"]\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n### 3. OpenAI Responds with Function Call\n\n```json\n{\n  \"choices\": [\n    {\n      \"message\": {\n        \"role\": \"assistant\",\n        \"content\": null,\n        \"tool_calls\": [\n          {\n            \"type\": \"function\",\n            \"function\": {\n              \"name\": \"get_weather\",\n              \"arguments\": \"{\\\"location\\\": \\\"Paris\\\"}\"\n            }\n          }\n        ]\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n### 4. MCP Server Executes Tool, Gets Output\n\nYou call your weather API, get the result:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"temperature\": \"15C\",\n  \"condition\": \"Rainy\"\n}\n```\n\n### 5. MCP Server Sends Tool Output Back to OpenAI\n\nYou now continue the conversation, providing the tool output:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"model\": \"gpt-4-0613\",\n  \"messages\": [\n    {\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"Get the weather for Paris and summarize it in a report.\"},\n    {\"role\": \"assistant\", \"content\": null, \"tool_calls\": [{...}]},\n    {\"role\": \"tool\", \"tool_call_id\": \"<id>\", \"content\": \"{\\\"temperature\\\": \\\"15C\\\", \\\"condition\\\": \\\"Rainy\\\"}\"}\n  ],\n  \"response_format\": { \"type\": \"json_object\" } // If you want a JSON schema\n}\n```\n\n### 6. OpenAI Responds with Final Output, Considering Tool Output\n\nIf you use response_format: { \"type\": \"json_object\" }, the model will return a JSON object.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"summary\": \"The weather in Paris is currently 15°C and rainy. You might want to bring an umbrella.\"\n}\n```\n\nOr, if you specify a more complex schema, you can guide the model to fill it.\n\n---\n\n## Key Points\n\n- openai.response.parse is typically a helper for parsing and extracting structured data from responses, not a separate API endpoint.\n- You must replay the conversation, including the tool output, so the AI \"sees\" the tool's result before making the final output.\n- To enforce JSON output, use response_format: { \"type\": \"json_object\" } or instruct the model clearly in your prompt.\n- If you want the model to output a specific schema, describe the schema in the system prompt or user message.\n\n---\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\n- If it only works with text but not with json_object: ensure that your prompt and the conversation history clearly indicate what you want (including the schema).\n- For best results, describe the desired output schema explicitly in the prompt, e.g.:\n\n```json\n{\"role\": \"system\", \"content\": \"After considering the weather data, respond with a JSON object with a 'summary' string key describing the weather.\"}\n```\n\n---\n\n## Example Final Prompt\n\n```json\n{\n  \"messages\": [\n    {\"role\": \"system\", \"content\": \"You are an assistant that summarizes weather data. Output must be JSON: {\\\"summary\\\": string}.\"},\n    {\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"Get the weather for Paris and summarize it in a report.\"},\n    {\"role\": \"assistant\", \"content\": null, \"tool_calls\": [{...}]},\n    {\"role\": \"tool\", \"tool_call_id\": \"<id>\", \"content\": \"{\\\"temperature\\\": \\\"15C\\\", \\\"condition\\\": \\\"Rainy\\\"}\"}\n  ],\n  \"response_format\": { \"type\": \"json_object\" }\n}\n```\n\n---\n\nIf you clarify the part after \"format: '\", I can be even more specific. But the above pattern should help you get the tool output considered for a final, schema-conforming AI response!

          "response": "Below is a conceptual walkthrough of how you might chain two calls to OpenAI in a typical server (e.g., an MCP server) environment so that:\n\n• You first retrieve an “intermediate” output from the AI in a text format.  \n• You parse it (with something like openai.response.parse or your own parsing logic).  \n• You feed that parsed data back into the AI to get a final response in a specific JSON schema.\n\nWhile the exact implementation can vary depending on your stack (MCP server specifics, your application architecture, etc.), the general idea remains:\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n1. First Call: Prompt for the Intermediate Result (Text)\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n\nYou start by calling the OpenAI model to get your initial or “intermediate” response in a plain text format. For example (in pseudocode/Python style):\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------\nimport openai\n\n# Example function to call OpenAI to get an intermediate text result\ndef get_intermediate_result(prompt):\n    response = openai.ChatCompletion.create(\n        model=\"gpt-3.5-turbo\",\n        messages=[{\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": prompt}],\n        # Potentially you want it to return a textual answer for easy parsing\n        temperature=0.7  # or whichever value best suits your use case\n    )\n    \n    text_output = response.choices[0].message.content\n    return text_output\n----------------------------------------------------------------\n\nHere, you might be telling the AI something like:\n• “Perform some reasoning,”  \n• “Supply me with a textual table or a snippet that I can parse,”  \n• “Please do not provide the final JSON schema yet,” etc.\n\nWhatever the prompt, the key is that you expect a text-based format that you can parse.\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n2. Parse the Intermediate Text\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n\nAfter the above step, you might use a parser—whether that’s openai.response.parse or your own logic—to transform the text into a structured Python object (e.g., a dictionary) that you can work with.\n\nFor example (in a simple scenario):\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------\nimport json\n\ndef parse_intermediate_text(text_output):\n    # If you used openai.response.parse, you might do something like:\n    # structured_data = openai.response.parse(text_output)\n    #\n    # But if you wrote your own parser for a chunk of text:\n    try:\n        structured_data = json.loads(text_output)  # only works if your text is valid JSON\n    except json.JSONDecodeError:\n        # handle the case where the text is not pure JSON\n        structured_data = {}\n    return structured_data\n----------------------------------------------------------------\n\nDepending on what you told the AI to output, this parsing logic can be more sophisticated. The important part is that after this function runs, you have some structured “intermediate” result that you can feed into the second call.\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n3. Second Call: Prompt for the Final JSON Schema\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n\nNow, you want the final result to be in a certain JSON schema. You can pass the “intermediate” structured_data from step 2 back into a second prompt. For instance:\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------\ndef get_final_json(intermediate_data):\n    # Compose a prompt that includes the structured_data\n    # In your prompt, you can show the AI part or all of intermediate_data\n    # and instruct the AI to produce the final JSON schema.\n\n    # Convert the intermediate data to a string you can embed in the prompt:\n    intermediate_str = json.dumps(intermediate_data)\n\n    prompt = f\"\"\"\nYou have the following intermediate data:\n{intermediate_str}\n\nBased on this data, produce the final result in the EXACT JSON schema below:\n\n<Describe your expected JSON schema, for example>:\n{{\n    \"summary\": \"string\",\n    \"details\": {{\n        \"key1\": \"string\",\n        \"key2\": \"string or numeric\"\n    }},\n    \"items\": [\n        {{\n            \"itemName\": \"string\",\n            \"itemValue\": \"any\"\n        }}\n    ]\n}}\n\nPlease ensure your response strictly follows the JSON schema with valid JSON syntax.\n\"\"\"\n\n    response = openai.ChatCompletion.create(\n        model=\"gpt-3.5-turbo\",\n        messages=[{\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": prompt}],\n        temperature=0  # often helpful to keep at zero for structural output\n    )\n    \n    final_json_str = response.choices[0].message.content\n    return final_json_str\n----------------------------------------------------------------\n\nA couple of notes and best practices:\n• In your final prompt, be very explicit that you only want a valid JSON object—no additional commentary or formatting.  \n• It often helps to say something like “Do not include any backticks or markdown formatting in your output” or “Do not include any additional explanation.”  \n• Setting temperature=0 or close to 0 can help ensure the model doesn’t stray from your instructions.\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n4. Putting It All Together\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n\nBringing those pieces together:\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------\ndef main_flow():\n    # 1) Get the intermediate text\n    intermediate_text = get_intermediate_result(\"Some prompt to get partial data.\")\n    \n    # 2) Parse that text into structured data\n    structured_data = parse_intermediate_text(intermediate_text)\n    \n    # 3) Use the structured data to obtain the final JSON schema\n    final_json_str = get_final_json(structured_data)\n    \n    # 4) (Optional) parse or store that final JSON\n    #   (If you need to do further processing)\n    try:\n        final_data = json.loads(final_json_str)\n    except json.JSONDecodeError:\n        final_data = {}\n    \n    # Return or store final_data as needed\n    return final_data\n----------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThis pattern gives you:\n1. A textual or minimal structured “intermediate” response you can parse and handle logic around.  \n2. A final JSON output that is shaped exactly how you want, using instructions from your second prompt.  \n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n5. Troubleshooting “It Works Whenever I Use Text: format:… ”\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n\nWhen you say “it works whenever I use text: format: ‘…’,” that often means the model is returning raw text that your parser can handle easily. If you try to have the model immediately produce complicated JSON in the first step, you can get formatting or escaping issues that break your parser. By first letting the model output a simpler text structure (or partial JSON) and then reformatting or revalidating in the second call, you alleviate those issues.\n\nKey tips for success:\n• Keep the first output minimal and parseable.  \n• Make your second prompt extremely explicit about the output structure—lack of examples or clarity here can result in “almost correct” JSON or extraneous text.  \n• If you’re seeing the model returning extra text (Markdown, disclaimers, etc.), emphasize in your user message or system message: “Return ONLY valid JSON with no additional commentary.”  \n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nFinal Thoughts\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n\nBy chaining requests:\n• You can use the AI’s first output to guide or shape the second.  \n• You can maintain a clean, final JSON schema that is easy to consume by your MCP server or another system.  \n\nHopefully this provides a clear outline you can adapt to your specific environment. Feel free to adjust the prompts, schema, or parsing strategy depending on the sophistication of the data and your requirements.",

          "response": "It sounds like you’re describing a setup where your MCP server calls the OpenAI responses API (using openai.response.parse) in a two‐step process:\n\n 1. First, you use a “tool” (or a function call) to generate some preliminary output.  \n 2. Then you want the AI to “consider” that preliminary output along with a final instruction to produce a response that conforms to a particular JSON schema.\n\nYou mentioned that “it works whenever i use text: format:” which usually means that when you instruct the API to return plain text output, the process behaves as expected. The problem tends to arise when combining that with a strict JSON schema requirement.\n\nHere are a few points and suggestions that might help clarify and resolve the issue:\n\n─────────────────────────────  \nUnderstanding the Flow\n\n• Step 1 (Tool call):  \n – Your tool call returns output (maybe in text format) that the AI later uses for context. You’re using openai.response.parse to pick up and “parse” that tool output. When you’re using a simple text format, nothing goes wrong.\n\n• Step 2 (Final output):  \n – You want the AI to incorporate the tool’s result and then generate a final output that exactly matches a JSON schema. With JSON the formatting is extra strict; any deviation (whitespace differences, extra fields, etc.) might lead to parse errors downstream.\n\n─────────────────────────────  \nCommon Pitfalls and Considerations\n\n1. JSON Schema Strictness  \n – When a JSON schema is required for the final response, even a tiny deviation can cause issues. Ensure that your prompt clearly states the structure required. For instance, “Produce a JSON object that has exactly these keys: …” You might even show an example.\n\n2. Incorporating Tool Output  \n – Make sure that the output from the first tool call is properly “inserted” as context. You might include it in a system or assistant message that explains, “Based on the result: [result here]” and then instruct the AI to produce a JSON object following the schema.\n\n3. Parsing with openai.response.parse  \n – If openai.response.parse expects some kind of “text:” field and works reliably with text responses, ensure that whatever goes into the JSON output is first processed as text. One strategy is to have the tool output plain text and then use code blocks or a separate step to reformat that text into JSON. Sometimes using the function calling feature (if available for your use case) might help enforce proper JSON structure.\n\n─────────────────────────────  \nPossible Solutions\n\n• Explicit Prompting:  \n – Instead of “use text: format: …”, use a prompt that explicitly instructs the AI:\n  “For the final output, incorporate the following result from the tool call: [insert tool output]. Then, output a JSON object that strictly conforms to this schema: { …specify your keys, types, etc… }.”\n\n• Intermediate Parsing Step:  \n – After the tool call returns its text output, you might explicitly parse that into a variable on your MCP server. Then send that variable as part of your next prompt. In other words, do the concatenation and formatting on your end before sending it back to the API.\n\n• Using Function Calling (if applicable):  \n – OpenAI’s function calling framework is designed to enforce JSON schemas. By defining a function with parameters that match your JSON schema, you can let the API “call” your function, effectively returning JSON that matches your expected format. Ensure that the earlier tool output is available in the conversation so that the function call’s parameters can be informed by that result.\n\n─────────────────────────────  \nExample Pseudocode\n\nImagine something like this (pseudocode):\n\n--------------------------------------------------\nStep 1: Get tool result\ntool_response = call_tool()                             // returns text output\n\n--------------------------------------------------\nStep 2: Final API call with context and expected JSON format\nfinal_prompt = \"\"\"\nWe previously got the following result from our tool:\n\"{tool_response}\"\n\nBased on this, please produce a JSON object that matches the following schema exactly:\n{\n  \"summary\": string,\n  \"details\": string,\n  \"metadata\": {\n      \"timestamp\": string,\n      \"status\": string\n  }\n}\nPlease make sure the JSON is valid and nothing extra is included.\n\"\"\"\n\nfinal_response = openai.response.parse(…final_prompt…)\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nIn this example, you are explicitly including the tool output in the prompt so the model “considers” it before formatting the final JSON.\n\n─────────────────────────────\n\nIf you have more specific issues (for example, errors related to parsing, truncation, or incorrect keys), please let me know with additional details. That way, we can dive deeper into the exact behavior you’re observing and adjust the prompt or the implementation accordingly.\n\nDoes this help clarify your scenario and potential approaches to ensure the final output meets your JSON schema requirements?",

You want to:\n\n1. Use the OpenAI responses API with `openai.response.parse`\n2. Call a tool to get certain output data\n3. Have the AI consider that tool's output\n4. Format the final response in a specific JSON schema\n\n## Implementation Approach\n\nHere's how this flow might work:\n\n```javascript\n// Example of how you might structure this\nasync function processWithAI(userQuery) {\n  try {\n    // Make the initial call to OpenAI\n    const response = await openai.chat.completions.create({\n      model: \"gpt-4\",\n      messages: [\n        { role: \"system\", content: \"You are an assistant that processes MCP data.\" },\n        { role: \"user\", content: userQuery }\n      ],\n      tools: [\n        {\n          type: \"function\",\n          function: {\n            name: \"fetch_mcp_data\",\n            description: \"Fetches data from the MCP server\",\n            parameters: {\n              type: \"object\",\n              properties: {\n                query: {\n                  type: \"string\",\n                  description: \"The query to send to MCP\"\n                }\n              },\n              required: [\"query\"]\n            }\n          }\n        }\n      ],\n      tool_choice: \"auto\"\n    });\n\n    // Parse the response\n    const parsedResponse = openai.response.parse(response);\n    \n    if (parsedResponse.tool_calls) {\n      // Handle tool calls\n      const toolCall = parsedResponse.tool_calls[0];\n      if (toolCall.function.name === \"fetch_mcp_data\") {\n        // Extract the query\n        const { query } = JSON.parse(toolCall.function.arguments);\n        \n        // Call your MCP server with the query\n        const mcpData = await callMCPServer(query);\n        \n        // Send the tool results back to OpenAI for final processing\n        const finalResponse = await openai.chat.completions.create({\n          model: \"gpt-4\",\n          messages: [\n            { role: \"system\", content: \"Format the final response in the required JSON schema.\" },\n            { role: \"user\", content: userQuery },\n            { role: \"assistant\", content: parsedResponse.content || \"\" },\n            { role: \"tool\", content: JSON.stringify(mcpData), tool_call_id: toolCall.id }\n          ],\n          response_format: { type: \"json_object\" }\n        });\n        \n        return finalResponse.choices[0].message.content;\n      }\n    }\n    \n    // If no tool was called, return the direct response\n    return parsedResponse.content;\n  } catch (error) {\n    console.error(\"Error processing with AI:\", error);\n    throw error;\n  }\n}\n\n// Example function to call your MCP server\nasync function callMCPServer(query) {\n  // Implementation to call your MCP server\n  // Return the data from MCP\n  return { /* MCP data */ };\n}\n```\n\n## Common Issues\n\nWhen implementing this pattern, you might encounter challenges with:\n\n1. **Parsing issues**: Ensuring that `openai.response.parse()` correctly handles the response format\n\n2. **Tool execution flow**: Managing the asynchronous nature of tool calls and responses\n\n3. **JSON schema enforcement**: Ensuring the final output strictly adheres to your required JSON schema\n\n4. **Error handling**: Properly handling failures at different stages of the process\n\n## Solution\n\nTo ensure your JSON schema is properly formatted in the final output, you should:\n\n1. Clearly define the schema in your system prompt\n2. Use the `response_format` parameter with `type: \"json_object\"` in your final call\n3. Consider adding validation for the returned JSON before using it in your application\n\nThis approach allows you to leverage the MCP server's data while maintaining control over the final output format through OpenAI's response parsing capabilities.",

          "response": "It sounds like you're encountering an issue where your MCP server integration works with text format but fails when using `openai.response.parse` with a structured JSON schema. This is a common issue when combining tool calls with structured outputs.\n\nHere are a few potential solutions and debugging approaches:\n\n## 1. Two-Step Approach (Recommended)\n\nInstead of trying to do everything in one call, separate the tool usage from the structured output:\n\n```python\nimport openai\nfrom pydantic import BaseModel\n\n# Step 1: Use tools to get the data\ntool_response = client.chat.completions.create(\n    model=\"gpt-4\",\n    messages=[\n        {\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"Get the data I need using the MCP tool\"}\n    ],\n    tools=[your_mcp_tool_definition],\n    tool_choice=\"auto\"\n)\n\n# Extract tool results\ntool_data = extract_tool_results(tool_response)\n\n# Step 2: Use structured output with the tool data\nclass FinalOutput(BaseModel):\n    analysis: str\n    recommendation: str\n    data_summary: dict\n\nfinal_response = client.beta.chat.completions.parse(\n    model=\"gpt-4\",\n    messages=[\n        {\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": f\"Based on this data: {tool_data}, provide analysis\"},\n        {\"role\": \"assistant\", \"content\": tool_response.choices[0].message.content},\n        {\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"Now format this into the required structure\"}\n    ],\n    response_format=FinalOutput\n)\n```\n\n## 2. Check Tool Integration Compatibility\n\nEnsure your MCP server tools are properly formatted for OpenAI's API:\n\n```python\n# Make sure your tool definition follows OpenAI's schema\nmcp_tool = {\n    \"type\": \"function\",\n    \"function\": {\n        \"name\": \"your_mcp_function\",\n        \"description\": \"Description of what it does\",\n        \"parameters\": {\n            \"type\": \"object\",\n            \"properties\": {\n                # your parameters\n            },\n            \"required\": []\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\n## 3. Single Call with Proper Message History\n\nIf you want to keep it in one call, ensure proper message formatting:\n\n```python\nclass OutputSchema(BaseModel):\n    result: str\n    analysis: str\n\nresponse = client.beta.chat.completions.parse(\n    model=\"gpt-4\",\n    messages=[\n        {\n            \"role\": \"user\", \n            \"content\": \"Use the MCP tool to get data, then analyze it\"\n        }\n    ],\n    tools=[your_mcp_tool],\n    response_format=OutputSchema,\n    # This might be the key - ensure the model can use tools AND structured output\n    tool_choice=\"auto\"\n)\n```\n\n## 4. Debugging Steps\n\n1. **Check the error message**: What specific error are you getting with `response.parse`?\n\n2. **Verify model compatibility**: Ensure you're using a model that supports both tools and structured outputs (like `gpt-4-1106-preview` or newer).\n\n3. **Test tool separately**: Verify your MCP tool works independently.\n\n4. **Check response format**: Make sure your Pydantic model is valid.\n\n## 5. Alternative: Manual Parsing\n\nIf the above doesn't work, you might need to manually parse:\n\n```python\n# Get tool response first\ntool_response = client.chat.completions.create(\n    model=\"gpt-4\",\n    messages=[{\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"Your query\"}],\n    tools=[mcp_tool]\n)\n\n# Then ask for structured format\nstructured_response = client.beta.chat.completions.parse(\n    model=\"gpt-4\",\n    messages=[\n        {\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"Your query\"},\n        tool_response.choices[0].message,  # Include the tool response\n        {\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"Format the above into the required schema\"}\n    ],\n    response_format=YourSchema\n)\n```\n\nCould you share the specific error message you're encountering?

Use a tool (function/tool call) to get some output.\n2. Have the AI consider that tool output before generating a final output in a specific JSON schema.\n3. This process works if you use 'text' format, but you seem to have an issue with another format or step.\n\n**To help you best, could you clarify:**\n\n- What do you mean by \"text: format\"? Are you referring to the response format (e.g., text vs. json_object in the OpenAI API)?\n- What is the exact issue when you don't use 'text' format? Is the AI not considering the tool output, or is the final JSON not following your schema?\n- Are you using function calling/tools in the OpenAI API, or a framework (like LangChain, LlamaIndex, etc.) on top of it?\n- Can you provide a snippet of your API request/response and the relevant configuration?\n\n---\n\n**General Guidance:**\n\nIf you're using OpenAI's function calling with the new v1 API (e.g., /v1/chat/completions):\n\n- If you want the assistant to produce a JSON according to a schema, you should use the response_format: { \"type\": \"json_object\" } parameter in your request.\n- If you want the model to \"consider\" previous tool outputs, you need to include those outputs in the conversation history as a tool message (role: \"tool\", content: \"...tool output...\").\n- If you use text format, the model will respond in plain text, which may be easier to debug but harder to enforce JSON output.\n\n**Example:**\n\n```json\n[\n  {\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"Get the weather for New York.\"},\n  {\"role\": \"assistant\", \"tool_calls\": [{\"id\": \"call_1\", \"function\": {\"name\": \"get_weather\", \"arguments\": \"{\\\"location\\\": \\\"New York\\\"}\"}}]},\n  {\"role\": \"tool\", \"tool_call_id\": \"call_1\", \"content\": \"{\\\"temperature\\\": \\\"75F\\\", \\\"condition\\\": \\\"Sunny\\\"}\"},\n  {\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"Now, using that information, give me a summary in this schema: {\\\"summary\\\": string, \\\"location\\\": string, \\\"temp\\\": string}\"}\n]\n```\n\nWhen you call the API, use:\n\n```json\n\"response_format\": { \"type\": \"json_object\" }\n```\n\n---\n\nIf you provide more details, or clarify the part after \"format:\", I can give you a more precise solution!",

In other words, you want multiple steps:\n\n1) Use your tool to generate some text or data.  \n2) Feed that text/data back into an OpenAI model, so it can “consider” that information.  \n3) Have the model return a final JSON payload matching your schema.\n\nBelow are some tips and examples on how to implement a multi-step flow like this.\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n1) Make sure you have the right prompt structure\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nWhen using the OpenAI (ChatCompletion) API, you can supply multiple messages—each containing a role (system, user, etc.) and some content. You’ll want to ensure you put your “intermediate output” from the tool in a message that the model can see.\n\nFor example (in pseudo-code):\n\nopenai.ChatCompletion.create(\n  model=\"gpt-3.5-turbo\",\n  messages = [\n     {\n       \"role\": \"system\",\n       \"content\": \"You are a helpful assistant...\"\n     },\n     {\n       \"role\": \"user\",\n       \"content\": \"Please analyze this data: ...\"\n     },\n     {\n       \"role\": \"user\",\n       \"content\": \"<Your Tool Output Here>\"\n     },\n     {\n       \"role\": \"user\",\n       \"content\": \"Now generate the final JSON, with schema: ...\"\n     },\n  ]\n)\n\nBy structuring your prompt messages carefully, you can give the model the relevant context (the tool output) before asking it to finalize the JSON.  \n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n2) Tell the model exactly what JSON schema you expect\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nThe single most helpful thing you can do is provide a sample JSON structure or a “template” in your prompt. For example, if you need a JSON object with keys like \"title\", \"description\", and \"metadata\", you can say:\n\n\"Return a strictly valid JSON object with the following keys:\n{\n  'title': string,\n  'description': string,\n  'metadata': {\n    'toolOutput': string,\n    'createdAt': string\n  }\n}\nNo additional keys. Do not wrap in Markdown code blocks.\"\n\nBecause LLMs sometimes include extra tokens or commentary, you’ll get more reliable output if you emphasize “Return only JSON, do not add extra explanation.”\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n3) Consider using “function calling” if your use case allows\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nOpenAI’s newer “function calling” feature (available in gpt-3.5-turbo-0613 and later) allows you to define a JSON schema as a function signature. The model can then directly return JSON in the arguments property of the response. If your approach allows you to adopt function calling, it can give you more control over the final data structure.\n\nRough outline:\n\n• Define your “function” in your API call. For instance:\n\nfunctions = [\n  {\n    \"name\": \"final_json_output\",\n    \"description\": \"Generates the final JSON response.\",\n    \"parameters\": {\n      \"type\": \"object\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"title\": {\"type\": \"string\"},\n        \"description\": {\"type\": \"string\"},\n        \"metadata\": {\n          \"type\": \"object\",\n          \"properties\": {\n            \"toolOutput\": {\"type\": \"string\"},\n            \"createdAt\": {\"type\": \"string\"}\n          }\n        }\n      },\n      \"required\": [\"title\", \"description\", \"metadata\"]\n    }\n  }\n]\n\n• Then add a message instructing the model to call final_json_output with the correct arguments:\n\nmessages = [\n  {\"role\": \"system\", \"content\": \"You are a helpful assistant...\"},\n  {\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"Here's the tool output...\"},\n  {\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"Now produce the JSON output using the function.\"}\n]\n\n• Finally, specify function_call={\"name\": \"final_json_output\"} or allow the model to choose.\n\nWith that setup, the model’s response will have a top-level field \"function_call\" with \"arguments\" in proper JSON. You can parse it directly with standard JSON libraries in your code.\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n4) Verify (and sanitize) the data after you get the response\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nBecause LLMs can sometimes generate unexpected outputs, it’s a good practice to:\n\n• Parse the JSON in your backend code (e.g., using Python’s json.loads or a typesafe schema validator).  \n• Apply any fallback logic if the structure is incomplete or invalid.\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nSummary\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n1. Pass the tool’s intermediate output back to the OpenAI model as part of your prompt messages.  \n2. Explicitly request a strict JSON output, either by describing the schema in the prompt or (preferably) by using the “function calling” feature which encodes your schema as function parameters.  \n3. Parse and validate the returned JSON on your server side before using it downstream.\n\nThat combination—clean prompt structure + either a carefully worded schema or function calling—usually solves the common “it only works if it’s text” problem. It allows you to feed your tool’s output into the model and reliably obtain valid JSON that meets your schema requirements. \n\nIf you’re still running into any issues, consider posting a minimal code snippet (with placeholders for sensitive info) showing how you’re calling openai.ChatCompletion.create, and any logs or errors you see. That often makes debugging more straightforward.",

          "response": "It sounds like you’re using an MP server alongside OpenAI’s responses API (with something like openai.response.parse) to generate output that you then want the AI to “consider” as context before outputting a final result in a specific JSON schema. From what you described, when you mark the content as plain text (using something like text: format: \"…\"), everything works as expected, but when you try to have the AI incorporate that output into a final JSON structure, you run into issues.\n\nA few things to consider and try:\n\n1. Clarify the prompt instructions.  \n • Ensure your prompt clearly tells the AI that its final output must be valid JSON that follows the specified schema.  \n • For example, you might include a directive like “Output only valid JSON in the following format: { … }” and show an example.\n\n2. Isolate chain-of-thought or intermediate output.  \n • If your tool or prompt instructs the assistant to think or “consider” some output before giving the final answer, the assistant may include internal notes that break the JSON.  \n • One common approach is to instruct the model not to output any intermediate reasoning (e.g., “Do not include any explanation or chain-of-thought in your answer—only output the JSON”).\n\n3. Verify the use of the parser.  \n • The openai.response.parse (or a similar function) likely expects a minimal, clean string that exactly adheres to the schema.  \n • When you use a plain text format, you might be bypassing the schema validation. If you’re switching to a JSON schema, make sure the parser isn’t confused by unexpected text.\n • In some cases, you might need to explicitly state that the final answer should have no additional text or commentary besides the JSON structure.\n\n4. Debug formatting issues.  \n • Sometimes extra whitespace, newlines, or non-JSON characters can break strict JSON parsing.  \n • Try to simulate the process by having the AI output exactly what you expect, then test your parser separately to ensure it can parse it.\n\n5. Check your tools’ integration logic.  \n • Ensure that your MP server and the API integration correctly pass the output from the “tool” stage (where you obtain a certain output) into the final prompt that instructs the production of JSON.\n • Sometimes the issue is not with the AI’s output but with how intermediate outputs are concatenated or injected into the final prompt.\n\nIf you can share a simplified version of your prompt or pseudocode of how you’re structuring the process, it might be easier to pinpoint exactly what’s causing the discrepancy when you switch from plain text to the JSON schema format.\n\nIn summary, the key is to ensure that the internal (tool-generated) output is cleanly integrated into a prompt that instructs the AI to output only valid JSON, and to remove any internal commentary or chain-of-thought that might otherwise be added. This way, when your parser runs on the final response, it can successfully interpret the JSON as intended.\n\nDoes this help clarify some potential next steps?",

It sounds like you are working with the OpenAI API, specifically using \"tools\" (such as function calling), and you want to chain outputs: first, let the AI call a tool (function), then have the AI see the tool's output and use it as context for its final response, which should be in a specific JSON schema.\n\nLet me break down the process step by step:\n\n## 1. Initial User Request\n\nThe user sends a prompt/request to your MCP server.  \nExample:  \nWhat is the weather in Paris and summarize it as a travel tip?\n\n## 2. Preparing the API Call\n\nYou forward this request to OpenAI's API, specifying:\n\n- The model (e.g., gpt-4-turbo)\n- The tool(s) available (using the tools parameter; e.g., a weather lookup function)\n- The final response format (could use response_format: { \"type\": \"json_object\" })\n\n## 3. OpenAI Decides on a Tool Call\n\nIf the model thinks a tool call is needed, it responds with a tool_call in the choices array:\n\n{\n  \"choices\": [\n    {\n      \"message\": {\n        \"tool_calls\": [\n          {\n            \"id\": \"call_abc123\",\n            \"function\": {\n              \"name\": \"get_weather\",\n              \"arguments\": \"{\\\"location\\\": \\\"Paris\\\"}\"\n            }\n          }\n        ]\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}\n\n## 4. MCP Server Handles the Tool Call\n\nYour server detects the tool_call (via openai.response.parse), extracts the arguments, and calls the relevant tool (e.g., a weather API).\n\n## 5. MCP Server Sends Tool Output Back to OpenAI\n\nYou send another message to the OpenAI API, appending:\n\n- The original user message\n- The assistant's tool_call message\n- A new message of type tool with the tool's output, like:\n\n{\n  \"role\": \"tool\",\n  \"tool_call_id\": \"call_abc123\",\n  \"content\": \"{\\\"temperature\\\": \\\"18C\\\", \\\"condition\\\": \\\"sunny\\\"}\"\n}\n\n## 6. OpenAI Considers the Tool Output\n\nOpenAI now has the tool result as context and can generate a final response, perhaps:\n\n{\n  \"role\": \"assistant\",\n  \"content\": \"{\\\"travel_tip\\\": \\\"The weather in Paris is sunny and 18C. Pack light clothes and enjoy outdoor cafes!\\\"}\"\n}\n\n## 7. Enforcing JSON Schema (Optional)\n\nIf you want the output in a specific schema, you can:\n\n- Use response_format: { \"type\": \"json_object\" } in the API call (if model supports it)\n- Or, instruct the model via the system prompt: \"Always reply in this JSON format: { ... }\"\n\n## 8. Deliver Final Output\n\nYour MCP server parses the AI's final response and sends it to the user.\n\n---\n\n## Important Notes\n\n- If you use text format (plain text output), the model is less restricted and can freely reference tool outputs in natural language.\n- If you use response_format: { \"type\": \"json_object\" }, the model will output valid JSON, but may be less \"chatty\".\n- openai.response.parse is useful for extracting function/tool calls from the response.\n\n---\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\n- If the process works in text mode but not in JSON mode, ensure:\n  - Your tool output is valid JSON and matches what the model expects.\n  - Your system prompt or function descriptions clearly explain the desired output format.\n  - You're chaining the messages correctly, preserving tool call IDs and context.\n\n---\n\n## Example Pseudocode\n\nmessages = [\n  {\"role\": \"system\", \"content\": \"Reply in this JSON schema: {travel_tip: string}\"},\n  {\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"What is the weather in Paris and summarize it as a travel tip?\"}\n]\n\n// 1st API call\nresponse = openai.chat.completions.create(\n    model=\"gpt-4-turbo\",\n    tools=[get_weather_function],\n    messages=messages\n)\n\n// Parse tool call\ntool_call = openai.response.parse(response)\n\n// Run tool\nweather_result = call_weather_api(tool_call.arguments)\n\n// Add tool output\nmessages.append({\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"tool_calls\": [tool_call]\n})\nmessages.append({\n    \"role\": \"tool\",\n    \"tool_call_id\": tool_call.id,\n    \"content\": json.dumps(weather_result)\n})\n\n// 2nd API call for final response\nfinal_response = openai.chat.completions.create(\n    model=\"gpt-4-turbo\",\n    messages=messages,\n    response_format={\"type\": \"json_object\"}\n)\n\nreturn final_response[\"choices\"][0][\"message\"][\"content\"]\n\n---\n\nIf you share your current code or error, I can give more specific advice!",

          "response": "Below is a general outline you can follow when trying to use an MCP server alongside the OpenAI API, parsing intermediate output with openai.response.parse, then having the AI consider that information before crafting a final response. Each of these steps is suggestive because the exact approach depends on your specific deployment environment and libraries, but it should provide a solid, high-level guide.\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n1. Set Up Your MCP Server\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n1.1. Install/Configure MCP  \n   • If you haven’t already, install or configure your MCP server. This can vary depending on the framework or system you’re using.  \n   • Make sure it’s correctly set up to listen for incoming requests on the desired host/port.\n\n1.2. Expose an Endpoint for AI Queries  \n   • Decide which endpoint(s) will handle requests destined for the OpenAI API.  \n   • For example, you might have an endpoint like /api/ai-process or /api/openai-request.  \n   • This endpoint should accept relevant payloads (e.g., prompt text, conversation history, etc.) from your front end or other services.\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n2. Integrate with the OpenAI API\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n2.1. Install the Necessary OpenAI Client Library  \n   • In most Node.js environments:  \n     npm install openai  \n   • Or in Python, you might install the openai package:  \n     pip install openai  \n\n2.2. Configure Your OpenAI Client  \n   • Set your OPENAI_API_KEY as an environment variable.  \n   • Initialize the OpenAI client in your server code. For example (Node.js pseudocode):\n\n     const { Configuration, OpenAIApi } = require('openai');\n\n     const configuration = new Configuration({\n       apiKey: process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY,\n     });\n     const openai = new OpenAIApi(configuration);\n\n2.3. Set Request Parameters  \n   • Decide how you’ll structure your request to OpenAI (model, temperature, max_tokens, etc.).  \n   • Typically, you’ll do something like:\n\n     const response = await openai.createChatCompletion({\n       model: 'gpt-4',\n       messages: [\n         { role: 'system', content: 'System instructions...' },\n         { role: 'user', content: 'User prompt...' },\n       ],\n       temperature: 0.7,\n       // etc.\n     });\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n3. Use openai.response.parse (If Applicable)\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n3.1. Understand the Purpose of openai.response.parse  \n   • The openai.response.parse utility (depending on the library or custom implementation you’re using) can help structure or extract specific data from the text response.  \n   • You might want to parse the AI’s response for certain tokens, JSON structures, or custom output formats.\n\n3.2. Parse Intermediate Output  \n   • If you want to have an “intermediate step,” you can request the AI to produce raw data first.  \n   • For example, you might instruct the AI to output a JSON snippet with certain keys, or produce a structured list.  \n   • Then pass that raw data string into openai.response.parse to transform or validate it.  \n   • Example concept:\n\n     // Suppose you got a \"raw\" AI response with a JSON snippet in the text:\n     const rawAIResponse = response.data.choices[0].message.content;\n\n     // Use parse (you might create your own parse function or use a library):\n     const parsedData = openai.response.parse(rawAIResponse);\n\n3.3. Store or Re-Include the Parsed Data  \n   • Save parsedData in a variable or database if you want.  \n   • In your next prompt to the AI, you can feed back the relevant data to incorporate it into the final stage of reasoning.\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n4. Have the AI Consider the Parsed Output\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n4.1. Craft a New Prompt Incorporating the Parsed Data  \n   • Once you have your parsed intermediate output (e.g., some summary, relevant strings, or structured data), you can ask the AI to use it.  \n   • The conversation might look like this:\n\n     messages: [\n       { role: 'system', content: 'System instructions...' },\n       {\n         role: 'user',\n         content: `Here is the parsed data from the previous step:\n         ${JSON.stringify(parsedData)}\n         Using this data, produce the final response in the specified JSON schema.`\n       }\n     ]\n\n4.2. Specify the Final JSON Schema or Format  \n   • In your instructions, explicitly outline the final JSON structure you need. For example:\n\n     \"Please output your response in valid JSON with the following schema:\n     {\n       \"result\": \"string\",\n       \"explanation\": \"string\"\n     }\n     ...\"\n\n4.3. Make the Final Request  \n   • Call openai.createChatCompletion (or whichever method you’re using) again with the updated prompt that references the parsed data.  \n   • This ensures that the final output includes the new data and follows the specified JSON format.\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n5. Return the AI Response in JSON\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n5.1. Validate the Final AI Response  \n   • Once you receive the final content from the AI, check that it is valid JSON (if the AI might have included extra text).  \n   • You can apply a JSON parse function in a try/catch block:\n\n     const finalAIResponse = response.data.choices[0].message.content;\n     let finalJson;\n     try {\n       finalJson = JSON.parse(finalAIResponse);\n     } catch (err) {\n       // Handle error (e.g., fall back to raw text or request a reformat)\n     }\n\n5.2. Send/Use the Final JSON  \n   • Return this final JSON from your MCP server endpoint to your front end or other services.\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n6. Common Pitfalls & Tips\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n6.1. Ensuring Proper Prompt Instructions  \n   • The AI needs crystal-clear instructions to structure its output in JSON.  \n   • If you’re seeing extraneous text or broken JSON, add explicit comments like:  \n     “Do not include any extra text. Only respond with valid JSON that follows this exact schema…”\n\n6.2. Handling JSON Escaping/Formatting Issues  \n   • Sometimes the AI might produce invalid JSON if the content includes special characters.  \n   • You may need to either sanitize strings before final output or instruct the AI to escape any quotes internally.\n\n6.3. Dealing with Large Payloads  \n   • If your parsed data is large, consider summarizing or chunking.  \n   • Large context might exceed token limits, so plan prompts accordingly.\n\n6.4. Keeping the Conversation Logic Clear  \n   • If you’re using multiple steps, be sure you keep track of what was said in each request.  \n   • You can also store the conversation history in a session to maintain context across calls.\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n\nExample Flow Summary:\n1) Client → MCP Endpoint: “Generate info about X”  \n2) MCP Endpoint → OpenAI: “Raw output request, please produce partial structured data.”  \n3) AI → Returns partial structured data as a text/JSON snippet → parse with openai.response.parse.  \n4) MCP Endpoint → OpenAI: “Here is the parsed data, now create the final JSON with schema Y.”  \n5) AI → Returns final JSON → parse/validate and send back to client.\n\nBy following these steps, your MCP server can orchestrate a multi-step AI reasoning process (first producing some intermediate artifacts, parsing them, and then making a final request) to ensure the end-user receives JSON in the exact format you want.",

          "response": "Below is a step-by-step breakdown for how you might architect and implement the process you described. In this scenario, your MCP server is acting as the orchestrator that calls OpenAI’s API, uses an intermediate tool (openai.response.parse) to get a specific output, and then uses that output as context for a final call that formats a JSON output according to a defined schema. (For this explanation we assume that you have all of the necessary API credentials, the MCP server is correctly set up, and you’re using the supported client libraries.)\n\n──────────────────────────────\nStep 1. Define Your Overall Flow\n\n• The MCP server receives a request (or triggers a process) that requires a two-step transformation.\n• In the first step, you issue a prompt to OpenAI’s API asking for an intermediate output. This output is structured as plain text and then parsed by openai.response.parse.\n• In the second step, the result of that intermediate task is injected into a follow-up prompt. This prompt instructs the AI to “consider” the intermediate output when generating a final answer, which it must output in a strict JSON schema.\n\n──────────────────────────────\nStep 2. Setup Your MCP Server to Communicate with OpenAI\n\n• Ensure that your MCP server has installed the OpenAI client library.\n• Set up your API credentials and configuration.\n• For example, in Python you might have:\n\n  import openai\n  openai.api_key = \"your_openai_api_key\"\n\n• Also ensure that openai.response.parse (or the equivalent tool if it’s a custom parser) is installed and available.\n\n──────────────────────────────\nStep 3. Create the First Prompt (Intermediate Output)\n\n• Craft a prompt that instructs the AI to produce the intermediate output in a “text:” format.\n• For example, the prompt might be:\n  \"Please generate a summary or a structured list of key data points (as plain text) from the provided data: …\"\n• Use the OpenAI API call with your prompt. For example:\n\n  response = openai.ChatCompletion.create(\n   model=\"gpt-4\",\n   messages=[{\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"… your prompt here …\"}],\n   # You might include formatting hints like: text: format\n  )\n\n• Verify that when you run this call, you receive the output in the expected text format.\n\n──────────────────────────────\nStep 4. Parse the Intermediate Output\n\n• Once you receive the AI’s response, pass the text output to openai.response.parse.\n• This tool will help you extract or reformat the text output into a variant that can be easily inserted into the next prompt.\n• For example:\n\n  parsed_output = openai.response.parse(response_text)\n  # Now, parsed_output holds the structured data you want the AI to consider\n\n• The parsing step is critical because it ensures that when you supply the data again to the AI, it’s in the proper structure or notation without extraneous formatting.\n\n──────────────────────────────\nStep 5. Create the Final Prompt with the JSON Schema\n\n• Now craft a final prompt that includes instructions to the AI to “consider the following data” (from the parsed output) and output the final answer in a strict JSON schema.\n• Your final prompt might look like:\n\n  \"Based on the following data: [insert parsed_output here],\n  please produce a final answer that complies with the following JSON schema:\n  {\n   \"result\": string,\n   \"details\": { \"info\": string, \"timestamp\": string }\n  }\n  Make sure your output is valid JSON with no additional commentary.\"\n\n• The key here is to ensure that the instructions and schema are clear enough so the AI’s output can be unambiguously parsed as JSON.\n\n──────────────────────────────\nStep 6. Execute the Final OpenAI API Call\n\n• With your final prompt in place, make the second call to the OpenAI API:\n\n  final_response = openai.ChatCompletion.create(\n   model=\"gpt-4\",\n   messages=[{\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": final_prompt}],\n  )\n\n• Retrieve the output from final_response.\n• Since you instructed the AI to output using a JSON schema, validate (in your MCP server code) that the returned output is valid JSON.\n\n──────────────────────────────\nStep 7. Validate and Use the Final Output\n\n• Parse the final_response content as JSON.\n• Validate that the structure matches your expected schema.\n• If the JSON isn’t valid or doesn’t match the schema, you may include error handling (or even potentially loop back, reformatting instructions or clarifying the context).\n• Once validated, use the JSON output as needed (e.g., sending it to another part of your application, logging it, etc.).\n\n──────────────────────────────\nStep 8. Troubleshooting and Iteration\n\n• You mentioned “It works whenever I use text: format:” indicating that when you use a text-based response format, the AI output behaves as expected.\n• If switching to a JSON format directly (or any other format) causes issues, check the following:\n  – That your prompt doesn’t conflict between instructing for text and for a JSON structure.\n  – That your openai.response.parse is correctly interpreting the text output.\n  – That you are not mixing formatting instructions (e.g., using both “text:” and “json:” keys in a way that might confuse the model).\n\n• It may be worth running tests that print out intermediate outputs to ensure each step is returning the expected format.\n\n──────────────────────────────\nSummary\n\n1. Set up your MCP server and the OpenAI API client.\n2. Create a first prompt that returns a text output.\n3. Parse that output with openai.response.parse.\n4. Build a final prompt incorporating that parsed data and explicit instructions for a JSON schema.\n5. Make a second API call to generate the final output, then validate and process that JSON.\n\nBy following each step and ensuring that the formatting instructions are unambiguous at each stage (especially when switching from plain text to a JSON schema), you should be able to integrate the intermediate output into the final AI response seamlessly.\n\nFeel free to ask if you need further details on any of these steps!",

Define OpenAI Function Schema\n```python\ntools = [\n    {\n        \"type\": \"function\",\n        \"function\": {\n            \"name\": \"get_mcp_data\",\n            \"description\": \"Retrieve data from MCP server for analysis\",\n            \"parameters\": {\n                \"type\": \"object\",\n                \"properties\": {\n                    \"query\": {\n                        \"type\": \"string\",\n                        \"description\": \"Query to send to MCP server\"\n                    }\n                },\n                \"required\": [\"query\"]\n            }\n        }\n    }\n]\n```\n\n### 5. First OpenAI Call (Tool Usage)\n```python\nasync def get_tool_response(user_input: str):\n    response = await openai.chat.completions.create(\n        model=\"gpt-4\",\n        messages=[\n            {\n                \"role\": \"system\", \n                \"content\": \"You are an assistant that uses tools to gather information before providing final answers.\"\n            },\n            {\n                \"role\": \"user\", \n                \"content\": user_input\n            }\n        ],\n        tools=tools,\n        tool_choice=\"auto\"\n    )\n    \n    return response\n```\n\n### 6. Handle Tool Calls and Get MCP Data\n```python\nasync def process_tool_calls(response):\n    tool_outputs = []\n    \n    if response.choices[0].message.tool_calls:\n        for tool_call in response.choices[0].message.tool_calls:\n            if tool_call.function.name == \"get_mcp_data\":\n                args = json.loads(tool_call.function.arguments)\n                mcp_result = await get_mcp_data(args[\"query\"])\n                \n                tool_outputs.append({\n                    \"tool_call_id\": tool_call.id,\n                    \"output\": json.dumps(mcp_result)\n                })\n    \n    return tool_outputs\n```\n\n### 7. Second OpenAI Call with Structured Output\n```python\nasync def get_final_structured_response(messages, tool_outputs):\n    # Add tool results to conversation\n    messages.append({\n        \"role\": \"tool\",\n        \"content\": json.dumps(tool_outputs),\n        \"tool_call_id\": tool_outputs[0][\"tool_call_id\"] if tool_outputs else None\n    })\n    \n    # Get structured response\n    response = await openai.beta.chat.completions.parse(\n        model=\"gpt-4\",\n        messages=messages + [\n            {\n                \"role\": \"system\",\n                \"content\": \"Based on the tool output above, provide a structured response considering all the gathered information.\"\n            }\n        ],\n        response_format=FinalOutput\n    )\n    \n    return response.choices[0].message.parsed\n```\n\n### 8.

Générer une certaine sortie (par exemple, un texte brut ou bien un JSON).  \n2. Réutiliser ce résultat en entrée pour une seconde requête à l’API.  \n3. Obtenir un résultat final répondant à un schéma JSON précis.  \n\n…alors vous devez vérifier plusieurs points :\n\n1) La sortie intermédiaire que vous générez doit être clairement encodée (souvent en JSON ou en texte brut) et transmise telle quelle dans le prompt de la requête suivante.  \n   – Par exemple :  \n     ------------------------------------------------------------------  \n     \"Voici la sortie d’un outil précédent : …  \n      Dans la suite, considère cette sortie pour produire la réponse finale au format JSON suivant : ...\"  \n     ------------------------------------------------------------------  \n\n2) Le prompting doit clairement préciser le schéma de réponse attendu et les contraintes (cloisonner la réponse dans un objet JSON, éviter du texte supplémentaire en dehors, etc.).  \n   – Par exemple, le prompt pourrait dire :  \n     ------------------------------------------------------------------  \n     \"Produit exactement un JSON au format suivant :  \n       {  \n         \\\"cle\\\": \\\"valeur\\\",  \n         \\\"autreCle\\\": [ … ]  \n       }  \n     Sans texte additionnel en dehors de ce JSON.\"  \n     ------------------------------------------------------------------  \n\n3) Selon la bibliothèque ou le SDK que vous utilisez (OpenAI en Python, openai.Response.Parse en C#, etc.), assurez-vous que la fonction Parse() attend bien ce que vous lui fournissez comme texte / JSON. Il est possible que, si la sortie contient des méta-informations ou un format inattendu, le parseur échoue.  \n\n4) Si vous rencontrez une erreur lors du parsing JSON (du style parsing error, invalid JSON, etc.), vérifiez que le texte de sortie ne contient pas de tokens parasites (par exemple, des «```json» ou des messages de style \"Voici votre JSON\" dans la réponse).  \n\nIl est possible que, lorsque vous utilisez seulement du «texte: Format: …», cela génère un texte brut parfaitement conforme à ce que Parse attend, tandis que la version JSON comprenne quelques caractères ou champs en trop rendant l’analyse impossible.  \n\nSi vous pouvez partager le code appelant openai.Response.Parse (ou son équivalent), ainsi que la partie du prompt qui génère la réponse, ce serait plus facile de repérer ce qui fait planter le parsing. N’hésitez pas à préciser :  \n• Quel langage ou SDK utilisez-vous ?  \n• À quoi ressemble la réponse brute renvoyée par l’API avant le parsing ?  \n• Quel schéma JSON cible essayez-vous d’obtenir ?  \n\nAvec ces informations, on pourra vous aider à ajuster soit le prompt, soit le code, pour obtenir exactement la réponse JSON validée que vous souhaitez.",

Пожалуйста, уточните, что именно не работает или какую именно проблему вы испытываете при использовании сервера MCP и OpenAI API.\n\nОднако, основываясь на вашем описании, попробую дать несколько советов:\n\n1. Формат вывода  \nЕсли вы используете OpenAI API и инструменты (tools) через функцию openai.response.parse, убедитесь, что ваш prompt явно указывает желаемый формат ответа, например:\n\nТы должен проанализировать следующий вывод инструмента и выдать результат в следующей JSON-схеме:\n```json\n{\n  \"summary\": \"...\",\n  \"details\": \"...\"\n}\n```\nИнструмент выдал: <результат_инструмента>\n\n2. Использование function calling или tools  \nЕсли вы используете функцию tools (или function calling), то результат инструмента обычно возвращается в виде отдельного блока, и ваша задача — правильно обработать результат, передав его в следующий запрос.\n\n3. Пример цепочки  \nВот пример цепочки для получения вывода инструмента и последующего анализа:\n\n- Первый запрос: вызываете инструмент через tool call.\n- Получаете результат, парсите его.\n- Второй запрос: передаёте результат инструмента в prompt и просите OpenAI выдать итоговый JSON.\n\nПример prompt для второго запроса:\nПроанализируй результат: <output>\nВыдай результат в формате:\n```json\n{\n  \"summary\": \"...\",\n  \"reasoning\": \"...\",\n  \"final_decision\": true\n}\n```\n\n4. Возможные проблемы  \n- Убедитесь, что AI получает всю нужную ему информацию в prompt.\n- Проверьте, что JSON-схема короткая и простая, иначе модель может ошибаться в структуре.\n- Иногда помогает добавить инструкцию: «Ответь только JSON, без лишних комментариев».\n\nЕсли вы дополните свой вопрос (например, пример кода, точную ошибку, которую вы получаете, или полный текст неработающего запроса), я смогу дать более конкретный совет!",

          "response": "Ниже разберём несколько важных моментов, которые часто вызывают затруднения при попытке заставить модель сначала «сходить» к какому-то инструменту (например, чтобы получить нужные данные), а затем на основе результатов инструмента вернуть итоговый ответ строго в формате JSON-схемы.\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n1. Общая идея: «Сходить к инструменту» и передать результат модели\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nПредположим, у вас есть внешний «инструмент» (Tool), который по запросу возвращает какие-то данные. Допустим, вы делаете примерно так (упрощённый пример на Python):\n\n1) Отправляете запрос к инструменту и получаете результат (строка или словарь).  \n2) Встраиваете полученный результат в ваш prompt (messages), который затем передаёте в OpenAI ChatCompletion.  \n3) Говорите модели, как именно она должна использовать полученный результат и в каком формате вы хотите финальный ответ.\n\nРассмотрим упрощённую схему:\n\ntool_result = get_tool_result(some_input)  # Шаг 1: вызов «инструмента» \n# Пример: tool_result = \"Найдена цена 350 рублей и рейтинг 4.7\"\n\nprompt_messages = [\n   {\n     \"role\": \"system\",\n     \"content\": (\n       \"Ты — полезный ассистент. Тебе будут даны данные, которые вернул инструмент, \"\n       \"а также инструкция, как оформить конечный ответ. Важно: нужно вернуть только \"\n       \"валидный JSON без дополнительных пояснений и текста.\"\n     )\n   },\n   {\n     \"role\": \"user\",\n     \"content\": (\n       f\"Данные от инструмента: {tool_result}\\n\\n\"\n       \"Теперь сгенерируй JSON в формате:\\n\"\n       \"{\\n\"\n       '  \"price\": <число>,\\n'\n       '  \"rating\": <число>,\\n'\n       '  \"comment\": \"<строка>\",\\n'\n       '  ...\\n'\n       \"}.\\n\\n\"\n       \"Пожалуйста, ответь строго в JSON-формате, без дополнительных полей.\"\n     )\n   }\n]\n\nresponse = openai.ChatCompletion.create(\n   model=\"gpt-3.5-turbo\",\n   messages=prompt_messages,\n   temperature=0\n)\n\nfinal_answer = response.choices[0].message[\"content\"]\n# На этом этапе мы ожидаем, что final_answer — это валидный JSON.\n\nПосле этого вы сможете делать, например,  \nparsed_answer = json.loads(final_answer)  \nи уже дальше обрабатывать данные.\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n2. Типичные «подводные камни» при выводе JSON\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n1) Модель нередко «любит» добавлять пояснения, текст до/после JSON или оформлять результат в виде Markdown-блоков.  \n   – Чтобы минимизировать это, используйте в system-сообщениях строгие указания:  \n     «Отвечай только JSON. Не добавляй никаких слов вне JSON. Не используй Markdown.»  \n   – При необходимости можно дополнить это user-месседжем-напоминанием.  \n\n2) Если вы не используете ChatCompletion, а, скажем, Completions (старый эндпоинт text-davinci-003), чётко указывайте stop-токены, которые помогут «обрезать» модель там, где вы хотите. Но в большинстве случаев лучше использовать ChatCompletion.  \n\n3) Если формат JSON сложный, убедитесь, что в prompt вы даёте понятную структуру схемы и пример. Например:  \n   \"Формат JSON:\\n{\\n  \\\"fields\\\": [\\n    {\\n      \\\"name\\\": \\\"String\\\",\\n      \\\"value\\\": \\\"Number\\\"\\n    }\\n  ],\\n  \\\"status\\\": \\\"String\\\"\\n}\\n\\n\"  \n   Чем подробнее пример, тем выше вероятность получить корректный результат.\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n3. Что делать, если нужно получить и «промежуточный» результат, и конечный?\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nБывают сценарии, когда вы хотите, чтобы модель:  \n• Сначала вызвала инструмент (например, через plugins или через ваш внешний код),  \n• Затем «одумалась/проанализировала» ответ этого инструмента,  \n• И в итоге выдала JSON.\n\nВ классической схеме (без нового механизма function calling) это решается тем, что вы сами вызываете инструмент и подставляете результат как контекст. Модель его «читает» из prompt, формирует итог.  \n\nНо если вы хотите, чтобы сама модель напрямую «дергала» функцию (функционал ChatGPT Plugins или function calling в OpenAI API — ChatCompletion), тогда можно воспользоваться новым режимом ChatCompletion с function calls:\n\n• Вы описываете функцию (с её аргументами и JSON-схемой),  \n• Модель «вызывает» эту функцию (по сути, возвращая специальный параметр function_call в ответе),  \n• Вы сами в коде вызываете реальный инструмент с теми аргументами, которые модель предложила,  \n• Затем возвращаете ответ инструмента модели в новом сообщении (role=“function”),  \n• Модель формирует финальный ответ (role=“assistant”).  \n\nОднако в большинстве случаев достаточно первого подхода: выручать инструмент «снаружи» кода, а модель просто читает результат из prompt.\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n4. Почему «работает при текст: формат:…», но не работает при JSON?\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nЕсли модель «загрязняет» JSON лишними текстовыми вставками или не соблюдает структуру, причины могут быть такие:\n\n1) Модель «не поняла», что от неё требуется строго JSON (нет прямого и чёткого указания в system).  \n2) В вашем prompt нет примера «как должен выглядеть правильный JSON».  \n3) Модель пытается быть «вежливой» и включать пояснения. Чем жёстче вы в system-сообщении пропишите условия — тем лучше результат.  \n4) Возможно, в коде, который принимает ответ от openai (openai.response.parse), есть какие-то дополнительные фильтры или он не умеет парсить «грязный» JSON (с комментариями, пояснениями и т.п.).  \n\nЧтобы застраховаться, дайте модели образец:\n\n\"Пример строго валидного JSON (без лишних символов и дробных запятых):\n{\n  \\\"price\\\": 350,\n  \\\"rating\\\": 4.7,\n  \\\"comment\\\": \\\"Цена хорошая, рейтинг тоже\\\"\n}\n\nТолько это и больше ничего.\"\n\nПосле таких инструкций вероятность правильной генерации заметно выше.\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n5. Резюме\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n• Вызовите ваш «инструмент» отдельно, сохраните его результат.  \n• Включите результат инструмента в prompt (вместе с требованиями к формату ответа).  \n• Используйте ChatCompletion (рекомендуется) или Completions, если нужно. Важно явно указать: «Верни ответ только в таком-то JSON-формате».  \n• Для более надёжного контроля формата:  \n  – Дайте пример нужного JSON.  \n  – Запретите любые тексты вне JSON (в system-месседже).  \n  – Опционально, после получения ответа, используйте json.loads для валидации. Если парсинг «падает» — можно повторить запрос к модели с сообщением об ошибке.\n\nТаким образом, когда вы хотите «сначала собрать данные из инструмента, а потом выдать JSON», ключ к успеху — чётко структурировать ваш prompt и указать, что модель должна дать ровно JSON. Тогда ваш MCP-сервер (или любая обвязка) сможет уверенно распарсить вывод.",

          "response": "Привет! Кажется, вы хотите выстроить цепочку запросов, в которой сначала вызывается инструмент (и возвращается промежуточный вывод), а затем этот вывод передаётся в дальнейший запрос к OpenAI, чтобы итоговый ответ соответствовал определённой схеме JSON. Но из вашего сообщения не до конца понятно, где именно возникает проблема. Возможно, вы пишете что-то вроде:\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------\n«Инструкция: Используй инструмент и получи промежуточный вывод.\nПромежуточный вывод: <результат инструмента>\nТеперь проанализируй этот промежуточный вывод и сформируй итоговый ответ в формате JSON: { \"ключ1\": <значение>, \"ключ2\": <значение> }»\n----------------------------------------------------------------\n\nЕсли мой вывод верен, то ниже несколько соображений, которые могут помочь:\n\n1.  Шаги цепочки запросов. Обратите внимание, что для корректной работы вам нужно строго разделить этап получения промоутированного (инструментального) вывода и его дальнейшую обработку. Можно использовать два отдельных запроса (или один запрос с явным указанием, чтобы промежуточный результат был сохранён и передан в следующий шаг).\n\n2.  Форматирование итогового ответа. Если вы используете openai.response.parse (или подобный метод), убедитесь, что итоговый ответ строго соответствует JSON-схеме и не содержит дополнительных символов. Например, если модель иногда возвращает обёртки вроде «```json …```», возможно, потребуется дополнительно фильтровать или очищать ответ.\n\n3.  Ясное задание инструкции. В вашем промпте важно чётко указать: (a) принять промежуточный вывод, (b) выполнить анализ, (c) вывести итог в формате JSON согласно заданной схеме. Можно добавить фразу вроде: «Пожалуйста, верни только чистый JSON без дополнительных пояснений или текстовых комментариев».\n\n4.  Логика выполнения на стороне сервера. Проверьте, что сервер MCP правильно передаёт промежуточное значение от первого шага ко второму. Возможно, имеет смысл сохранить этот вывод в переменную, а затем подставить её в финальный запрос.\n\n5.  Тестирование на небольших примерах. Начните с простого примера, когда промежуточный вывод — это простая строка, и убедитесь, что итоговый JSON формируется корректно. После этого усложняйте структуру по мере необходимости.\n\nЕсли проблема проявляется «каждый раз, когда я использую текст: формат: …», возможно, стоит проверить, корректно ли интерпретируется ваша инструкция по формату. Например, если ваша инструкция выглядит как:\n\n  «формат: {\n    \"ключ1\": строка,\n    \"ключ2\": число\n  }»\n\nубедитесь, что модель понимает, что ей нужно вернуть именно JSON, без «отступающих» или «объясняющих» строк.\n\nЕсли вы можете привести более конкретный пример вашего запроса или показать ошибку, которую вы получаете (например, результат не соответствует JSON-схеме), я смогу предложить более детальные рекомендации или исправления.\n\nНадеюсь, это поможет вам разобраться в проблеме! Если есть дополнительные детали или вопросы – пожалуйста, уточните, и я постараюсь помочь дальше.",

Are you saying it only works with a certain text output, but not with your desired JSON format? Or are you running into issues with how the OpenAI API (and its response parsing) interacts with your MCP server and tool output?\n\nIf your goal is to:\n\n1. Use a tool (via the OpenAI function calling or tools API) to get an intermediate output,\n2. Then have the AI consider that output,\n3. And finally produce a response in a specific JSON schema,\n\nHere's how you can approach this:\n\n### 1. Tool Invocation\nWhen you call the OpenAI API using tools (functions), the response will include a tool_calls section, and your MCP server should execute the tool, returning its result. You'll then pass that result back to the API as a tool message.\n\n### 2. Letting the AI Consider Tool Output\nAfter the tool result is provided, the next assistant message can use that output to generate its final answer. To encourage the AI to produce output in your desired JSON schema, you need to:\n\n- Specify the output schema either in the system prompt or in the function definition (if you use function calling).\n- Make sure your last user/assistant message provides clear instructions and, if possible, an example of the desired format.\n\n### 3. Common Pitfall: text vs. JSON Output\nIf you say \"It works whenever I use text: format\", but not with JSON, it could be because:\n\n- The system prompt or tool/function definition isn't enforcing a JSON output.\n- The model needs explicit instruction and/or schema.\n- The openai.response.parse method might expect a certain structure.\n\n### 4. Tips for Reliable JSON Output\n\n- In your system prompt, instruct: \"All outputs must strictly conform to the following JSON schema: { ... }.\"\n- If using function calling, define the function output schema so the model knows to respond in JSON.\n- Use temperature=0 for deterministic, schema-adhering outputs.\n- Validate the assistant's output before parsing; sometimes minor hallucinations or format errors occur.\n\n### Example System Prompt\n\n```python\nsystem_prompt = \"\"\"\nYou are an assistant that must always respond with a JSON object matching this schema:\n{\n  \"result\": string,\n  \"details\": object\n}\nAfter running the required tool, use its output to compose your final JSON response.\n\"\"\"\n```\n\n### Example Function Call Flow (Python pseudocode)\n\n```python\n# 1. Send user message, including the tool/function schema.\n# 2. Assistant responds with tool_calls.\n# 3. MCP server executes tool, returns output.\n# 4. Pass tool output as a message back to OpenAI.\n# 5. Specify in your prompt: \"Now, using the tool output, respond in the required JSON schema.\"\n```\n\n### openai.response.parse\n\n- This is often used to parse structured outputs. If the response is not valid JSON, parsing will fail.\n- If your tool or model sometimes returns text instead of JSON, make sure the prompt enforces JSON output.\n\n---\n\n**If you can share:**\n- The schema you want,\n- A sample tool output,\n- The part of your flow where it fails (or code snippet),\n\nI can give more concrete advice or example code!",

          "response": "Below is a general workflow and some tips on how to chain a tool’s output into your final JSON response when using OpenAI’s API (and, optionally, a function-calling or structured-response approach). The key idea is to feed the tool’s output back into the model as context, then instruct the model to produce JSON that references or transforms that output.\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n1. Make sure the AI “sees” the tool’s output\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n• If you call an external tool (e.g., via your MCP server, or any other service), you must then re-supply that output inside the model’s conversation context.  \n• Typically, you’d do something like:\n  1) Run the tool.  \n  2) Take the response.  \n  3) Pass this response back to OpenAI as part of the next user/system message.  \n\nExample:\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n1) const toolResponse = await callTool(someParameters);\n   // toolResponse might be \"Hello from the tool!\"\n\n2) Then in the next OpenAI call, include this toolResponse in your conversation:\n   messages: [\n     { role: \"system\", content: \"You are a helpful assistant.\" },\n     { role: \"user\", content: \"Consider this tool output: \" + toolResponse },\n     { role: \"user\", content: \"Now please create a JSON response summarizing it.\" }\n   ]\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nIf you are using function calling (with \"functions\" and \"function_call\" in the request), you might supply the toolResponse in a system or user message so the model can reference it.  \n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n2. Use OpenAI’s built-in function calling (optional but recommended)\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nSince you mentioned you want a “final output in a certain JSON schema,” you can leverage the function-calling feature. With function calling, you define a function’s name and JSON schema. The model’s response will (ideally) adhere to that schema automatically.\n\nBelow is a Node.js example using the official openai package:\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nconst { Configuration, OpenAIApi } = require(\"openai\");\n\nconst configuration = new Configuration({\n  apiKey: process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY\n});\nconst openai = new OpenAIApi(configuration);\n\n// 1. Call your external tool and store the result\nasync function run() {\n  const toolResponse = \"Example from the tool\"; // Imagine this came from MCP server\n\n  // 2. Prepare a function definition (for function calling)\n  const functions = [\n    {\n      name: \"createJsonSummary\",\n      description: \"Create a JSON summary from tool output\",\n      parameters: {\n        type: \"object\",\n        properties: {\n          summary: {\n            type: \"string\",\n            description: \"A short summary\"\n          },\n          meta: {\n            type: \"object\",\n            properties: {\n              toolData: {\n                type: \"string\",\n                description: \"The raw output from the tool\"\n              }\n            },\n            required: [\"toolData\"]\n          }\n        },\n        required: [\"summary\", \"meta\"]\n      }\n    }\n  ];\n\n  // 3. Call OpenAI with the tool output in the conversation\n  const response = await openai.createChatCompletion({\n    model: \"gpt-3.5-turbo-0613\",\n    messages: [\n      {\n        role: \"system\",\n        content: \"You are a helpful assistant that returns JSON via a function call.\"\n      },\n      {\n        role: \"user\",\n        content:\n          \"Please summarize the following tool output and return a JSON object. \" +\n          \"The JSON object must include both a 'summary' and also the raw 'toolData'.\\n\\n\" +\n          `TOOL OUTPUT:\\n${toolResponse}`\n      }\n    ],\n    functions,\n    function_call: { name: \"createJsonSummary\" } // Force the function call\n  });\n\n  // 4. Inspect the function_call response\n  //    The assistant should respond with a JSON that looks like:\n  //    {\n  //      \"name\": \"createJsonSummary\",\n  //      \"arguments\": {\n  //        \"summary\": \"...\",\n  //        \"meta\": { \"toolData\": \"...\" }\n  //      }\n  //    }\n  const message = response.data.choices[0].message;\n  const functionArgs = JSON.parse(message.function_call.arguments);\n  console.log(\"Parsed function arguments:\", functionArgs);\n\n  // Now do whatever you need with that JSON\n}\n\nrun().catch(console.error);\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nIn this example:\n• The model is explicitly told (via system + user messages) to produce a JSON summary.  \n• We embed the tool’s output (toolResponse) in the user message.  \n• By system-design, GPT is more likely to read that toolResponse and incorporate it in the final JSON.  \n• Because we used function_call, OpenAI will (attempt to) return a JSON structure in message.function_call.arguments.  \n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n3. If you prefer raw JSON in the text response (no function calling)\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nSometimes you might not want function calling—perhaps you want the assistant’s raw text to contain valid JSON that you can parse. If you must do that, keep these tips in mind:\n\n• In your prompt, explicitly instruct the model to output only JSON—no extra text.  \n• For example:\n  \"Please return only valid JSON. Do not include code fences. \n   The JSON schema must be: { summary: string, meta: { toolData: string } }\"\n\n• Right after generating the response, parse data from string → JSON on your side.  \n• One pitfall: sometimes the model adds extra text or code blocks. Reinforce strict formatting instructions and/or do a post-processing step to handle that.\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n4. Common pitfalls to watch for\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n• Not feeding the tool output back into the model. If the model never sees the tool’s data in the conversation, it can’t incorporate it in the final response.  \n• Asking for the JSON in the same message where you call the tool can fail if you don’t pass the tool’s output back to the AI. You must chain: (1) call tool, (2) re-inject result, (3) request JSON.  \n• The model might “hallucinate” fields if your schema is not well-defined. Use function calling or be very explicit in your prompt.  \n• If you’re using openai.response.parse from some library, ensure it’s set up to parse either the raw text or the function_call arguments depending on your approach.\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nSummary\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nIn short, the main steps are:  \n1) Call your external tool and capture its output.  \n2) Inject that output into your next OpenAI prompt.  \n3) Instruct the model to return a structured JSON response (either via function calling or by returning raw JSON in text).  \n4) Parse the result on your end.  \n\nThat pattern ensures the AI “knows” the tool’s result before generating the final JSON, whether you use plain-text or function-calling format.",

Using Tools and Follow-up: It sounds like you’re attempting to first run a tool to generate some output, then feed that output back into the conversation (or “chain-of-thought”) so the AI can produce a final JSON output conforming to a specific schema. One common approach is to capture the tool output and then include it in your prompt for the final answer. Make sure that the schema instructions are clear and that the model understands how to reference that previous output.\n\n2. The “text:” Format: Your note about “text:” format working might indicate that when you specify the response format explicitly as text, the chain-of-thought or self-consistency is maintained, whereas using alternative formats (or omitting the format directive) might cause the model to lose context or not adhere to the JSON schema as expected.\n\n3. JSON Schema Enforcement: If your final output should strictly adhere to a JSON schema, you might consider explicitly instructing the model (using system messages or explicit prompt instructions) to respond in JSON mode. Also, tools like openai.response.parse may have options or flags to enforce this.\n\nIf you can share a minimal version of your code or the exact prompts you’re using (with any sensitive information redacted), I can provide more detailed help on how to structure your calls for the desired behavior.\n\nLet me know what additional details you can provide, and we’ll work through it!",

Ask for the final output in your desired JSON schema.\n\nExample Prompt Structure\n\nLet’s suppose you want to get weather data via a tool, and then have the AI summarize it in a specific JSON format:\n\nUser prompt:\nGet the current weather in London, then summarize the weather in this JSON schema: { \"location\": str, \"summary\": str, \"temperature_c\": float }\n\nAPI Call (pseudo-steps):\n\n1. Send prompt to the OpenAI API with function/tool definitions for get_weather and summarize_weather.\n2. The assistant will call get_weather as a function/tool.\n3. Receive the get_weather output (e.g., in function_call or tool_call output).\n4. Pass the tool output as context, asking the assistant to create the final summary in your schema.\n\nExample (in conversational JSON for OpenAI API):\n\n[\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"Get the current weather in London, then summarize the weather in this JSON schema: { \\\"location\\\": str, \\\"summary\\\": str, \\\"temperature_c\\\": float }\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"tool_calls\": [\n      {\n        \"name\": \"get_weather\",\n        \"arguments\": \"{ \\\"location\\\": \\\"London\\\" }\"\n      }\n    ]\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"tool\",\n    \"name\": \"get_weather\",\n    \"content\": \"{ \\\"location\\\": \\\"London\\\", \\\"weather\\\": \\\"Rainy\\\", \\\"temperature_c\\\": 14.2 }\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": \"{ \\\"location\\\": \\\"London\\\", \\\"summary\\\": \\\"Rainy\\\", \\\"temperature_c\\\": 14.2 }\"\n  }\n]\n\nKey Points\n\n- The AI needs both the original instruction and the tool output in its context.\n- Your MCP server should pass the tool output back into the conversation as a separate message (role: tool).\n- Use function calling/tool calling with OpenAI’s API (GPT-4-0613 or GPT-4o, etc.) for best results.\n\nIf you show me your current workflow or API call sequence, I can help you refine it to ensure the assistant “waits” for the tool output and then uses it to generate the final structured JSON output.\n\nLet me know if you want example code (Python, Node, etc.) to automate this!",

Then feed that output back to the AI so it “considers” it before producing the final answer in a specific JSON schema.\n\nA few suggestions that might help address your issue:\n\n• Be explicit in your prompt instructions. Make sure your system or developer prompt clearly states that the AI must first interpret a provided tool output (or “scratchpad” chain-of-thought) and then generate the final response in the required JSON schema. For example, you might include wording such as:\n  “First consider the output from the tool below. Then, based on that, produce your final answer strictly following this JSON format: { …your JSON schema… }.”\n\n• Validate the intermediate output. Ensure that the tool always returns a valid, well‐formed output. If it’s intended to be JSON or another specific format, verify that no extraneous text is appended. Sometimes models “over‐explain” or add commentary when you’d prefer just the raw output.\n\n• Use function‐calling if possible. OpenAI’s modern API supports function calls where you define the expected function (or schema) for the final output. This can help enforce that the final answer strictly adheres to your JSON schema.\n\n• Chain your calls carefully. Ensure that the output from the tool is correctly captured and then injected into the next system or user message that instructs the AI to use it. Depending on your implementation, you might have the following steps:\n  1. Call the tool via openai.response.parse (with format: text or another defined output) to get the intermediate result.\n  2. Pass that result as context into a new API call that includes instructions like “consider the output from our tool: [insert output here]. Now produce your final answer following this JSON schema…”\nThis two-stage process helps the model “see” the tool output before creating its final answer.\n\n• Debug logging. It may be useful to log both the tool output and the final AI response to see where the chain might be breaking or if there’s any unexpected text being injected. If the final answer is not in the JSON schema, perhaps the AI agent is not “seeing” or not prioritizing the tool output as intended.\n\nIf you can provide more details (for example, the exact prompt texts or any error messages), I might be able to offer more specific advice. But in general, ensuring that instructions are unambiguous, using function calling or explicit formatting constraints, and carefully integrating the tool output into your conversation history are key steps.\n\nI hope this helps troubleshoot the issue on your MCP server setup with the OpenAI API!",

You mention that it works when you use text: format: ‘...’, but your message ends there.\n\n**Let me try to help based on what you've shared so far:**\n\n## 1. General Workflow\nFrom your description, your workflow is:\n\n1. Call a tool (via an API/tool call) that produces some output.\n2. You want the AI to review or \"consider\" that output.\n3. Have the AI generate a final output in a specific JSON schema, possibly using openai.response.parse.\n\n## 2. Using Tools and Intermediary Steps\nOpenAI's function calling (tools) system is designed for workflows just like this. You can chain function/tool calls, and have the model consider prior outputs by using the conversation history.\n\n### Example Pattern\n\n- **Step 1:** User asks a question.\n- **Step 2:** The model calls a tool (function) to retrieve or process something.\n- **Step 3:** The tool returns its output. This is added to the conversation as a tool message.\n- **Step 4:** The model sees both the original user message and the tool's output, and generates a final answer, possibly formatted as JSON.\n\n## 3. Using openai.response.parse\nIf you're using openai.response.parse (e.g., in Python), you can parse the response into structured data according to a schema.\n\n## 4. Potential Issues\n- If it \"only works\" when you format the tool's output a certain way (`text: format: '...'`), it may be because the AI expects the tool's output to be in a specific structure or schema.\n- If the tool's output is not formatted as expected, the model may not \"notice\" or \"consider\" it correctly.\n\n## 5. Recommendations\n\n- **Ensure consistent input/output format:** Make sure the tool's output is always formatted in a way the AI expects. If you want it to consider that output, it should be clearly labeled and structured.\n- **Use JSON schema consistently:** When requesting the final output, specify the JSON schema explicitly in your prompt or function definition.\n- **Chain tool calls if needed:** If you need more than one tool call, ensure your orchestration logic allows for multiple steps before the final output.\n- **Debug with verbose outputs:** Log the entire conversation (including tool outputs) to see exactly what the model receives.\n\n## 6. Example (Python pseudocode)\n\n```python\nimport openai\n\n# Step 1: User input\nuser_message = \"Get me the latest weather in London and format it as JSON.\"\n\n# Step 2: Model calls tool\ntool_response = call_weather_api(\"London\")\n# Suppose tool_response = {\"temperature\": 18, \"condition\": \"cloudy\"}\n\n# Step 3: Add tool response as system/user message\nmessages = [\n    {\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": user_message},\n    {\"role\": \"tool\", \"content\": str(tool_response)},\n]\n\n# Step 4: Ask model to produce final output in desired schema\nfinal_prompt = \"Based on the tool response above, provide the final output as: {\\\"weather\\\": {\\\"temp\\\": int, \\\"desc\\\": str}}\"\n\nmessages.append({\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": final_prompt})\n\n# Step 5: Call model\ncompletion = openai.ChatCompletion.create(\n    model=\"gpt-4-turbo\",\n    messages=messages,\n    tools=[...], # include tool definitions if needed\n)\n\n# Step 6: Parse response if needed\nresult = openai.response.parse(completion)\n```\n\n## 7. If You Have a Specific Error\nIf you share the exact code, error, or issue you see (\"it only works when...\"), I can give more targeted help.\n\n---\n\n**If you finish your original message or clarify the issue, I'll be able to give even more specific guidance!**",

          "response": "It sounds like you want to run a two-stage process where:\n\n1. You feed a prompt to OpenAI, parse its output in some intermediate format (e.g., text or JSON).  \n2. Then pass that parsed intermediate result back to OpenAI so that the final output is returned in a specific JSON schema.\n\nBelow are some tips and a general step-by-step approach that often helps with scenarios like this.\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n1. STRUCTURE YOUR WORKFLOW\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n\nA. First Prompt (Generate Intermediate Output)\n   • In this step, you send your first prompt to OpenAI, instructing the model to produce some useful raw data. \n   • For best results, be explicit that you want a robust, unambiguous format you can parse.  \n     For instance, you can ask the model to output plain text lines or a simple JSON object.  \n\n   Example Prompt (pseudo-code):\n   ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n   prompt_1 = \"\"\"\n   You are an assistant that summarizes text. \n   Please summarize the following content in exactly three concise bullet points:\n\n   {some_text_to_summarize}\n   \"\"\"\n   ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n\nB. Parse the Intermediate Output  \n   • After you receive the first response from OpenAI, parse it however you need—perhaps line by line or by explicit JSON keys.  \n   • This allows you to structure or filter the data before giving it back to the model.  \n\nC. Second Prompt (Generate Final JSON Schema)\n   • Now that you have your parsed information from step A, feed it back into a new prompt with instructions to produce the exact JSON schema you need.  \n   • For the final schema, be very precise about the format. Provide an example schema if possible, and highlight any fields or constraints.  \n\n   Example Prompt (pseudo-code):\n   ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n   prompt_2 = f\"\"\"\n   Consider the bullet-point summary you provided:\n   {parsed_summary}\n\n   Now return the answer in the following JSON format:\n\n   {{\n     \"title\": \"string\",\n     \"summary_points\": [\n       \"string\",\n       \"string\",\n       \"string\"\n     ]\n   }}\n\n   Requirements:\n   - The JSON must be valid.\n   - Use the summary points from your bullet list verbatim.\n   - The top-level key \"title\" must be \"Summary of Points\".\n   \"\"\"\n\n   # NOTE: The \"parsed_summary\" might be the bullet points you extracted from step A.\n   ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n\nD. OpenAI Response Parsing  \n   • If you are using something like openai.response.parse, you might have a configuration to enforce or validate JSON. \n   • If you prefer to do it manually, you can take the plain text output from the second prompt and run it through a JSON parser.  \n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n2. ENSURING CONSISTENT JSON FORMAT\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n\nIf you find that the model only respects your format instructions when you request a text-based format (e.g. text: format: '...'), it might be due to how your prompt instructions are set—or how you’re calling openai.response.parse. Here are a few suggestions to improve consistency:\n\n• Use Clear, Repetitive Instructions  \n  In your prompt, remind the model more than once: “Do not add any extra keys. Only return valid JSON as specified.”  \n\n• Provide an Example Schema  \n  Show a small example in your prompt so the model clearly “sees” exactly how you want the final output. For instance:\n  ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n  \"Here’s an example of valid JSON that meets the requirements:\n  {\n    \\\"title\\\": \\\"Summary of Points\\\",\n    \\\"summary_points\\\": [\\\"Point 1\\\", \\\"Point 2\\\", \\\"Point 3\\\"]\n  }\"\n  ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n\n• Leverage the New Function Calling API (If You Can)  \n  OpenAI’s function calling feature (available in the 2023-06-13 preview and beyond) allows you to define a JSON schema in your request, and the model will produce valid JSON that adheres to those keys. This is probably the cleanest way to get a structured JSON response. If you’re using openai.response.parse with something like the ChatCompletion endpoints in “function_call” mode, you can define a “function” that has the exact JSON schema you require, and the model will return arguments in a consistent JSON format.\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n3. EXAMPLE WITH OPENAI’S FUNCTION CALLING (OPTIONAL)\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n\nBelow is a rough example of how you might define a function call for structured JSON. (Adjust as needed for your environment.)\n\nExample:\n\nrequest = {\n  \"model\": \"gpt-4-0613\",\n  \"messages\": [\n    {\n      \"role\": \"system\",\n      \"content\": \"You are an assistant that returns JSON objects for a given summary request.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"role\": \"user\",\n      \"content\": \"Please summarize the text: 'OpenAI just released function calling.'\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"functions\": [\n    {\n      \"name\": \"generate_summary\",\n      \"description\": \"Generate a summary in JSON form\",\n      \"parameters\": {\n        \"type\": \"object\",\n        \"properties\": {\n          \"title\": {\"type\": \"string\"},\n          \"summary_points\": {\n            \"type\": \"array\",\n            \"items\": {\"type\": \"string\"}\n          }\n        },\n        \"required\": [\"title\", \"summary_points\"]\n      }\n    }\n  ],\n  \"function_call\": {\"name\": \"generate_summary\"}\n}\n\nresponse = openai.ChatCompletion.create(**request)\n\n# The returned response will have:\n# response[\"choices\"][0][\"message\"][\"function_call\"][\"arguments\"]\n# which should be valid JSON according to the schema.\n\nThen you can parse the arguments like:\nimport json\nargs = json.loads(response[\"choices\"][0][\"message\"][\"function_call\"][\"arguments\"])\n\n# `args` should look like:\n# {\n#   \"title\": \"Short Summary\",\n#   \"summary_points\": [\n#       \"OpenAI introduced function calling feature\",\n#       ...\n#   ]\n# }\n\nThis approach enforces the JSON structure with minimal guesswork.\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n4. TROUBLESHOOTING TIPS\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n\n• Make Prompts Self-Contained  \n  If your chain-of-thought or conversation references an earlier piece of data, ensure you pass that data (or a relevant excerpt) back to the model in a new prompt. Chat models do not automatically “remember” the entire conversation unless you include the prior context in the message history.  \n\n• Validate JSON After the Model Returns It  \n  Always parse the JSON in your application code with a standard parser (e.g., Python’s json.loads) or openai.response.parse. If you run into frequent invalid JSON, try reinforcing that requirement in your prompt or switch to function calling.  \n\n• Use “few-shot” Examples  \n  Sometimes, giving a direct example of the input → intermediate → final format (in your prompt) helps the model stay on track.  \n\n• If It Only Works with \"text:\" Output  \n  That typically suggests that the model is more strictly following instructions when forced into a “plain text” role. If you need raw JSON, highlight that in your instructions. Or use function calling, which is specifically built to solve these formatting issues.\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nSUMMARY\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n\nIn short, your approach of:\n1) Generating the first output,  \n2) Parsing/processing it, then  \n3) Feeding it back to the model for final JSON,\n\n…is a common and often effective chain of prompts. Make sure you pass the needed context from step A into step C. If the model is refusing to respect the JSON format (and only following instructions when asked for “text:”), try clarifying the prompt, providing a JSON schema example, or leveraging the function calling API for the cleanest JSON.\n\nIf you run into specific error messages or see inconsistent output, feel free to share those details, along with how you’re calling openai.response.parse. Then we can help troubleshoot more precisely.",

Which OpenAI API are you using—Chat Completions, Function Calling, or Tools?\n2. Are you trying to chain outputs (i.e., have one tool/function's output become the input for another step)?\n3. What is the exact issue when it doesn't work? Is the output not being parsed, is the tool not called, or is the schema wrong?\n4. What is the JSON schema you want as the final output?\n\n**General Advice:**\n\n- If you want the AI to consider previous tool outputs before producing a final output, you should ensure that the prior tool output is included in the prompt/context for the final completion.\n- In the OpenAI API, you can use function calling (now called \"tools\") to have the model call functions, whose outputs you then feed back as messages before the final completion.\n- If you're using openai.response.parse, make sure the function or tool outputs are added as assistant messages with the function_call and function_response roles, as per the OpenAI chat API schema.\n- To get a specific JSON schema, you can either:\n  - Define a function/tool with the desired output schema as parameters—this way, the model is forced to return output in that schema.\n  - Or, instruct the model in the prompt to output exactly in your desired JSON format.\n\n**If you provide:**\n- The schema you want\n- The steps/tools involved\n- A sample of your prompt or API call\n- The issue you're hitting\n\nI can give you more specific advice or code examples.\n\nFeel free to paste the rest of your message or clarify further!",

          "response": "It looks like you have a multi-step workflow where you:\n\n1) Use an “MCP server” in conjunction with the OpenAI API (specifically openai.response.parse).  \n2) Want the AI to generate an intermediate output.  \n3) Feed that intermediate output back into the AI so it can produce a final output in a specific JSON schema.\n\nYou also mentioned that it “works whenever I use text: format: ‘ … ”—which suggests there may be an issue with how you’re passing the prompt or how the AI output is being parsed when you include certain formatting or quotes.\n\nBelow are some tips and common pitfalls to check when chaining OpenAI outputs (especially if you must parse or re-inject them into a next step):\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n1. Avoid “Smart” or “Curly” Quotes in Prompts or JSON\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n• If your prompt or the AI’s output contains typographic (“curly”) quotes (like ‘ ’ or “ ”), many JSON parsers and libraries will choke on them, expecting straight quotes (').  \n• Be sure your code, prompt strings, or any generated JSON use either standard single quotes (') in places where JSON-escaped strings are allowed, or more commonly standard double quotes (\").  \n• For best results, instruct the model explicitly to avoid curly quotes. For example:\n  \n  \"When outputting JSON, please use straight quotes (') for keys or strings, and do not use curly quotes like ‘ or ’.\"\n\n─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n2. Use a Clear, Structured Prompt to Generate Valid JSON\n─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n• If you need the final output in a certain JSON schema, include a short open-ended request plus an explicit block explaining that the AI must produce valid JSON.  \n• For example, in your system or user prompt, you might say:\n\n  \"Please output your final reply strictly as valid JSON with the following schema:\n   {\n     'key1': '...',\n     'key2': {\n       'nestedKey': ...\n     }\n   }\n   Use straight double quotes for JSON. No extra keys or elements.\"\n\n• If you’re chaining steps, make sure the second step sees only the relevant portion of the first step’s output. For instance, parse out the relevant JSON object in your code, then feed just that data into the next prompt.\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n3. Validate or Post-Process the AI’s JSON Output\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n• Even if you instruct the model to produce JSON, it might still include extra commentary, code blocks, or stray text.  \n• Use your server-side logic (or openai.response.parse, if it supports it) to strip away extra text before re-injecting data into the next step.  \n• In many frameworks, you can do something like:\n\n  1) Capture the entire completion.  \n  2) Use a regex or a JSON-decoding approach to extract the first valid JSON object.  \n  3) If decoding fails, re-prompt or handle the error gracefully.\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n4. Preserve Intermediate Output for the Next Prompt\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n• If you want the AI to “consider” a previous step’s output, you can include it in the conversation context. For example:\n\n  System Message:  \n  \"You are a JSON generator. You only respond in valid JSON.\"\n\n  User Message:  \n  \"Here are the results from the previous step: {previousStepOutput}.  \n   Please use them to create a final JSON with the schema:\n   {\n     'approved': ...,\n     'explanations': ...\n   }\"\n\n• Another approach is to store the intermediate output in a variable and programmatically insert it into the next prompt. Just be sure that variable is valid JSON or a well-structured snippet of text.\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────\n5. Watch Out for Quotation Conflicts\n────────────────────────────────────────────\n• If you are embedding JSON inside JSON, you’ll often need to escape quotes carefully. For instance, if your JSON should contain strings that themselves contain JSON, you might need to do something like:\n\n  {\n    \"innerJson\": \"{\\\"key\\\": \\\"value\\\"}\"\n  }\n\n• If you try to paste raw JSON containing unescaped double quotes inside another JSON payload, you may end up breaking the entire structure.\n\n────────────────────────────────────────\n6. Example Prompt & Parsing Sequence\n────────────────────────────────────────\nBelow is a minimal illustration showing how you might handle two-step generation with strict JSON formats:\n\nSTEP 1: Generate Intermediate  \n--------------------------------\nprompt_step1 = \"\"\"\nYou are an assistant that outputs a JSON object with two fields: \"summary\" and \"score\".  \nOnly return valid JSON. Example:\n{\"summary\": \"…\", \"score\": 0}\n\"\"\"\n\nresponse_step1 = openai.ChatCompletion.create(\n  model=\"gpt-3.5-turbo\",\n  temperature=0,\n  messages=[{\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": prompt_step1}]\n)\n\n# Parse the JSON\nimport json\nintermediate_output = json.loads(response_step1[\"choices\"][0][\"message\"][\"content\"])\n\n# Now we have a dict like: {\"summary\": \"...\", \"score\": ...}\n\nSTEP 2: Use Intermediate Output to Produce Final JSON  \n-----------------------------------------------------\nsummary_text = intermediate_output[\"summary\"]\nscore_value = intermediate_output[\"score\"]\n\nprompt_step2 = f\"\"\"\nUse the following data in your reply:\nsummary: {summary_text}\nscore: {score_value}\n\nNow produce a final JSON with the keys \"analysis\" and \"decision\".  \nOnly return valid JSON, no extra text.\n\"\"\"\n\nresponse_step2 = openai.ChatCompletion.create(\n  model=\"gpt-3.5-turbo\",\n  temperature=0,\n  messages=[{\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": prompt_step2}]\n)\n\nfinal_output = json.loads(response_step2[\"choices\"][0][\"message\"][\"content\"])\n\n• Notice how in each step, we instruct the AI to produce valid JSON, parse the result, and then feed the relevant fields into the next prompt.  \n\n────────────────────────────────────────\n\nWith these guidelines (especially being careful about quotes and formatting), you should be able to have the model produce or transform intermediate JSON reliably. If you still see issues—like parse errors, curly quotes, or extra text—make the instructions about JSON output more explicit, and add validations or fallback logic in your code.  \n\nI hope this clarifies why “it works whenever I use text: format: ‘ … ” (very likely due to quotes or formatting differences) and how to make it more reliable. If you continue seeing odd behaviors or parse errors, double-check that your prompts and the AI’s output are using only standard quotes and that you are indeed stripping out any extra text or tokens before reusing the output.",

It sounds like you're working on integrating an MCP server with OpenAI's API and want to use tool outputs as additional context before generating a final response in a specific JSON schema.\n\nFrom your message, I gather:\n\n- You're invoking a tool (possibly via OpenAI's function calling or tools API).\n- You want the AI to incorporate the tool's output into its final response.\n- The final output should adhere to a certain JSON schema.\n- It works when you use text: format: ' (your message got cut off here).\n\nTo help you further, let me outline a general approach and address common pitfalls:\n\n## General Approach\n\n1. **Request Flow:**\n   - User provides input (via MCP server).\n   - Input (and possibly context) sent to OpenAI API, specifying a tool/function.\n   - OpenAI responds with a function_call (tool call) in the response.\n   - You execute the tool, get its result, and send that back to OpenAI as part of the conversation.\n   - You request a final response (in your JSON schema), with the tool output considered as context.\n\n2. **Ensuring Tool Output is Considered:**\n   - When sending the tool's output back to OpenAI, include it as a new message in the conversation history, typically as a function or tool message, e.g.:\n     ```json\n     {\n       \"role\": \"tool\",\n       \"name\": \"your_tool_name\",\n       \"content\": \"tool output here\"\n     }\n     ```\n   - Then ask the model for a response, specifying that it must use the tool output.\n\n3. **Forcing JSON Output:**\n   - In your system prompt, instruct the model to ONLY output a response in the required JSON schema.\n   - Example:\n     ```\n     You must summarize the tool output and user question in the following JSON format:\n     {\n       \"result\": string,\n       \"confidence\": number\n     }\n     Only output a valid JSON, do not include any extra text.\n     ```\n   - You can use the response_format parameter in OpenAI's API (if supported with your model) to enforce JSON output, e.g.:\n     ```json\n     \"response_format\": { \"type\": \"json_object\" }\n     ```\n\n## Common Issues\n\n- **Model ignores tool output:** Make sure you include the tool output message directly in the conversation history before the AI's turn to answer.\n- **Model outputs text instead of JSON:** Use system prompts and response_format to enforce JSON output.\n- **Parsing errors:** If using openai.response.parse, ensure the model's output is strictly valid JSON (no preamble, no trailing text).\n\n## Example Conversation Structure\n\n```json\n[\n  { \"role\": \"system\", \"content\": \"You are an assistant...\" },\n  { \"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"Please process XYZ.\" },\n  { \"role\": \"assistant\", \"content\": null, \"function_call\": { \"name\": \"my_tool\", \"arguments\": \"{...}\" } },\n  { \"role\": \"tool\", \"name\": \"my_tool\", \"content\": \"Tool output: Success, value=42\" },\n  { \"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"Now summarize the results as JSON.\" }\n]\n```\nThen, instruct the model to only output the required JSON.\n\n## If you use text: format: '\n\nYour question got cut off. If you clarify what you meant by \"It works whenever I use text: format: '\", I can provide more targeted help.\n\n---\n\n**If you provide:**\n- The exact JSON schema you want\n- A sample input\n- The tool output\n- The full prompt/flow\n\nI can give you a working prompt or code example tailored to your case!\n\nLet me know if you want a concrete code example (Node.js, Python, etc.) or if you have a sample schema.",

          "response": "Below is a general outline of how you could structure a two-phase (or multi-phase) approach using an MCP server, OpenAI’s API, and openai.response.parse (assuming you mean the Response Parser from OpenAI’s developer ecosystem or a similar utility). The goal is to:\n\n1. First, collect or generate some necessary data (“tool output”).  \n2. Then, feed that data—alongside any other instructions—back to the AI so it can produce a final JSON response with a specific schema.\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n1. Overview of the Approach\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n\na) Phase 1: Get the “tool output.”\n   • You have an MCP server or a separate process that obtains or calculates some relevant data.  \n   • Store or format this data in a way that you can pass it into the AI prompt later—perhaps as a JSON snippet, or as a direct text string.\n\nb) Phase 2: Prompt the AI with the “tool output” plus the desired instruction for the final output schema.\n   • Use a carefully constructed system or user message to embed your “tool output.”  \n   • Tell the AI exactly how to use that output when formatting the final response.\n\nc) Parsing / Checking the Response:\n   • Use openai.response.parse or whichever tool you prefer to ensure the final result is valid JSON and/or meets your schema requirements.\n\nBelow, each section goes into more detail to illustrate these steps.\n\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n2. Detailed Steps\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n\nPHASE 1: Get the “Tool Output”\n───────────────────────────────\n\n1. MCP Server Operation (the “tool”):\n   • Suppose your MCP server runs some commands, queries a database, or performs transformations. \n   • Eventually it returns a value or object—e.g., “tool output” of interest.\n\n2. Store or Format the Output:\n   • You might convert the MCP server’s response into a JSON string, or store it as an environment variable, or even embed it within a message field—depending on how your application handles the chain of data.\n   • Example of a stored output (a simple JSON structure):  \n     {\n       \"toolResult\": {\n         \"summary\": \"We found x, y, z from the data\",\n         \"metadata\": { \"count\": 42, \"sampling\": \"random\" }\n       }\n     }\n   • Or just store it as text if that is more direct for your usage.\n\n\nPHASE 2: Send Tool Output + Instructions to OpenAI\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n\n1. Construct Your Prompt:\n   • You can use OpenAI’s ChatCompletion or a similar method (depending on the model) and pass a system or user message that includes:\n     – The “tool output” context.  \n     – Instructions about how to produce the final JSON schema.  \n   • Example prompt structure:\n\n   [System message]\n   \"\"\"\n   You are a helpful assistant. You have access to the following data from a tool:\n   {toolOutput}\n   \n   Please use this data to produce the final result in JSON format, according to this schema:\n   {\n     \"finalSummary\": string,\n     \"metadata\": {\n       \"count\": number,\n       \"otherDetails\": string\n     }\n   }\n   Important: ensure your answer is strictly in valid JSON only, with no additional keys.\n   \"\"\"\n\n2. Use text-based format or direct JSON:\n   • If you have trouble with “function calling” or your system’s equivalent, a straightforward way is to literally embed the instructions in a system or user message, as shown above. This is likely what you mean by “whenever I use text: format, it works.”  \n   • If you are using function-based calls or advanced JSON schema calls in the OpenAI system, you’ll need to ensure that your request is properly structured so the model is guided to produce valid JSON. In many cases, you might define a function with parameters that represent each field in your final JSON.\n\n3. Validate the Response with openai.response.parse:\n   • After the AI responds, parse or validate it with the parser.  \n   • If the parser fails (e.g., the AI output is not valid JSON), you can implement a retry mechanism—resending a clarifying instruction or just letting the chain logic handle it.  \n\n4. Example Minimal Code Flow (Pseudocode):\n\n   ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n   # Pseudocode for a ChatCompletion with a “two-phase” approach:\n\n   # PHASE 1: Obtain data from MCP server\n   mcp_data = run_mcp_server_command(...)\n   # e.g. mcp_data = { \"summary\": \"We found x, y, z\", \"metadata\": {...} }\n\n   # Have AI produce final JSON output\n   system_prompt = f\"\"\"\n   You have data from the MCP server:\n   {mcp_data}\n\n   Produce a JSON object with this schema:\n   {{\n       \"finalSummary\": string,\n       \"metadata\": {{\n           \"count\": number,\n           \"otherDetails\": string\n       }}\n   }}\n   - Only output valid JSON, nothing else.\n   \"\"\"\n\n   completion = openai.ChatCompletion.create(\n       model=\"gpt-4\",  # or whichever model\n       messages=[{\"role\": \"system\", \"content\": system_prompt}],\n       # If you prefer the standard text-based approach, you won't define a function_call here.\n   )\n\n   # Now parse the response\n   result_json = openai.response.parse(completion)  # or your own custom JSON parser\n\n   # Then you can work with result_json[\"finalSummary\"], result_json[\"metadata\"], etc.\n   ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n\n5. Consider Using “function_call” (Optional, if you prefer newer patterns):\n   • With new OpenAI function calling, you can define a function with a JSON schema. Then, the model can output arguments for that function (the function arguments must be valid JSON).  \n   • If you are already comfortable with the text-based approach, you might not need to add function calling.  \n\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n3. Common Pitfalls and Tips\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n\n• Ensuring Valid JSON:\n  – Sometimes models may add extra commentary or formatting around JSON. Reinforce in the prompt: “Only output valid JSON. No extra text.”  \n  – If you still receive invalid JSON, add more constraints in the system message or use function calling, which effectively forces JSON compliance.\n\n• Large Tool Output:\n  – If the MCP server output is large, you might need to chunk it or carefully handle token limits.  \n  – Summarizing or providing partial context might help reduce token usage.\n\n• Using openai.response.parse:\n  – If openai.response.parse is a helper that attempts to parse the response into JSON, handle exceptions properly. The model might produce malformed JSON in some cases.\n\n• Testing Step by Step:\n  – When introducing the second step, confirm that your prompt indeed contains the first step’s output from the tool.  \n  – Keep an eye on your system vs. user vs. assistant messages. Make sure the final instructions to produce JSON are well localized so the model “understands” them.\n\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n4. Summary\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n\nIn short:  \n1. Gather or generate data from your MCP server (“tool output”).  \n2. Pass that output into the prompt or function call where you specify the final JSON schema with an explicit instruction.  \n3. Use openai.response.parse or a similar method to validate the final JSON.  \n\nWhen done consistently, you’ll have a two-phase pipeline: the first step captures data, and the second step instructs the model to consume that data and output valid JSON. This approach is typically quite effective, and it aligns well with how the GPT models handle instructions plus external context.\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n\nI hope this helps clarify the general method for having the AI “consider” intermediate output before producing a final JSON response. Let me know if there is any specific scenario or code snippet you’d like more detail on!",

          "response": "Based on what you’ve described, it sounds like you’re aiming for a two‐phase process where:\n\n1. First, you call your MCP server (using the tool or a “tool call” in your prompt) to generate an intermediate output.\n2. Then you have the OpenAI API use that intermediate output as context so that the final answer is produced in a specific JSON schema—by parsing and reusing the text from the first step.\n\nA general approach to this workflow is as follows:\n\n• Stage 1: Tool/Intermediate Output  \n – In your prompt (or via a function call mechanism), ask the assistant to produce some text (or structured data) using your MCP server’s functionality.  \n – When you use a text: format (e.g., text: \"…\") the model’s response is formatted as plain text.  \n – You then pass that output through openai.response.parse to convert it (or validate it) to a JSON or structured intermediate format.\n\n• Stage 2: Final Output Using the Intermediate Result  \n – Once you have the intermediate structured output, include it as context in a second call or a follow‐up prompt.  \n – In that prompt, instruct the assistant to consider the MCP server’s output (perhaps by quoting it, summarizing it, or embedding it in the prompt) and then generate the final response strictly adhering to your JSON schema.  \n – By being explicit in the prompt—“Based on the output from the MCP server [insert output here], generate a final answer that follows the JSON schema:”—you help guide the model to integrate the earlier result.\n\nSome practical tips:\n\n1. If you’re using the openai.response.parse utility, confirm that the text returned from step 1 is indeed in a format you expect. You might have to add instructions such as “output in the following format…” to ensure compatibility.\n\n2. Consider whether the tool call (your MCP server call) is synchronous or asynchronous. In some cases you may need to make a first API call to get the tool’s result, then in a separate call include that result. Alternatively, if you’re chaining the calls within a single prompt (for instance via function-calling workflows) confirm that your instructions are clear.\n\n3. If you notice any inconsistency (for example, if you get valid output when using text: format but a different behavior otherwise), double-check how the prompt is structured and whether the openai.response.parse function is correctly applied after the tool output is generated.\n\n4. If your final JSON is critical (i.e., you need it to strictly follow the JSON schema), you might also implement a post-processing step (or validation) before using the output in your application. Sometimes, even with clear instructions, the generated output may require an additional pass to clean up formatting.\n\nOverall, the strategy is to break down the process into:\n\n Step A. Generate intermediate output (with the tool) and parse it as needed.\n Step B. Supply that parsed output in context to instruct the assistant for a final, well-formatted JSON output.\n\nBy explicitly “feeding” the output back into the prompt of the second API call (or the second part of your chain-of-thought), you condition the model to incorporate that data. This should work reliably when your prompts are clear and your tooling (both on the MCP server side and for openai.response.parse) manages the intermediate formatting.\n\nIf you have more details—such as sample prompts, the nature of the MCP output, or any errors you’re encountering—it might be possible to provide more specific guidance. But in general, the above chain-of-calls approach is how you would integrate an MCP server’s intermediate output with a final JSON output via the OpenAI API.",

          "response": "Absolutely, let's clarify your setup and help troubleshoot the issue.\n\nFrom your description:\n\n- You have an MCP server.\n- You're interfacing with the OpenAI API, specifically using function calling (tools).\n- You're using openai.response.parse to process responses.\n- You want to send a tool/function call, get its output, then have the AI consider that tool output before producing a final response in a specific JSON schema.\n- It works when you use text: format but not when you use tools/function calls.\n\nSome clarifying questions and suggestions:\n\n### 1. Multi-Step Function Calling in OpenAI API\n\nOpenAI's function calling allows chaining steps, but the orchestration logic (to feed tool outputs back to the model and get the final structured output) is up to your code. The model is stateless between calls—you must maintain the conversation and results.\n\n### 2. Typical Flow\n\n1. User message.\n2. Model suggests a function/tool call.\n3. Your server executes the tool, gets the result.\n4. You send the tool result back to the model as a message of type 'tool' or 'function'.\n5. The model then produces a final answer (which can be in JSON format if you instruct it so).\n\n### 3. Problem: Only Works with text: format\n\nThis suggests that when you use plain completion mode (text format), the model can see all context and produce the correct JSON. However, when using tools, you may not be feeding the tool output back correctly, or the schema/format isn’t being enforced.\n\n### 4. Tips & Example\n\n#### Example Message Sequence\n\n```json\n[\n  {\"role\": \"system\", \"content\": \"You are an assistant that produces output in this JSON schema: { ... }\"},\n  {\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"Get info about X and summarize it.\"},\n  {\"role\": \"assistant\", \"content\": null, \"function_call\": {\"name\": \"get_info\", \"arguments\": \"{\\\"topic\\\": \\\"X\\\"}\"}},\n  {\"role\": \"function\", \"name\": \"get_info\", \"content\": \"{\\\"info\\\": \\\"...\\\"}\"}\n]\n```\n\nAfter the function output, you call the OpenAI API again with the conversation above, and the model will now generate a response considering the function output.\n\n#### Key Points\n\n- Ensure you pass the function/tool output as a message with role: function (or tool), including its name and content, before asking for the final model response.\n- When you want a specific JSON schema, remind the model in the system prompt and/or user message.\n- If you want the final response in a certain schema, you can use response_format={\"type\": \"json_object\"} (for GPT-4 models that support it).\n\n### 5. Troubleshooting Steps\n\n- Double-check that after the tool call, you send a follow-up API call with the updated message list, including the tool's output.\n- Make sure you are not skipping the step where the model \"reflects\" on the tool output.\n- Check that your schema and instructions are clear and present in system/user messages.\n- If your MCP server or openai.response.parse abstraction is interfering, try a raw API call to isolate the issue.\n\n### 6. Example Python Code (Pseudo)\n\n```python\n# Step 1: Send user message, get tool call\nresponse = openai.ChatCompletion.create(\n    model=\"gpt-4-1106-preview\",\n    messages=[\n        {\"role\": \"system\", \"content\": \"You must reply in this JSON schema: {...}\"},\n        {\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"Get info about X and summarize it.\"}\n    ],\n    tools=[...]\n)\n# Step 2: Execute tool, get result\ntool_output = my_tool(\"X\")\n# Step 3: Send tool result back\nresponse2 = openai.ChatCompletion.create(\n    model=\"gpt-4-1106-preview\",\n    messages=[\n        {\"role\": \"system\", \"content\": \"You must reply in this JSON schema: {...}\"},\n        {\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"Get info about X and summarize it.\"},\n        {\"role\": \"assistant\", \"content\": None, \"tool_call_id\": ..., \"tool_call\": ...},\n        {\"role\": \"tool\", \"content\": tool_output, \"tool_call_id\": ...}\n    ]\n)\n# Now response2['choices'][0]['message']['content'] should be your final output in the schema.\n```\n\n### 7. If Still Stuck\n\n- Share a sample of your code and the message sequence you send.\n- Check the OpenAI function calling docs: https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/function-calling\n- The openai.response.parse utility may be specific to your library—ensure it correctly parses tool outputs and sequences.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nYou must pass the tool output back to the model as a new message, then ask for the final output in the desired schema. The orchestration (multi-step process) is your responsibility. If you only get the right result in text mode, it suggests the tool output is not being properly included in the model's context before the final output is generated.\n\nIf you share your message sequence and code, I can provide more specific help!",

          "response": "Below is a general pattern you can use when chaining “tool” output together with a final JSON response. The key steps are:\n\n1) Call your tool (or MCP server) to get some intermediate output.  \n2) Pass that output—as context—into your OpenAI request along with instructions to produce a final JSON of a specific schema.  \n3) Make sure your system or user instructions clarify exactly how you expect the model to format its final answer (so that openai.response.parse can reliably parse it).\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n1) Get the Tool (MCP) Output\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n\nSuppose you have a function get_tool_output() that queries your MCP server and returns a string with the tool’s data:\n\ntool_output = get_tool_output()  \n# e.g., tool_output is \"The best approach is to focus on X, Y, Z\"\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n2) Include Tool Output as Context\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n\nNext, you feed that tool_output into your ChatCompletion call, making it clear the model should keep that content in mind before responding. For clarity, you can add it in a “system” or “assistant” role message, or pass it however your conversation flow is structured. For instance:\n\nmessages = [\n    {\n        \"role\": \"system\",\n        \"content\": (\n            \"You are a helpful AI assistant. You have received the following \"\n            f\"tool result:\\n\\n{tool_output}\\n\\n\"\n            \"Use this information when producing your final answer.\"\n        )\n    },\n    {\n        \"role\": \"user\",\n        \"content\": (\n            \"Please produce your final conclusion in valid JSON under this \"\n            \"schema:\\n\\n\"\n            \"  {\\n\"\n            \"    \\\"summary\\\": string,\\n\"\n            \"    \\\"recommendation\\\": string\\n\"\n            \"  }\\n\\n\"\n            \"No additional keys should be added. Return only valid JSON.\"\n        )\n    }\n]\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n3) Request JSON-Only Output\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n\nOne way to ensure the model returns valid JSON is to be explicit that you want JSON only—no extra text. For older Completions endpoints, it often helps to remind the model not to include code fences or additional commentary. For ChatCompletions with function-calling, you can define a function schema that matches your desired JSON structure. But if you’re simply prompting in text mode:\n\nmessages = [\n    {\n        \"role\": \"system\",\n        \"content\": (\n            \"You are a helpful AI assistant. You have received the following \"\n            f\"tool result:\\n\\n{tool_output}\\n\\n\"\n            \"Use it to inform your final answer.\"\n        )\n    },\n    {\n        \"role\": \"user\",\n        \"content\": (\n            \"Return the final answer as strict JSON in this schema:\\n\\n\"\n            \"{\\n\"\n            \"  \\\"summary\\\": string,\\n\"\n            \"  \\\"recommendation\\\": string\\n\"\n            \"}\\n\\n\"\n            \"No markdown, no extra text—JSON only.\"\n        )\n    }\n]\n\nresponse = openai.ChatCompletion.create(\n    model=\"gpt-3.5-turbo\",\n    messages=messages,\n    temperature=0\n)\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n4) Parsing the JSON\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n\nIf you are using something like openai.response.parse (or a similar parser), it will often expect either:\n\n• A response that strictly contains JSON (no extra text).  \n• Potentially a function call–style response if you’re leveraging function calling.\n\nIf you see parsing errors, it usually means the model’s response included something besides JSON (like leading text, code fences, or an apology/explanation). To minimize that:\n\n• Explicitly instruct the model: “Return only JSON. No extra text.”  \n• If you still get extra text, try adding more instructions to strip out any disclaimers (“Do not include any commentary” etc.).  \n• Use a structured approach (like the function calling mode) where you define the JSON schema in the function parameters, and the model must respond in that function call format.\n\nExample of manual parsing if you used a pure text response:\n\nraw_text = response[\"choices\"][0][\"message\"][\"content\"]\n\nimport json\ntry:\n    final_data = json.loads(raw_text)\n    # final_data is now a Python dict with \"summary\" and \"recommendation\"\nexcept json.JSONDecodeError as e:\n    # handle malformed JSON\n    print(\"JSON parse error:\", e)\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n5) Debugging Common Pitfalls\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n\n• “It works in text: format but not JSON”: Often this is because the model is injecting extra text, code blocks, or partial syntax. Strict instructions (“Return only valid JSON—no code fences.”) generally fix it.  \n• If you’re mixing tool responses and final output, confirm you’re not inadvertently including quotes or backticks from the tool output that break JSON. Sanitize or wrap the tool output to avoid unescaped characters.  \n• For best reliability, consider the official function calling approach, where you specify a function name and parameters. That tends to produce well-formed JSON that’s easy to parse automatically.\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n\nPutting it all together:\n\n1. Call your tool → get_tool_output().  \n2. Feed that into your ChatCompletion with explicit instructions for the JSON schema.  \n3. Use openai.response.parse (or json.loads on the content) to parse.  \n4. If your results include extraneous text, tighten your instructions and/or use the function call feature.  \n\nThat should let you chain your MCP server output into the final JSON response reliably.",

Could you please clarify or complete your question?\n\nFrom what I understand so far:\n\n- You have an MCP server.\n- You are using the OpenAI responses API, specifically openai.response.parse.\n- You want to use a tool/function to get an intermediate output, then have the AI consider that output before producing a final output in a specific JSON schema.\n- It works when you use text: format: ‘...’ (but your message was incomplete after this).\n\nSome questions and suggestions to help you further:\n\n1. **Are you using OpenAI's function calling or tool calling features?**\n   - If so, you usually define a schema for the tool function, get a function/tool response, and then want the model to use that result for a final output.\n\n2. **Are you chaining calls, or trying to do this in a single prompt?**\n   - If you want the model to \"consider\" a tool output before producing a final response, you typically need to structure your messages accordingly. For example, in the OpenAI API you might:\n     - Send the user message.\n     - The model chooses a tool/function to call.\n     - Your code parses the tool/function response and appends it to the conversation.\n     - The model receives the tool response and produces a final answer.\n\n3. **What is the issue when you use the JSON schema?**\n   - Does the model not follow the schema?\n   - Are you having trouble getting the intermediate output to be considered in the final output?\n\n4. **Can you share a code snippet or example of what you are sending to the API and what responses you are getting?**\n\nIf you can clarify these points or provide the rest of your message, I can give you a more precise solution, including code examples if needed.\n\n**General Example (OpenAI function calling flow):**\n\n```python\nimport openai\n\n# 1. Define your function/tool schema\ntools = [{\n    \"type\": \"function\",\n    \"function\": {\n        \"name\": \"get_intermediate_output\",\n        \"description\": \"Gets preliminary data before final answer.\",\n        \"parameters\": {\n            \"type\": \"object\",\n            \"properties\": {\n                \"query\": {\"type\": \"string\"}\n            },\n            \"required\": [\"query\"]\n        }\n    }\n}]\n\n# 2. Send user message\nmessages = [\n    {\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"I need the processed output for X in this schema...\"}\n]\n\n# 3. Create ChatCompletion with tools\nresponse = openai.ChatCompletion.create(\n    model=\"gpt-4-0613\",\n    messages=messages,\n    tools=tools,\n    tool_choice=\"auto\"\n)\n\n# 4.

Below are some general recommendations and patterns you might follow. If you can share more code specifics or error details, I can give more targeted guidance.\n\n1) Understand the Flow You Want to Achieve:\n   • Step 1: You send a request to your MCP server (or some other data source) and get a response, let’s call it “intermediateOutput”.\n   • Step 2: You want to feed “intermediateOutput” back to the OpenAI API so that the model can consider that data in its final response.\n   • Step 3: You want the model’s final response in your specified JSON schema.\n\n2) Typical Outline with openai.response.parse:\n   a) Provide your instructions to the model, for example:\n      - “Use the following data (intermediateOutput) to assist with your final answer.”\n      - “Then respond in a JSON format like { 'field1': '...', 'field2': '...' }.”\n   b) Directly embed “intermediateOutput” into the system prompt or user prompt (depending on your design).\n   c) Use openai.response.parse (depending on your environment or library) to parse the result. For instance, if you’re using some of the newer ChatCompletion features, you might do something like:\n\n      messages = [\n          {\n              \"role\": \"system\",\n              \"content\": \"You are provided with some data. Use strictly the provided schema in your final message.\"\n          },\n          {\n              \"role\": \"user\",\n              \"content\": (\n                  f\"Here is the output from the MCP server:\\n{intermediateOutput}\\n\"\n                  \"Now please provide a response in the JSON schema: \"\n                  \"{\\\"field1\\\": \\\"string\\\", \\\"field2\\\": \\\"string or number\\\"}.\\n\"\n              )\n          }\n      ]\n\n      response = openai.ChatCompletion.create(\n          model=\"gpt-3.5-turbo\",\n          messages=messages,\n          temperature=0,\n          # Possibly add function calling or other specialized usage here\n      )\n\n      # Then parse the data as needed\n      parsed_response = openai.response.parse(response)\n\n3) Ensuring the Model Adheres to JSON:\n   • One common issue is that the model sometimes includes extra text or formatting around the JSON. You can reduce that likelihood by:\n     – Using a system message that says something like: “You will be given data. Only output valid JSON. Do not include code fences, or any additional explanation.”\n     – Adding specific instructions in the user message such as: “Your response must be valid JSON. Do not include any extra keys other than (field1, field2).”\n   • If the model returns invalid JSON (extra text, code blocks, etc.), try specifying again in the prompt to not include extra text, from either the user or system instructions.\n\n4) Potential Debugging Steps:\n   a) If you’re seeing no output, it could be:\n      – The request is malformed (e.g., incorrect property names for the OpenAI request).\n      – The model is returning an error or empty message if your instructions are contradictory or incomplete.\n   b) If the output is not valid JSON:\n      – Reinforce your system or user message that the output must be valid JSON, and mention only the necessary keys.\n   c) If you’re getting an error when you parse the response:\n      – The parser might be looking for a certain format. Sometimes the raw text is not strictly valid JSON. Double-check the output string in logs or debugging prints.\n\n5) Consider “Function Calling” in Chat Completions (If Using GPT-4 or GPT-3.5-Turbo):\n   • If you have access to the recent function-calling feature, you can define a function schema that matches the JSON structure you desire and let the model “call” that function. This ensures your final output can be more reliably extracted in JSON format:\n        \"functions\": [\n            {\n                \"name\": \"finalAnswer\",\n                \"description\": \"Provide the final answer in a structured JSON format\",\n                \"parameters\": {\n                    \"type\": \"object\",\n                    \"properties\": {\n                        \"field1\": {\"type\": \"string\"},\n                        \"field2\": {\"type\": \"string\"}\n                    },\n                    \"required\": [\"field1\", \"field2\"]\n                }\n            }\n        ]\n   • Then instruct the model to gather the “intermediateOutput” into that function call. The returned message will contain a JSON object that your code can parse directly without the risk of extraneous text.\n\n6) Putting It All Together:\n   1. Make a request to MCP server or any preliminary step. Retrieve “intermediateOutput”.\n   2. In your ChatCompletion request, supply both the user/system prompt that includes “intermediateOutput” and the schema you need.\n   3. Optionally, use function calling if you have access to that feature. Otherwise, rely on carefully crafted prompts.\n   4. Ensure your code that parses the response is set up properly (e.g., openai.response.parse usage) and you’re handling any possible string or JSON parsing errors.\n\nBy following the above outline—particularly focusing on how to incorporate the intermediate output neatly into the prompt and instructing the model to produce strictly JSON—you should be able to get the structured data you want. If you have more details (like sample code or a specific example of the prompts you’re using), feel free to share so I can help troubleshoot further.",

You’re using openai.response.parse to grab that output (using, for example, a command with text: format) so the AI can “see” it.  \n3. Then you want the AI to use that output as context before finally returning a JSON object that conforms to a certain schema.\n\nYou mentioned that everything works as expected when you use a text: format. Does that mean that when you pass the MCP output as plain text it successfully gets considered in the final JSON? And are you finding issues when you try to use another format (perhaps something like raw JSON) or when you try to combine the parsed tool output with your final response?\n\nA few points that might help narrow down the issue:\n\n• Chain of operations:  \n – First, you get the MCP output (using text: format when calling openai.response.parse).  \n – Next, you include that output (or its parsed version) in the prompt for generating the final JSON response.\n\nMake sure that the prompt context includes that intermediate result clearly (e.g., “Given the following output from the MCP server: …, please produce a final JSON conforming to … schema”).\n\n• Formatting issues:  \n – If you’re switching from text: to another format (or if the MCP output is not pure text), the parser might not be handling it as expected.  \n – When using text: format everything works—this indicates that the intermediate step is functioning when the output is stringified.  \n – If you try to pass in a non-text format or perhaps an already formatted JSON snippet, the parser might not “see” it in the way you intend.\n\n• Order of operations and context:  \n – Ensure that the AI has access to both the raw output and the instructions for the target JSON schema in its system or user messages.  \n – Sometimes it is useful to combine the outputs explicitly. For example, you might structure your prompt like:  \n  \"Here is the MCP server output: <output from MCP>  \n  Now, using that data, produce a final JSON response that follows this schema: { … }\"\n\nIf you could provide a sample of your prompt (or pseudo-code of your implementation) and the exact behavior you’re experiencing when not using text: format, I can give you more targeted advice.\n\nIn summary, the reason it works with text: format is because the AI is reliably receiving and parsing a simple string. When you change the format or try to pass along structured data directly, you might be running into issues with how the parser expects input. Let me know if this helps or please share additional details (like example code or error messages), and we can dive deeper into a solution.",

Not formatting as JSON?), I can give more targeted help or example code.**\n\nLet me know where you want to dig deeper!",

          "response": "Below is a general outline of how you can have the model (1) call a “tool” (or otherwise obtain an intermediate result), and then (2) consider that tool’s output before producing a final JSON-formatted result. The examples assume a Node.js setup, but the same principles apply in Python or other languages.\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n1) High-Level Overview\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n• You (the developer) send a prompt to the model containing:\n  – A request for the model to call a “tool” if needed and fetch some data (this could be a database query, a call to an external API, etc.).  \n  – Context or instructions telling the model that after it uses the tool, it should produce a final JSON object with specific fields.\n\n• Your code then:\n  1. Reads the partial response from the model (which might indicate it wants to call a tool).  \n  2. Executes the tool.  \n  3. Passes the tool’s output back into the conversation for the model to consider.  \n  4. The model then returns a final response in valid JSON that you parse for your downstream application logic.\n\nNote: The exact approach can vary depending on whether you’re using:\n• The new “function calling” approach in the OpenAI API.  \n• A custom “tools + AI” orchestration library (some people call this a “ChatGPT agent”—various open-source libraries exist).  \n• A manual approach where you intercept the model’s response to see if it’s calling a tool.\n\nBelow is a more manual approach that many developers implement if not using specialized function-calling features.\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n2) Example Prompt + Tool Flow (Manual Approach)\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n\nLet’s pretend you want the model to first call a “mockTool” that returns some data from an external source. Then, once the tool’s output is retrieved, you want the model to finalize its answer in a particular JSON schema.\n\nStep-by-step:\n\n1. You send a system (or user) message instructing the model about the overall workflow.  \n2. When the model wants the output from a tool, it “requests” it in a special format (often you can just parse the text and detect if it wants to call the tool).  \n3. Your application sees that the model is asking for tool output, calls the tool, then passes that tool output back to the model.  \n4. Finally, you instruct the model: “Now incorporate the tool’s output into a final JSON with keys: { ... }.”  \n5. The model responds in valid JSON. You parse that JSON in your code (e.g., JSON.parse(...) in Node.js).\n\nBelow is a brief illustration using Node.js pseudo-code.\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n3) Node.js Pseudo-Code\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n\nconst { Configuration, OpenAIApi } = require(\"openai\");\n\nconst configuration = new Configuration({\n  apiKey: process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY,\n});\nconst openai = new OpenAIApi(configuration);\n\n/**\n * 1. Start with an initial prompt telling the model it can request data from a \"tool\"\n *    and that the final output must be in JSON format once it's done.\n */\nasync function runWorkflow() {\n  let conversationHistory = [\n    {\n      role: \"system\",\n      content: `\nYou are a helpful assistant. \nYou have access to a tool called 'mockTool'. \nWhen you need data from this tool, you must respond exactly in the format:\n  [TOOL_CALL] mockTool: { \"query\": \"...\" }\n\nAfter you receive the data from the tool, output a final JSON in this schema:\n{\n  \"status\": string,\n  \"result\": string\n}\n`\n    },\n    {\n      role: \"user\",\n      content: \"Please find out the name of the top-visited website for me and then return it in the final JSON.\"\n    }\n  ];\n\n  // 2. Send the prompt. Possibly the model requests the tool first.\n  let response = await openai.createChatCompletion({\n    model: \"gpt-3.5-turbo\",\n    messages: conversationHistory\n  });\n\n  let assistantMessage = response.data.choices[0].message.content;\n\n  // 3. Check if the assistant is requesting a tool call. \n  //    For illustration, let’s assume the assistant returns something like:\n  //\n  //    [TOOL_CALL] mockTool: {\"query\": \"top website\"}\n  //\n  //    so we detect \"[TOOL_CALL] mockTool:\" as the trigger.\n  //\n  // (In reality, you might do robust parsing or use a streaming approach.)\n  if (assistantMessage.startsWith('[TOOL_CALL] mockTool:')) {\n    // Extract JSON after the colon, e.g. {\"query\":\"top website\"}\n    // Then call your \"mockTool\"\n    const regex = /\\[TOOL_CALL\\]\\s*mockTool:\\s*(\\{.*\\})/;\n    const match = assistantMessage.match(regex);\n    if (match) {\n      let toolPayloadStr = match[1];\n      let toolPayload = JSON.parse(toolPayloadStr);\n      \n      // 4. Execute the tool. This is your “MCP server call,” API, or any external function.\n      //    For demonstration, we’ll just return a hard-coded string.\n      const toolOutput = mockTool(toolPayload.query);\n\n      // 5. Now pass the tool output back into the conversation with an instruction.\n      conversationHistory.push({\n        role: \"assistant\",\n        content: assistantMessage\n      });\n      conversationHistory.push({\n        role: \"user\",\n        content: `Here's the result from mockTool: ${toolOutput}`\n      });\n\n      // 6. Ask the assistant to provide the final JSON using that tool output.\n      //    Because you’ve set up the system message to ask for JSON in a certain schema,\n      //    it should comply. You can add a clarifying user/system message to “Please return valid JSON now.”\n      conversationHistory.push({\n        role: \"user\",\n        content: \"Now produce the final JSON as specified.\"\n      });\n\n      response = await openai.createChatCompletion({\n        model: \"gpt-3.5-turbo\",\n        messages: conversationHistory\n      });\n\n      assistantMessage = response.data.choices[0].message.content;\n    }\n  }\n\n  // 7. At this point, the assistantMessage should (hopefully) be valid JSON in the required schema.\n  //    You can parse with JSON.parse(...) to confirm.\n  let finalJSON;\n  try {\n    finalJSON = JSON.parse(assistantMessage);\n  } catch (e) {\n    console.error(\"Failed to parse JSON:\", e, assistantMessage);\n    return;\n  }\n\n  console.log(\"Assistant final JSON:\", finalJSON);\n  // done!\n}\n\nfunction mockTool(query) {\n  // In a real scenario, you'd do your external calls or data lookups here.\n  // Return a realistic result for demonstration.\n  if (query === \"top website\") {\n    return \"Google.com\";\n  }\n  return \"Unknown\";\n}\n\nrunWorkflow();\n\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n4) Handling “format” Issues\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nYou mentioned: “It works whenever I use text: format: ‘…’” but not otherwise. Common pitfalls include:\n\n• The model fails to wrap the final output strictly in valid JSON because it’s adding extra text or commentary.  \n• The model might insert backticks or code fences, which then break JSON parsing.  \n• The model might reuse the special tool-call bracket notation in the final answer if it wasn’t clearly instructed not to.  \n• The conversation instructions aren’t explicit enough about the difference between “tool call” messages and “final” messages.\n\nTo minimize these issues:\n1. Be very explicit in your system instructions: “When you return the final result, it must be valid JSON with no extra text, no code fences, and no markdown.”  \n2. If you see the model returning code fences (```json ... ```), either post-process by stripping them out or instruct it to omit them.  \n3. Consider using the new OpenAI “function calling” feature if possible. It lets you define a JSON schema in the request, and you receive parsed JSON in the API response automatically.\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n5) If You’re Using OpenAI “Function Calling”\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nAn alternative (often simpler) approach is to use the new function-calling feature (in GPT-3.5 or GPT-4). In that approach, you define your function schema in your API call, and the model will either:\n• Return text if it is just answering the user.  \n• “Call” the function (which arrives as JSON data in a structured format).  \n\nThis eliminates the need for string-based bracket notation or manual parsing. You can read more in OpenAI’s documentation here:  \nhttps://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/gpt/function-calling\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nConclusion\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nBy carefully structuring your conversation and clarifying:\n• How to call the tool (MCP server).  \n• How (and when) to produce final JSON output.  \n\n…you can ensure the model “considers” the tool’s output and then returns valid JSON in your specified schema. If you still have trouble, verify that your instructions at each step are explicit about the format, and consider the built-in function calling for a more robust solution.",

I want to make sure I understand your setup correctly; please let me know if any of these points need clarifying:\n\n1. You have an MCP server that calls an external tool (or generates some output) and then you pass that output as part of your prompt when calling the OpenAI API.\n2. You’re using openai.response.parse (or a tool of similar name in your code) to help parse or enforce the output format of the final response.\n3. You observed that when you use something like text: format: '…' (i.e. when your intermediate tool output or prompt is inserted as plain text) the method works as expected, but if you try another approach (for example, directly passing structured inputs or other formats), you run into issues.\n\nA few questions and suggestions to help troubleshoot:\n\nA. Clarify the Workflow\n • What is the exact process? For instance, is it like:\n  1. Call the tool on the MCP server.\n  2. Capture its output.\n  3. Create a composite prompt that includes that output along with instructions to yield a final answer that meets a JSON schema.\n  4. Send that prompt to the OpenAI API.\n  5. Use openai.response.parse to extract or enforce the JSON format.\n\nB. Example Prompt Structure\nYou might structure your prompt like this (in pseudocode):\n\n tool_output = get_tool_output()  # your MCP server’s output\n\n prompt = (\n  \"Below is the output from an analysis tool:\\n\\n\"\n   + tool_output +\n   \"\\n\\nConsidering this output, generate a final result strictly using the following JSON schema:\\n\\n\"\n   \"{\n   \\\"key1\\\": <string>,\n   \\\"key2\\\": <number>,\n   \\\"key3\\\": <array>\n   }\"\n )\n\n Then call the API:\n response = openai.ChatCompletion.create(\n  model=\"gpt-4\",\n  messages=[\n   {\"role\": \"system\", \"content\": \"You are a helpful assistant.\"},\n   {\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": prompt}\n  ]\n )\n\n # Then parse the response\n final_output = openai.response.parse(response)\n\nC. Ensuring the AI Considers the Tool Output\nTo maximize the chance that the AI “considers” the intermediate tool output before generating the final structured JSON, it’s important that:\n • The prompt clearly delineates the tool output and instructs the model explicitly (i.e. “consider the above output”).\n • The expected JSON schema is clearly defined. You might even include an example if possible.\n • You structure the conversation with a system message that sets up the context, if necessary.\n\nD. Potential Issues with Other Formats\nYou mentioned that it works when you use text: format: '…' (i.e. a plain text insertion) but might fail when using another approach. Some things to check:\n • Make sure there is no ambiguity or unexpected characters when you inject structured data.\n • If you’re attempting to inject JSON directly (for example, using variables that are already JSON), ensure that the formatting remains valid and that the openai.response.parse utility expects the exact string format.\n • Double-check that the “final output” instructions within the prompt aren’t being overridden or omitted by inadvertent formatting issues.\n\nE. Example Code Snippet\n\nAssuming Python and a hypothetical openai.response.parse function, here’s a small snippet:\n\n------------------------------------------------\n# Pseudocode illustration\nimport openai\n\n# Step 1: Get the tool output from MCP server\ntool_output = get_tool_output()  # Your code to retrieve this output\n\n# Step 2: Build the composite prompt\njson_schema_instruction = (\n    \"Please generate a final answer in the following JSON schema:\\n\"\n    \"{\\n\"\n    '  \"username\": \"<string>\",\\n'\n    '  \"score\": \"<number>\",\\n'\n    '  \"details\": \"<array>\"\\n'\n    \"}\"\n)\nprompt = f\"Here is the output from the tool:\\n\\n{tool_output}\\n\\nBased on the above, {json_schema_instruction}\"\n\n# Step 3: Call the OpenAI API\nresponse = openai.ChatCompletion.create(\n    model=\"gpt-4\",\n    messages=[\n        {\"role\": \"system\", \"content\": \"You are a helpful assistant.\"},\n        {\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": prompt}\n    ]\n)\n\n# Step 4: Parse the response (assuming openai.response.parse works similarly)\nfinal_json = openai.response.parse(response)\n\nprint(final_json)\n------------------------------------------------\n\nF. Next Steps\n• If you encounter issues when not using text: format: '…', provide more details about the error message or describe how the output deviates from your expected JSON.\n• Confirm that your MCP server, the prompt construction, and the parsing function are all working in tandem.\n• If possible, try simplifying your prompt to isolate which part (the tool output injection or the JSON formatting directive) might be causing the trouble.\n\nI hope this breakdown helps!

To use the OpenAI Responses API in conjunction with an MCP (Multi-Channel Parsing) server, you can follow these general steps:\n\n1. **Integrate the OpenAI API**: Set up your application to use the OpenAI API. This typically involves obtaining an API key, setting up the necessary API client, and making requests to the OpenAI Responses API.\n\n2. **Process the OpenAI response**: When you receive a response from the OpenAI Responses API, you can parse the output using the `openai.response.parse` function. This will give you the structured response in a format that you can work with.\n\n3. **Send the parsed response to the MCP server**: Once you have the parsed response from the OpenAI API, you can send it to your MCP server. This may involve formatting the data in a specific JSON schema, as you mentioned.\n\n4. **Receive the MCP server's response**: The MCP server should process the input and provide a response. You can then use this response to generate the final output that you want to return.\n\nHere's a high-level example of how you might integrate these components:\n\n```python\nimport openai\n\n# Set up the OpenAI API\nopenai.api_key = \"your_openai_api_key\"\n\n# Make a request to the OpenAI Responses API\nopenai_response = openai.Completion.create(\n    engine=\"text-davinci-002\",\n    prompt=\"What is the capital of France?\",\n    max_tokens=50,\n    n=1,\n    stop=None,\n    temperature=0.5,\n)\n\n# Parse the OpenAI response\nparsed_response = openai.response.parse(openai_response)\n\n# Send the parsed response to the MCP server\nmcp_response = send_to_mcp_server(parsed_response)\n\n# Use the MCP server's response to generate the final output\nfinal_output = generate_final_output(mcp_response)\n\n# Return the final output\nreturn final_output\n```\n\nThe key points here are:\n\n1. Integrate the OpenAI API and make a request to the Responses API.\n2. Parse the OpenAI response using `openai.response.parse`.\n3. Send the parsed response to the MCP server.\n4. Use the MCP server's response to generate the final output.\n\nThe specific implementation details will depend on your MCP server setup and the JSON schema you're working with. You may need to handle error cases, format the data correctly, and integrate the MCP server's API into your application.\n\nLet me know if you have any further questions or if you need more specific guidance.",

Are you using the OpenAI chat completions API with tools/functions?  \n2. Is your workflow like this:  \n   a. AI calls a tool (function) via the API,  \n   b. Tool returns output,  \n   c. AI considers the tool output and produces a final answer in a required JSON schema?\n3. What exactly is the issue when you don’t use text: format: ...? (Is it a parsing issue, a schema issue, or something else?)\n4. Are you using the new \"function calling\" or the \"tools\" approach (these are similar but with some differences in newer OpenAI APIs)?\n\nIf you can provide more details or the rest of your message (including the code snippet or error you’re encountering), I can give much more specific help.\n\n**General guidance for your workflow:**\n\n- When you use the OpenAI tools/function-calling interface, you send a schema describing your function.\n- The AI can then “call” that function, which you implement on your server (MCP server).\n- Your server returns the function output as JSON.\n- You then pass that output back into the conversation as a tool/function response.\n- The AI can then see the tool’s output and produce a final response, which you can constrain to a JSON schema using a final function/tool call with the desired schema.\n\n**Example flow:**\n\n1. User: \"Get weather for Paris and summarize it.\"\n2. AI: (calls get_weather function with location=\"Paris\")\n3. MCP server: (returns weather data as JSON)\n4. AI: (now has weather data, produces a summary in the required JSON schema)\n5. You: (parse the final response with openai.response.parse)\n\nIf you’re having trouble getting the AI to consider previous tool outputs, make sure you’re following this flow and passing the tool output back as a tool message in the chat history before requesting the final output.\n\n**If you can share your specific code and the problem you’re running into, I can give you an exact fix!**",

The desire to chain these steps so that the “tool output” is considered by the AI before it produces its final output.  \n4. The final output should be returned in a specific JSON schema.  \n5. Everything works when the output is in “text:” format.\n\nBelow are a few considerations and suggestions you might try to ensure the JSON-based output works similarly to the text-based one:\n\n1) Nested calls and the parse logic\n   • If you’re using “openai.response.parse”, be sure that the response you’re returning from the AI is strictly JSON (if that’s your intended format). This often means you must ensure your prompt or system instructions shape the response into a valid JSON object.  \n   • As soon as the response includes any text that is outside valid JSON (for example, extra commentary, line breaks, or missing quotes), the parse function may fail.\n\n2) Structured prompting for JSON output\n   • In your system message or the user instructions, specifically instruct the AI to respond only in a valid JSON schema. You can use direct language like:  \n     - “You should structure your response as a valid JSON object with the following properties:”  \n     - Then provide a short JSON schema or example (e.g., “{ 'result': '...' }”).  \n   • Proactively include a sample response in the correct schema, so the AI follows that format.\n\n3) Confirming the intermediate “tool output”\n   • Review how you’re passing the “tool output” in the overhead pipeline. For instance, if you have a variable that holds the tool’s output and you’re injecting it into the next prompt, verify that injection is done in a way that the model sees the complete data.  \n   • Double-check that any helper functions or wrappers (like openai.response.parse) don’t inadvertently strip or modify the tool’s output before it’s appended to the final user/system prompt.\n\n4) Validate the JSON response before returning\n   • If your pipeline or parse utility enforces a JSON parse, you can add a validation step that checks for valid JSON. If it fails, either re-prompt or attempt a fix (like removing trailing commas, escaping quotes, etc.).  \n   • Some developers use a “guard” behind the scenes: they intercept the raw string from the model, parse as JSON (with a try/catch if needed in Python or similar languages), and if an error is thrown, they run a short reformat or clarification step.\n\n5) Leaves vs. Roots in the conversation\n   • If the model is given multi-step requests (where earlier steps produce data that later steps should include), confirm you pass that data as a direct portion of the user message or system message in the final step. Prompt example:  \n\n     \"\"\"\n     The tool output is as follows:\n     {{toolOutput}}\n     \n     You are to use this tool output when formulating the final JSON response. Respond with:\n     {\n       \"summary\": \"<analysis of toolOutput>\",\n       \"recommendation\": \"<any recommendation>\"\n     }\n     \"\"\"\n\n   • That explicit instruction helps the model keep the final format consistent.\n\n6) Keep everything as minimal text or JSON as possible\n   • If your pipeline relies on partial text being passed around, extraneous text (like disclaimers or conversation filler) may conflict with the JSON parse step.  \n   • Consider a strictly utilitarian style in your prompt to reduce the likelihood of the model producing additional explanations or asides outside the JSON structure.\n\nExample approach to a final step (pseudo-code):\n----------------------------------------------------------------\nsystem_prompt = \"\"\"\nYou are given the following piece of data from a tool. Incorporate it into your final JSON object.\n\nTool data:\n{{toolOutput}}\n\nYour JSON MUST follow this schema:\n\n{\n  \"fieldA\": \"string\",\n  \"fieldB\": {\n    \"key1\": \"string\",\n    \"key2\": \"string\"\n  },\n  \"summary\": \"string\"\n}\n\nConstraints:\n- Return valid JSON, with no extra keys.\n- Do not include any markdown or code fences.\n- Do not provide any additional text.\n\"\"\"\n\n# Then you call the model with system_prompt (and possibly no user message, or a short user message if your pipeline requires it).\nmodel_api_call_response = openai_chat(system=system_prompt, user=\"\")\n\n# Finally, you parse the output\nparsed_data = openai.response.parse(model_api_call_response)\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------\n\nApplying the above tips should help your JSON responses remain consistent, even if you are chaining outputs from a tool step and then passing them into the final AI call. If you still have trouble, consider logging the raw model response to confirm it remains valid JSON and that there are no hidden characters or formatting issues that break the parse.",

That parsed information is then provided as context for the final output, which should adhere to a specific JSON schema.\n\nI have a few clarifying questions:\n\n• Is the intermediate output already in a JSON format (or something close to it) or is it unstructured text?\n• When you say “text: format,” do you mean that when you provide the output as a plain text string the final JSON schema is correctly produced, but when you try another method (like passing a different format or function call), you run into problems?\n• Are you trying to “feed” the parsed results back into the model’s prompt so that it “considers” those results when generating the final response?\n\nIt could be that the tools you’re using (or the modes in which you’re calling them) affect how the AI processes the information:\n – If you supply the intermediate output as plain text, the model might be able to “read between the lines” and incorporate the important details.\n – However, if you try to pass it in a structured function call or a different format, you might need to ensure that the information is in properly formatted JSON so that openai.response.parse correctly extracts it.\n – Also, if you need the AI to use that parsed output as context for generating the final JSON, you might need to explicitly include that in your prompt. For example, you could include a snippet such as “Based on the JSON extracted earlier: …, please produce a final output that adheres to the following JSON schema: …”\n\nSome things you might try:\n 1. Double-check that the intermediate output (from your MCP server) is being returned as a valid JSON string if that’s what your parse function expects.\n 2. Make sure any additional formatting or wrapping (e.g., quotes, escaping) is consistent across your pipeline.\n 3. Ensure that your final prompt instructs the model clearly that it must incorporate the parsed output and then produce the final JSON in the specified schema.\n\nIf you could provide a small code snippet or an example of both the working “text:” case and the case where you are facing difficulties, I could give more targeted advice.\n\nLet me know if that helps or if you have more details to share!",

          "response": "Below is a general outline of how you might pass an intermediate output through to a subsequent OpenAI call, use a “parsing” step, and then finally produce your desired JSON. The specifics will vary depending on the exact libraries or frameworks you’re using (e.g., an MCP server setup, or a particular parser library). However, the basic flow remains largely the same:\n\n────────────────────────────────────────\n1. Get the “intermediate” output\n────────────────────────────────────────\n• You first prompt the model (or use a tool) to produce some intermediate result.  \n• This might be a text block, a JSON snippet that you parse, or some structured data.\n\nExample intermediate prompt (to produce raw data or an outline):\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n{\n  \"role\": \"user\",\n  \"content\": \"Generate a list of items with short descriptions.\"\n}\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe model responds with something like:\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n{\n  \"role\": \"assistant\",\n  \"content\": \"1. Item A - A brief description.\\n2. Item B - Another short description.\\n3. Item C - Yet another short description.\"\n}\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n────────────────────────────────────────\n2. Parse the intermediate response\n────────────────────────────────────────\n• Use your parser (e.g. openai.response.parse or another text-to-structured-data step) to convert the raw text from the model into a Python object (list, dictionary, etc.), or an internal representation.\n\n• If your parser library supports schema validation (for instance, if you are using something like Pydantic or JSON schema validators), you can enforce that the intermediate output matches your desired structure.\n\nPseudocode:\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nraw_text = \"<the assistant’s response from step 1>\"\nitems_list = parse(raw_text)  # parse() transforms text into a Python list\n# items_list could become something like:\n# [\"Item A - A brief description\", \"Item B - Another short description\", ...]\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n────────────────────────────────────────\n3. Use the parsed data in your next prompt\n────────────────────────────────────────\n• Now that you have structured data, you can instruct the model with a new prompt and feed it the parsed data. For example, you might say: “Given the following items, create a JSON object that fits the schema: { ‘item_name’: string, ‘description’: string }.”  \n\n• Typically, you would embed the parsed data into your new conversation messages. Or, if your library supports function calling with JSON arguments, you could follow that approach.  \n\nExample next prompt (to produce the final JSON):\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n{\n  \"role\": \"user\",\n  \"content\": \"We have these items: ['Item A - A brief description', 'Item B - Another short description', 'Item C - Yet another short description']. Convert them into JSON with the schema {item_name, description}.\"\n}\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n────────────────────────────────────────\n4. Final Parsing / JSON Schema Output\n────────────────────────────────────────\n• The model should respond with properly formatted JSON.  \n• You can again run a parsing/validation step to ensure it follows your schema.  \n\nExample final model reply:\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n{\n  \"role\": \"assistant\",\n  \"content\": \"[\n    {\n      \\\"item_name\\\": \\\"Item A\\\",\n      \\\"description\\\": \\\"A brief description\\\"\n    },\n    {\n      \\\"item_name\\\": \\\"Item B\\\",\n      \\\"description\\\": \\\"Another short description\\\"\n    },\n    {\n      \\\"item_name\\\": \\\"Item C\\\",\n      \\\"description\\\": \\\"Yet another short description\\\"\n    }\n  ]\"\n}\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThen you parse (and optionally validate) this JSON in your server to confirm it matches your schema.  \n\n────────────────────────────────────────\n5. Common Gotchas & Tips\n────────────────────────────────────────\n• Make sure each step (1) uses a system or user prompt that clearly (and repeatedly) instructs the model to keep its output in valid JSON (or whichever format you need).  \n• If you’re using OpenAI function calling (ChatCompletion with “functions” parameter), you can provide the model a JSON schema at function definition time, and the response will come structured in JSON. In this approach, the model is less likely to produce extraneous text.  \n• If you find the model sometimes wraps JSON in triple-backticks or includes extra commentary, give more specific instructions, e.g., “Return only valid JSON. Do not include any markdown formatting, quotes, or additional text.”\n\n────────────────────────────────────────\nExample Putting It All Together\n────────────────────────────────────────\nBelow is a “single-flow” pseudo-example that shows a chain of two calls (for demonstration). Adapt it to your own environment:\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n# 1. Call model to get an intermediate text output\nfirst_response = openai.ChatCompletion.create(\n    model=\"gpt-3.5-turbo\",\n    messages=[\n        {\n            \"role\": \"user\",\n            \"content\": \"Generate a short list of tasks, each with a short description.\"\n        }\n    ]\n)\n\n# 2. Parse that output\nraw_list = first_response[\"choices\"][0][\"message\"][\"content\"]\nparsed_list = parse_content_to_list(raw_list)  # your custom parse\n\n# 3. Provide the parsed list to the next prompt and request final JSON\nsecond_response = openai.ChatCompletion.create(\n    model=\"gpt-3.5-turbo\",\n    messages=[\n        {\n            \"role\": \"user\",\n            \"content\": f\"Here's the list of items I got: {parsed_list}. \"\n                       f\"Please convert them into JSON with the schema: \"\n                       f\"[{{item_name: string, description: string}}]. \"\n                       f\"Output only valid JSON.\"\n        }\n    ]\n)\n\n# 4. Retrieve and parse final JSON\nfinal_raw = second_response[\"choices\"][0][\"message\"][\"content\"]\nfinal_data = json.loads(final_raw)  # Dictionary or list per your schema\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nYou can then return final_data in your server response, or do additional checks as needed.\n\n────────────────────────────────────────\nSummary\n────────────────────────────────────────\n1. Obtain intermediate output from your first tool or prompt.  \n2. Parse the output into a usable structure (e.g., a list, dictionary).  \n3. Feed that structure into your second prompt, instructing the model to produce JSON using your schema.  \n4. Optionally parse/validate again.  \n5. Return or store the final JSON.  \n\nIf you consistently instruct the model at each step to only produce valid JSON (or your desired format), and if needed use function calls or a specialized JSON schema validation, you should see more reliable behavior.",

Generate an intermediate output (using something like a text format) with openai.response.parse.\n2. Feed that intermediate output into a final prompt that has a defined JSON schema so that the AI “considers” the earlier output before producing its final answer.\n\nBased on your description, here are some points and troubleshooting suggestions:\n\n• Intermediate Output Parsing and Chaining\n  – Verify that your initial prompt (the one that produces the intermediate output) is correctly formatted. If you’re using a parameter like text: format, make sure it is consistently applied. That’s why you noted it works when you use text: format.\n  – Confirm that openai.response.parse is extracting the expected output. You might want to log or temporarily output this intermediate result to ensure it exactly matches your expectations.\n\n• Feeding the Output into Your Finalized JSON Schema\n  – Once you have the intermediate result, you need to design your final prompt so it explicitly references that result. For instance, you could include a section like:\n   \"Based on the following analysis: [INTERMEDIATE_OUTPUT], please provide a final answer following this JSON structure: { … }.\"\n  – Make sure the JSON schema you specify is unambiguous. Clearly define expected keys and value formats so that the AI recognizes how to transform or use the intermediate data.\n\n• Consistent Formatting and API Chaining\n  – It seems that when you use text: format, your output is as expected, which might mean that formatting is crucial for recognition by openai.response.parse. Ensure that any formatting instructions (like markdown indicators, delimiters, etc.) are consistently applied both in the intermediate output and in the final prompt.\n  – Check that your MCP server’s configuration isn’t altering the text in a way that might confuse the parser. Sometimes extra whitespace or changes in delimiters can cause issues.\n\n• Potential Pitfalls and Debugging Steps\n  – If you aren’t getting the JSON you expect, double-check the final prompt’s instructions regarding the schema. It might help to test the final prompt in isolation with a known intermediate output.\n  – You might also consider adding explicit instructions to the AI on how to “consider” the intermediate output. For example, “Before producing your final output, make sure to review the analysis provided above and integrate its insights.”\n  – Ensure that any function calls to openai.response.parse flatten the output correctly. If you have nested responses or additional metadata, that might interfere.\n\nFinally, if you’re encountering errors or unexpected behavior when not using text: format, compare the working and nonworking configurations side by side. Sometimes minor differences in prompt formatting, punctuation, or schema definition can lead to divergent results.\n\nIf you have a sample of your code or error messages (with any sensitive data redacted), sharing that might help in providing more specific advice.\n\nLet me know if you need further clarification on any step or additional help!",

          "response": "This is a fascinating world-building and technical integration question! I'll break down both the technical and world-building/societal aspects based on your scenario.\n\n### 1. Technical Angle: Chaining AI Output and Consideration\n\nFrom your description, you're using an MCP server and OpenAI's API. You're parsing responses (perhaps using a tool function or function-calling capability), and you want the AI to:\n\n- Get an initial output (possibly structured via a tool call or function),\n- Then have the AI \"consider\" (or process, reflect on, or use) that output before generating a final output in a particular JSON schema.\n\nYou mention that using `text:` format makes it work, but you're likely seeking a more structured or automated method.\n\n#### Typical Approach\n\nYou can chain AI calls as follows:\n\n1. **First call:** Use the OpenAI API to generate the initial output (could be structured or free text).\n2. **Second step:** Feed the first output back into the AI, asking it to consider that output and produce the final structured response (in your desired JSON schema).\n\n#### Example (Pseudo-API Process):\n\n```python\n# Step 1: Get initial output\ninitial_response = openai.ChatCompletion.create(\n    model=\"gpt-4\",\n    messages=[{\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"Describe the suspect's behavior.\"}]\n)\n\n# Step 2: AI considers initial output and produces final JSON schema\nfinal_response = openai.ChatCompletion.create(\n    model=\"gpt-4\",\n    messages=[\n        {\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": f\"Given the following behavior: {initial_response['choices'][0]['message']['content']}, produce a summary in this JSON schema: {{'behavior': '', 'risk_level': '', 'recommendation': ''}}\"}\n    ]\n)\n```\n\n- If you use OpenAI's function calling (\"tools\") feature, you can define a schema and ask the model to fill it out, using the previous output as context.\n\n#### `openai.response.parse`\n\nIf you're using a parser (e.g., `openai.response.parse`), you can parse the initial output and then structure your prompt for the final step accordingly.\n\n- **Tip:** Always ensure the input to the AI is clear about what you want considered and the format required.\n- If you want more automation, consider wrapping this in server-side logic (on your MCP server), so the two-step process is seamless.\n\n---\n\n### 2. World-Building/Societal Handling\n\n**How would society handle this kind of AI-powered \"consideration\" and structured output?**\n\n#### Social Implications\n\n- **Transparency:** Society may demand that all AI decisions (especially in mystery/crime-solving) be transparent and auditable. The use of intermediate outputs (e.g., AI's initial impressions, then structured conclusions) could help build trust.\n- **Reliability:** Chained AI reasoning (where AI \"thinks\" in stages) might be seen as more reliable, as it mimics human deliberation.\n- **Bias and Oversight:** There would likely be protocols to review both the intermediate AI outputs and the final structured conclusions for bias or error.\n- **Legal/Ethical Use:** In a mystery universe, if this AI is used for investigations, there might be legal frameworks defining how AI output can be used in court or police work.\n- **Cultural Shifts:** People may develop new literacy around interpreting AI-generated JSON schemas and understanding the limits of AI consideration.\n\n#### Example: \"Is Common\" Output\n\nIf the output is `text: format: 'is common'`, society might see this as a baseline or statistical reasoning from the AI. The structured final output could be something like:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"behavior\": \"Loitering near the crime scene\",\n  \"risk_level\": \"Low\",\n  \"recommendation\": \"Monitor, but no immediate action\"\n}\n```\n\n- This helps authorities act in a measured way, balancing AI guidance with human judgment.\n\n---\n\n## Summary\n\n- **Technically**, chain AI calls: get an initial output, feed it back for structured consideration.\n- **Societally**, this layered approach could increase trust and accountability, but would spark debates on oversight, bias, and the role of AI in decision-making.\n\nIf you want code samples, prompt engineering tips, or deeper world-building scenarios, let me know!",

          "response": "Below are a few angles you might explore for how society in your mystery universe would respond to an advanced MCP–OpenAI integration, especially if it generates specialized outputs (such as your JSON schema) and “considers” previous outputs before finalizing new ones. These ideas can help you flesh out the cultural, technological, and ethical ramifications:\n\n1) Public Perception and Trust\n   • Transparency vs. Black Box: The general population might be split between those who appreciate the AI for its efficiency and those who fear the “black box” nature of a system that not only generates but also reprocesses its own outputs for further action.  \n   • Conspiracy Theories: The notion of an AI that “remembers” its previous outputs and refines them could fuel conspiracy fears. Rumors might circulate that the AI is being used for mind control or that it’s tampering with official records.\n\n2) Regulatory and Legal Framework\n   • Privacy and Data Ownership: Governments might enforce strict rules about how the MCP server logs all AI interactions, how those logs are stored, and who can access them. Evidence in legal or criminal cases might rely heavily on the AI’s JSON outputs, leading to new standards of digital forensics.  \n   • Liability for Errors: When the AI chain-of-thought (even indirect) leads to a wrongful accusation or misinformation, there would be debates about who holds the legal and moral responsibility—engineers, the organization running the MCP server, or the AI vendor?\n\n3) Technological and Infrastructure Impact\n   • Standardization of Output Formats: Since you’ve mentioned that it “works whenever I use text: format: ‘ is common,” society might adapt quickly to standard JSON or text-based prompts. Organizations, detective agencies, or corporations might adopt consistent schemas (like “role,” “content,” “metadata,” etc.) to orchestrate complex tasks.  \n   • Specialized Interfaces: New “interaction platforms” may arise—similar to chat platforms or VR detective boards—built around receiving the AI’s JSON-based outputs. Seeing AI suggestions in near real-time could change how investigators process evidence or how journalists fact-check.\n\n4) Cultural Shifts and Day-to-Day Use\n   • Routine Delegation to AI: If the MCP server becomes a common “middleware” connecting people’s queries to the AI’s intelligence, it might handle everything from policing narratives in public forums to triaging healthcare queries. The presence of final, JSON-structured outputs might become as everyday as a search result or a weather widget.  \n   • Rise of AI-Enhanced Professions: Investigators, archivists, or librarians might train specifically to interpret these AI outputs. Your story could highlight the tension between “traditional sleuths” who distrust or rely minimally on AI and the new wave of “AI-savvy” investigators.\n\n5) Ethical Debate and Divergent Philosophies\n   • “Human in the Loop” Doctrine: Ethics committees might demand that every AI-generated final output—especially in law enforcement or public welfare—be reviewed by a human team. Failure to do this could become taboo or illegal.  \n   • AI Reliability vs. Human Bias: Some might argue that the AI is more consistent and less biased in generating logical outputs, while critics might claim that the AI can amplify biases baked into its training data. The refactoring of its own outputs could either mitigate or worsen that bias, depending on how it’s configured.\n\n6) Narrative Hooks for a Mystery Universe\n   • AI Tampering: A central mystery might revolve around whether the AI’s JSON outputs have been manipulated or replaced by a rogue agent on the MCP server. Proving that the “chain-of-thought” was altered would be a high-stakes puzzle driving your protagonists to find hidden logs or encryption keys.  \n   • Socioeconomic Disparities: In your world, wealthier agencies or investigators might hold premium access to the AI’s more advanced functionalities, while smaller towns or marginalized communities must rely on outdated or less-capable versions. This disparity could be thematic fuel for conflict.\n\nIn short, to incorporate an MCP–OpenAI pipeline that outputs “considered” data in a strict format (like JSON), focus on illustrating:\n• How the public reacts as the AI becomes more integrated and more “aware” of its own outputs.  \n• How regulators and institutions set rules to handle evidence, bias, liability, and error.  \n• How interest groups—journalists, the public, government watchdogs—each interpret, trust, or mistrust this AI.  \n\nBy weaving in these elements, you give depth to your mystery universe and create realistic tension about how such technology would reshape society’s norms, industries, and ethical boundaries.",

          "response": "Imagine a near-future society in your mystery universe where digital processes and AI-mediated communication have become so ingrained in everyday life that even the quirks of one particular protocol can spark societal debate. Here’s one way society might handle the scenario:\n\n1. Integration as Infrastructure: In this society, an MCP server interfacing with an AI response API (using openai.response.parse) is not just a developer’s tool but a fundamental part of daily communication and data interpretation. When this system leverages a “text:” format to reliably output intermediate data before transforming it into a JSON schema, its reliability becomes a trusted mechanism. Society might build entire regulatory frameworks around such standardized formats to ensure transparent data exchange across diverse institutions.\n\n2. Legal and Ethical Oversight: Since every output undergoes a two-step process—first generating a “raw” text output and then considering it for a final JSON result—government and corporate watchdogs might scrutinize the process for hidden manipulation or bias. There could be independent audits and legal mandates ensuring that any “parsing” that occurs is fully traceable. In this universe, the careful use of standardized text formatting might lead to the formation of committees that certify algorithms, much like how today’s financial systems are regulated.\n\n3. Public Trust and Conspiracy Theories: Given the subtle complexity of these systems, a segment of the population might develop suspicions—or, in the mystery universe, even conspiracy theories—about hidden influences and “messages within messages.” People might wonder if the preliminary text output contains clandestine clues or subliminal content that the AI considers before finalizing legally binding JSON outputs. This blend of technology and enigma could spur underground movements seeking to “decode” unexpected behavior in the AI’s communication, turning routine digital exchanges into elements of clandestine intrigue.\n\n4. Cultural and Educational Shifts: With such technologies prevalent, education systems in this society likely embed programming logic and AI literacy from an early age. Citizens would learn not only how to use these tools but also how to interpret the layered outputs. The fact that using “text:” format is so common means that society would have developed a language—a sort of technical dialect—that everyone from tech specialists to casual users can understand and trust. The standardization becomes part of the cultural norm, reducing fear but also, in some circles, sparking a desire to subvert or repurpose it for secret communications in more rebellious subcultures.\n\n5. A New Digital Aesthetic: Artists, writers, and even detectives in your universe might weave these technical practices into their work. Imagine crime scenes where clues are hidden in the transition from text output to JSON—a nod to how the information was processed and refined by a highly algorithmic society. The interplay between raw and formatted data might become a metaphor for hidden truths and official narratives, making the mundane act of “parsing” an act of both creativity and subtle resistance.\n\nIn summary, society in your mystery universe would treat this technology as both a necessary utility and a potential source of hidden drama. Its reliability in using common text formatting would be celebrated for its clarity and efficiency, yet its layered processing might also become a focal point for oversight, skepticism, and a rich tapestry of cultural expression—where every bit of data could harbor unexpected secrets.",

          "response": "It seems your prompt is slightly ambiguous; let's clarify the context first. You're mentioning an MCP server and an OpenAI API call (`openai.response.parse`) within the context of a mystery universe you are building. You also mention a JSON schema and indicate that your current workflow works fine when using the `text: format: ‘` convention.\n\nBased on your description, I assume you have an MCP (perhaps \"Master Control Program\" or a similar middleware/processing server) set up to handle requests, call OpenAI's API, parse the responses, and then produce a final structured JSON output. You seem to have a working scenario when your prompt formatting uses the style `text: format: ‘`, but perhaps you want to improve or clarify how your system could handle more complex interactions or scenarios within your mystery universe.\n\nHere’s how you might approach organizing and structuring your setup clearly:\n\n## Recommended Workflow for Your Scenario:\n\n### Step 1: Clarify Your Workflow Components\nClearly separate your server's logic into distinct stages:\n\n- **Prompt Construction:**  \n  Provide clear, structured prompts to the OpenAI API, possibly including contextual clues or previous MCP-generated outputs.\n  \n- **Initial AI Response (Raw Output):**  \n  Get an initial output from OpenAI's API in plain text or a structured intermediate format.\n\n- **Intermediate Parsing (`openai.response.parse`):**  \n  Pass the AI's raw response into your MCP server or parsing middleware to extract structured data.\n\n- **Final AI Consideration:**  \n  Send parsed data back into the AI context, allowing the AI to reconsider or reinterpret the parsed information before generating a final structured JSON response.\n\n### Step 2: Structured Prompting Approach\nA structured prompt template can help your AI interpret instructions clearly. For example:\n\n```\n{\n  \"context\": \"In this mystery universe, <brief context description>\",\n  \"initial_request\": \"<your original prompt or scenario>\",\n  \"previous_output\": \"<MCP server parsed output from previous step, if any>\",\n  \"instruction\": \"Consider the previous_output carefully. Given the provided context, generate the final output according to the following JSON schema:\",\n  \"output_schema\": {\n     \"entity\": \"<person, location, item, etc.>\",\n     \"condition\": \"<e.g., missing, stolen, evidence found>\",\n     \"details\": \"<additional relevant details>\",\n     \"impact\": \"<how this affects the mystery narrative or society>\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### Step 3: JSON Schema Enforcement and AI Prompting\nWhen you ask the AI to generate JSON-formatted output, explicitly instruct it to produce JSON-compliant responses. For example:\n\n```\nGiven the above information, please generate the final structured JSON response, strictly adhering to the provided schema:\n{\n  \"entity\": \"\",\n  \"condition\": \"\",\n  \"details\": \"\",\n  \"impact\": \"\"\n}\n```\n\n### Step 4: Handling the `text: format: ‘` Issue\nYou mentioned the prompt works fine with a `text: format: ‘` style. This might indicate that your MCP server or parser is expecting certain delimiters or formatting. If your system relies on special delimiters (like `'` or `‘`), a recommended approach is:\n\n- Always ensure your prompt and response templates consistently use the delimiter your parser expects.\n- Clearly document and standardize these delimiters in your middleware logic.\n- If you want more flexibility, consider updating your parsing logic (in your MCP server) to recognize JSON directly, rather than relying on special delimiters. JSON parsing (e.g., `JSON.parse`) is typically more robust and easier to manage than custom delimiters.\n\n### Step 5: How Your Fictional Society Might Handle the Technical Integration\nIf your question \"How would society handle this?\" refers to your in-universe mystery context, consider world-building implications as follows:\n\n- **In-universe AI Infrastructure:** Perhaps your fictional society treats MCP as a highly trusted oracle or mediator, with strict rules on input/output schemas to ensure transparency or prevent misinformation.\n- **Ethical Implications:** Your mystery society might grapple with ethical or legal concerns, e.g., who controls the MCP server, who monitors AI-generated content, and what happens when the AI response diverges from expected schemas.\n- **Narrative Integration:** Such structured AI interactions could become clues or red herrings in your mystery narrative, allowing your characters to investigate data discrepancies or unauthorized schema modifications.\n\n---\n\n## Summary Recommendations:\n- Clarify and document your MCP server workflow clearly (prompt → initial AI response → parsing → final reconsideration → structured JSON).\n- Use standardized JSON schemas rather than custom delimiters if possible.\n- Explicitly instruct the AI to adhere strictly to your JSON schema.\n- Leverage these structured interactions to enrich your mystery narrative, considering societal implications and ethical dimensions.\n\nIf you’d like more specific technical advice or narrative world-building guidance, please clarify further details about your MCP server setup, your mystery universe scenario, or your exact technical implementation.",

Make an initial API call to OpenAI\n2. Process that output through your MCP server\n3. Send the processed data back to OpenAI for final formatting in your desired JSON schema\n\n## Implementation Approach\n\n```python\nimport openai\nimport json\nfrom mcp_server import process_data  # Your MCP server interface\n\n# Initial query to OpenAI\ninitial_response = openai.ChatCompletion.create(\n    model=\"gpt-4\",\n    messages=[{\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"What should students know about API integration?\"}],\n    temperature=0.7\n)\n\n# Extract the text content\ninitial_content = initial_response.choices[0].message.content\n\n# Process through MCP server\nmcp_processed_data = process_data(initial_content)\n\n# Final formatting with OpenAI\nfinal_response = openai.ChatCompletion.create(\n    model=\"gpt-4\",\n    messages=[\n        {\"role\": \"system\", \"content\": \"Format the following information into the required JSON schema\"},\n        {\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": f\"MCP processed data: {mcp_processed_data}\"}\n    ],\n    response_format={\"type\": \"json_object\"},\n    temperature=0.5\n)\n```\n\n## What Students Should Know\n\nFor your curriculum, students should understand:\n\n1. API authentication and key management\n2. How to make sequential API calls\n3. Data parsing and transformation between systems\n4. JSON schema design and validation\n5. Error handling for API responses\n6. Rate limiting considerations\n7. Asynchronous processing for better performance\n8. Testing strategies for API integrations\n\n## Common Issues and Solutions\n\nIf you're experiencing issues with the text format working but other formats failing, check:\n\n1. The response format specification in your API call\n2. JSON schema validation in your processing pipeline\n3. Whether your MCP server is properly handling different content types\n4.

Chaining Tool Outputs with OpenAI API\n\n**Typical Multi-Step Reasoning Pattern:**\n\n- **Step 1:** Use a tool (via OpenAI function calling or tool use) to get some data or perform an operation.\n- **Step 2:** Pass the tool’s output back into the conversation as context, so the AI can consider it for the next step.\n- **Step 3:** Ask the AI to produce a final output, conforming to a specified JSON schema.\n\n**Example (Pseudocode):**\n\n```python\n# Step 1: Tool use (e.g., get social media timeline)\ntool_output = tool_call(\"get_social_media_history\", {\"topic\": \"social media\"})\n\n# Step 2: OpenAI API call, considering tool output\nsystem_prompt = \"You are an expert analyst.\"\nuser_prompt = f\"Given the following tool output:\\n{tool_output}\\n\\nSummarize the key changes in social media since its emergence in JSON format: {{'era': str, 'main_changes': list}}\"\n\nresponse = openai.chat.completions.create(\n    model=\"gpt-4\",\n    messages=[\n        {\"role\": \"system\", \"content\": system_prompt},\n        {\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": user_prompt}\n    ],\n    temperature=0.7\n)\nprint(response.choices[0].message.content)\n```\n\n**Tips:**\n- **Always include the tool output in the prompt** if you want the AI to consider it.\n- **Explicitly specify the required JSON schema** in your instructions.\n- **If using function calling (OpenAI v1 API), you can define your schema as a function signature.**\n\n---\n\n## 2. Social Media Evolution Since Its Emergence (Sample Content)\n\nHere’s a concise summary in JSON format, as you might expect from such a workflow:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"eras\": [\n    {\n      \"era\": \"Early 2000s\",\n      \"main_changes\": [\n        \"Emergence of platforms like Friendster, MySpace, and early Facebook\",\n        \"Focus on personal profiles and connecting with friends\"\n      ]\n    },\n    {\n      \"era\": \"Late 2000s-2010s\",\n      \"main_changes\": [\n        \"Rise of Twitter, Instagram, and mainstream Facebook\",\n        \"Mobile usage increases, introduction of news feeds and real-time updates\",\n        \"Social media becomes a tool for activism and information sharing\"\n      ]\n    },\n    {\n      \"era\": \"2010s-2020s\",\n      \"main_changes\": [\n        \"Emergence of Snapchat, TikTok, short-form and video-first content\",\n        \"Algorithmic feeds and personalized content curation\",\n        \"Concerns about privacy, misinformation, and mental health\",\n        \"Integration with e-commerce and advertising\"\n      ]\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n## If You’re Having Issues With Output Formatting:\n\n- **Check your prompt:** Make sure you are asking for output in the correct format and that the AI is seeing all necessary context.\n- **Use function calling:** With OpenAI GPT-4 and later, you can define a strict schema in the function signature for guaranteed output structure.\n- **Debug by logging intermediate steps:** Ensure your tool output is properly passed to the AI.\n\n---\n\n**If you clarify your question or provide the missing part, I can give more precise technical help!**",

          "response": "Social media has evolved significantly since its mainstream emergence in the early 2000s. Below are some key ways it has changed over time:\n\n1) Platform Diversity and Features\n   • Early social networks (e.g., MySpace, Friendster) focused on basic profile pages and friend lists.  \n   • Modern platforms (e.g., TikTok, Instagram, Snapchat) emphasize multimedia and short-form content like stories, reels, and live streaming.  \n   • Many platforms now integrate e-commerce features (e.g., Instagram Shopping, TikTok Shop) and subscription features (e.g., Twitter Blue).  \n\n2) Growth of Influencer Culture\n   • “Influencers” have become a significant factor in marketing; brands partner with individuals who have large followings to promote products.  \n   • Micro-influencers with smaller but highly engaged communities have also gained traction.\n\n3) Algorithmic Curation and Personalization\n   • Content is increasingly filtered by AI-driven algorithms, prioritizing posts most likely to keep users engaged.  \n   • Feeds tailor content to individual interests, moving away from chronological timelines.\n\n4) Shifts in User Engagement\n   • Interactions have moved from text-based status updates to photos, videos, ephemeral stories, and live streams.  \n   • Comment sections, direct messaging, and group chats drive more personalized or private communication.\n\n5) Monetization and Data Usage\n   • Advertising models became more sophisticated with highly targeted ads using personal data.  \n   • Concerns about user privacy, data ethics, and platform accountability have become major societal issues.\n\n6) Community Building and Niche Platforms\n   • As mainstream platforms grew, users also gravitated toward niche communities (e.g., Discord servers, subreddit communities) for more focused interactions.  \n   • These spaces often prioritize shared interests over broad, public conversations.\n\n7) Global and Cultural Impact\n   • Social media has played a central role in political discourse, influencer trends, social movements, and global activism.  \n   • Rapid dissemination of information can raise awareness of causes but also facilitates the spread of misinformation.\n\n8) Regulatory and Ethical Considerations\n   • Governments and regulatory bodies worldwide are exploring or enacting laws to manage data privacy, misinformation, and content moderation.  \n   • Platforms respond by adjusting policies, adding fact-checking features, and experimenting with content labeling.\n\nOverall, social media has moved from simple digital networking to complex ecosystems where people communicate, shop, learn, and organize in real time. This shift has brought new opportunities for creators, brands, and communities—alongside significant challenges related to privacy, mental health, misinformation, and balanced content moderation.",

          "response": "There are a few interrelated shifts in how the API (and often the tooling around it) processes instructions that might be affecting your setup. In earlier versions or configurations, you could “guide” the assistant by letting it produce an intermediate text output (for example, by using a text: format directive) and then have a follow‐up stage where that intermediate output would be taken into account before the final JSON was produced. However, a number of things have evolved recently—both in terms of model behavior and in the way the API is intended to be used. Here are some of the key factors:\n\n1. Two‐phase processing and chain‑of‑thought separation:  \n • Earlier workflows sometimes mixed the “thinking” phase (internal reasoning) with the output phase. This could be done by including text (e.g., “text:” formatting) that the tool would then parse.  \n • More recent improvements (and our emphasis on chain‑of‑thought handling) mean that the model now more often separates internal reasoning from its “final” answer. Essentially, the internal work is meant to be hidden, and only the final answer should be exposed. This “policing” of chain‑of‑thought can break workflows that expect the intermediate text to be available for parsing.\n\n2. Function calling and strict JSON output expectations:  \n • The OpenAI API—especially in the newer “function calling” paradigm—expects you to declare an explicit JSON schema for the final output.  \n • When you rely on text: formatting to produce intermediate results that are then fed back into the model (or a parsing tool), you might find that the API/model is less willing to “leak” its internal work if you haven’t explicitly defined the message as a function call.  \n • This has the effect that workflows which used to rely on a text: directive now may get “cleaned up” or adjusted internally, so that only the final JSON (and not the intermediate text) is exposed.\n\n3. Evolving best practices and security expectations (sometimes influenced by external trends like social media):  \n • There has been a broader push over time to limit how internal reasoning or meta commentary is surfaced in outputs.  \n • This shift is partly driven by concerns about prompt injection and similar issues that have become more prominent with the rise of social media and other publicly visible integrations.  \n • As a consequence, if your tooling relied on a sort of “leakage” of intermediate output (for example, to refine the final JSON) this behavior might now be suppressed or re-routed in the pipeline.\n\n4. Integration with legacy servers (like your MCP server):  \n • When integrating with legacy or custom server solutions, subtle changes in how the API expects instructions can lead to discrepancies.  \n • For instance, if your MCP server was set up using an older callback or chaining mechanism (perhaps using a custom “text:” flag), that setup might not map directly to the newer function-call expectations or the new “hidden chain-of-thought” behavior.\n\nTo summarize, what has changed is essentially that the handling of intermediate or “text:” formatted outputs versus final structured outputs (JSON) has grown more strict. OpenAI’s API and associated parsing libraries now enforce a clearer boundary between internal reasoning and externally visible results. This manifests as:  \n\n – A stronger separation between the chain-of-thought process and the final answer,  \n – An expectation that the final output follow a strict JSON schema (often provided via function call parameters), and  \n – Reduced “leakage” of any intermediate text that might have previously been used to inform the final answer.\n\nIf your goal is to incorporate intermediary processing and then have that output serve as an input to generating a final JSON output, you’ll need to adjust your workflow. Consider one of these approaches:  \n\n • Use explicit function calling where you define your JSON schema upfront and then structure your messages so that any intermediate reasoning is kept internal,  \n • If you really need to expose intermediate results, design your prompt so that the assistant clearly differentiates between internal notes (which should be hidden) and the final output (which follows the JSON schema), or  \n • Implement an external chaining mechanism (outside of the API’s single call/response) where you first request an intermediate result and then feed that into a subsequent call that enforces the JSON schema.\n\nIn essence, the evolution reflects a move toward more secure and predictable behavior that avoids unintended exposure of internal reasoning, especially in contexts that might be publicly visible or subject to prompt injection risks. This is why your previous approach using text: formatting works “since the social media emergence” – now things are set up so that those intermediate stages aren’t leaked, and you have to adjust your instructions accordingly.",

Here are a few thoughts on your approach:\n\n1. **MCP Server Integration**: Integrating an MCP server with the OpenAI API can be a complex task, as you'll need to handle the communication between the two systems, parse the input from the MCP server, and then send it to the OpenAI API for processing.\n\n2. **OpenAI API Usage**: When using the OpenAI API, you'll need to ensure that you're formatting your requests correctly and handling the responses appropriately. The `openai.response.parse` function you mentioned doesn't seem to be a part of the official OpenAI Python library, so you'll need to ensure that you're using the correct methods and functions to interact with the API.\n\n3. **JSON Schema**: To generate responses in a specific JSON schema, you'll need to parse the output from the OpenAI API and then transform it into the desired format. This may require some additional processing and logic to ensure that the final output matches your requirements.\n\n4. **Iterative Approach**: It's often helpful to take an iterative approach when working on a complex integration like this. Start by getting the basic communication between the MCP server and the OpenAI API working, and then gradually build up the functionality to handle the specific input and output requirements.\n\nAs for what has changed with the evolution of social media, there have been a number of significant developments over the years:\n\n- Increased user adoption and engagement: Social media platforms have seen exponential growth in the number of users and the amount of time spent on these platforms.\n- Shift towards mobile-first experiences: With the rise of smartphones, social media has become primarily a mobile-based experience.\n- Diversification of platforms and content types: Beyond the traditional text-based posts, social media now encompasses a wide range of content types, including images, videos, live streams, and more.\n- Algorithmic curation of content: Social media platforms have implemented complex algorithms to determine what content is shown to users, based on factors like engagement, interests, and social connections.\n- Monetization and advertising: Social media platforms have become important channels for businesses and advertisers to reach and engage with their target audiences.\n- Privacy and data concerns: There has been increased scrutiny and debate around the privacy implications of social media and the way user data is collected and used.\n\nThese are just a few of the key changes that have occurred in the social media landscape over the years.

You would want to ensure:\n\n- Your MCP server and the OpenAI API endpoint both support PQC-secure TLS or similar protocols.\n- Any intermediate data, especially structured outputs, are signed and verifiable to prevent tampering—potentially using PQC digital signatures.\n\n### 2. **AI Reasoning and Tool Use in Multi-Stage Workflows**\nOpenAI models are increasingly able to reason over intermediate outputs, especially if you format them clearly. Your workflow (getting intermediate output, then having the AI consider it before producing a final JSON result) is a strong pattern for complex reasoning.\n\n- **Prompt Engineering**: When you find that using text: format: 'X' works, you’re leveraging the model’s ability to follow explicit instructions about output formatting.\n- **JSON Schema Enforcement**: OpenAI’s newer models (especially with function calling and tool use) are better at adhering to specified JSON schemas when you provide clear schema examples and instructions.\n\n### 3. **Speculative Future: AI-Aided Post-Quantum Cryptography**\n- You could use the AI’s intermediate reasoning steps to automatically analyze or verify whether proposed data structures or cryptographic operations in your MCP server are quantum-secure.\n- The AI might also be capable of suggesting PQC algorithms or flagging potential vulnerabilities in intermediate outputs before the final output is generated.\n\n---\n\n## Practical Example (Pseudocode)\n\nHere’s how your workflow might look, abstracted:\n\n```python\n# Step 1: Send initial prompt\nprompt1 = \"Analyze the following data and suggest a format for secure post-quantum storage. Return ONLY the formatted text.\"\nresponse1 = openai.Completion.create(prompt=prompt1)\nformatted_output = openai.response.parse(response1)\n\n# Step 2: Use output as context for final structured output\nprompt2 = f\"Given this formatted data: {formatted_output}, generate a JSON object matching this schema: {{...}}\"\nfinal_response = openai.Completion.create(prompt=prompt2)\nfinal_json = openai.response.parse(final_response)\n```\n\nBy explicitly specifying text: format: 'X', you’re guiding the AI to return output in a way that your MCP server can reliably parse and process for the next step.\n\n---\n\n## Recommendations\n\n- **Prompt Clarity**: Always specify the expected output structure. If ‘text: format:’ works, use it consistently.\n- **Schema Examples**: Provide schema examples in your prompts for best results.\n- **Security**: In a post-quantum era, ensure your server-client communication and data storage use PQC algorithms.\n- **AI Tool Use**: Expect future AI models to natively support multi-stage reasoning and output validation, especially for complex workflows like yours.\n\n---\n\nIf you’d like a sample prompt or more technical speculation, let me know!",

          "response": "Below is a conceptual walkthrough of how you might configure a two-step process—first to generate intermediate text from OpenAI, and then to re-parse or re-use that intermediate text to produce a final JSON structure. The example is general enough that you can adapt it for an “MCP” server or any other integration scenario where you need to feed an AI’s output back into itself or another service.\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n1. Set up your prompt and desired output format\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n\n• Decide on the final JSON schema you want. For instance, suppose you need something like:\n\n{\n  \"topic\": \"Post-Quantum Computing\",\n  \"predictions\": [\n    {\n      \"year\": 2030,\n      \"description\": \"...\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n\n• Let the AI know you expect properly formatted JSON (or some other structure) at the end. You can embed instructions in your prompt to ensure compliance. For example:\n\n  System message or instructions to the model:\n  “You are an assistant that outputs JSON in the following exact format:\n   {\n     \"topic\": \"<string>\",\n     \"predictions\": [\n       {\n         \"year\": <integer>,\n         \"description\": \"<string>\"\n       },\n       ...\n     ]\n   }\n   Do not include any additional keys.”\n\n• Sometimes you may need an intermediate output from the AI that contains some text or data you want to parse with openai.response.parse. In that case, be explicit in your instructions that you need a two-stage process:\n  1) Return raw text or structured text (like a minimal JSON) that can be parsed.  \n  2) Use that parsed text in the second step to produce the final JSON.\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n2. First call: Generate an intermediate textual output\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n\nIn a two-step approach, you might do something like:\n\n• Prompt #1 (to get intermediate data):\n  “Please list three major predictions about the post-quantum computing era, with short bullet points for each. \n   Make no references to final JSON or any code. Just provide them in plain bullet points.”\n\n• Expected AI output (example):\n  • Quantum-resistant algorithms become standard.\n  • Cloud providers begin offering quantum services.\n  • Hybrid quantum/classical systems are common in HPC.\n\nThis textual output can then be parsed within your own code (e.g., with openai.response.parse or any custom parser) or stored in the MCP server, depending on your architecture.\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n3. Use the intermediate output as input for the final JSON creation\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n\n• Prompt #2 (to produce final JSON):\n  “Based on the following three bullet points:\n    1) Quantum-resistant algorithms become standard.\n    2) Cloud providers begin offering quantum services.\n    3) Hybrid quantum/classical systems are common in HPC.\n\n   Transform them into a JSON object following exactly this schema:\n\n   {\n     \"topic\": \"Post-Quantum Computing\",\n     \"predictions\": [\n       {\n         \"year\": <some integer>,\n         \"description\": \"<string>\"\n       },\n       ...\n     ]\n   }\n\n   Please do not include any additional keys, text, or formatting outside of the JSON.”\n\n• The key here is to ensure your second prompt is explicit about what you expect. The AI will read the bullet points (which you have from the first output), and then produce the final structured JSON that matches your schema.\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n4. Handling the “format: text” vs. “format: JSON” question\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n\n• If you are using function calling or a specialized endpoint (e.g., ChatGPT’s function-calling), you can tell the model exactly how you want the result returned. However, if you are using a generic completion or chat completion endpoint, you might rely on natural language instructions to request valid JSON.\n\n• One common pitfall is that the model might generate additional text or commentary. Mitigate this by carefully instructing the model to return JSON only. You can also handle any extraneous text by programmatically extracting the JSON substring in your own code.\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n5. Integrating with an MCP server or other backends\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n\n• Once you have an intermediate output from OpenAI, you can store it or parse it on your MCP server before the final output.  \n• If your workflow is something like:  \n  1) Query → 2) parse → 3) feed into the second query → 4) produce structured JSON,  \n  you should ensure that each step is invoked with the correct data. If your openai.response.parse (or a similar function) is working only when the response is text-based, keep it that way for the intermediate step.\n\n• If your server expects JSON in a particular schema, verify that the final output is well-formed by validating it against your schema or at least checking for syntax errors with something like a JSON parser.\n\n──────────────────────────────────────────────────\n6. Example pseudo-code snippet (Python-like)\n──────────────────────────────────────────────────\n\n# Step 1: Get intermediate predictions\nprompt1 = \"\"\"\nPlease list three major predictions about the post-quantum computing era, in brief bullet points.\n\"\"\"\nresponse1 = openai.ChatCompletion.create(\n    model=\"gpt-3.5-turbo\",\n    messages=[{\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": prompt1}]\n)\n\nintermediate_text = response1.choices[0].message[\"content\"]\n# 'intermediate_text' might be a string with bullet points.\n\n# Optional: parse or process the text here (if needed)\nparsed_points = openai.response.parse(intermediate_text)  \n# Or handle manually with Python string methods or a bullet-point parser.\n\n# Step 2: Generate final JSON\nprompt2 = f\"\"\"\nBased on the following points:\n{intermediate_text}\n\nTransform them into a valid JSON object following this schema:\n{{\n  \"topic\": \"Post-Quantum Computing\",\n  \"predictions\": [\n    {{\n      \"year\": <integer>,\n      \"description\": \"<string>\"\n    }},\n    ...\n  ]\n}}\nOnly output valid JSON, nothing else.\n\"\"\"\n\nresponse2 = openai.ChatCompletion.create(\n    model=\"gpt-3.5-turbo\",\n    messages=[{\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": prompt2}]\n)\n\nfinal_json_str = response2.choices[0].message[\"content\"]\n# Validate or directly parse the JSON\nimport json\nfinal_data = json.loads(final_json_str)\n\n# 'final_data' now contains your structured predictions.\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nIn summary\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n\n1. Separate your generation process into two steps:  \n   (a) Get the raw or lightly structured text you need.  \n   (b) Prompt the model again, re-using the text from step (a), and demand a final JSON schema.\n\n2. Clearly instruct the model in your second prompt to ONLY produce JSON in the exact schema you specify.  \n\n3. If your “format: text” approach works best for the intermediate phase, keep it that way. Then re-parse or feed that answer into the next step.\n\n4. Finally, validate the JSON output in your own code (or on the MCP server) to confirm it matches the expected structure before using it elsewhere.\n\nThis pattern should let you orchestrate a multi-step reasoning workflow that starts with free-form AI-generated text and ends with a structured, schema-compliant JSON object suitable for your post-quantum computing documentation (or any other end use).",

          "response": "Below is one way to think about the overall flow—and some ideas to implement it—that might help you structure your thoughts as you write about your system. (Note that since your setup is speculative and cutting‐edge, the exact details might need further refinement in your narrative.)\n\n1. Process flow overview:\n a. Your MCP server sends an initial request to the OpenAI API for a “preliminary” output. This output isn’t yet in the final JSON schema you need but contains key data points (or “notes”) that the AI should consider.\n b. You then pass that output to your tool—via something like openai.response.parse—to “re-read” the earlier output and include it in a final prompt.\n c. This final prompt instructs the AI, “Based on the preliminary data I got earlier, please produce an output that conforms exactly to the following JSON schema…” By designing the instructions carefully, you enable the model to consider its earlier computed output when generating final results.\n\n2. Using text: format as a fallback:\n Sometimes issues arise when the API struggles to both generate creative responses and adhere to a strict output structure. It sounds like using a text: format (enclosing the intermediate output as pure text) serves as a relatively error-free “container” you can parse more reliably. In other words, when you say:\n  { \"text\": \"your preliminary output\" }\n as an intermediate step, your system is better able to reliably pass that string (without extra formatting artifacts) to the next stage of processing.\n\n3. Implementing openai.response.parse:\n a. In your speculative design, openai.response.parse is used to extract or verify that the final AI output adheres to your JSON schema.\n b. You might design your parsing function to first run checks on the text output (for instance, using a JSON schema validator) and then either return the parsed JSON if it’s correct or flag errors that require a re-run or additional instructions.\n\n4. Chain-of-thought with final JSON output:\n a. The key to success here is to “prime” the AI: include the preliminary output (as an example, or as raw input data) in the final prompt.\n b. In the final prompt, be explicit with instructions: “Take into account the following preliminary data: [data from MCP], then produce a final answer that follows this JSON schema exactly.”\n c. Emphasize that no extraneous text should be included. This helps the model “lock in” on the required format and avoid issues that can arise when mixing free text with data structures.\n\n5. A Sample Pseudocode Outline:\n\n // Step 1: Get preliminary output from MCP via OpenAI API.\n preliminary_output = call_openai_api(prompt=\"Generate initial data about post-quantum impact on cryptography\", format='text')\n\n // Step 2: Pass the preliminary output to your parsing tool function.\n // Here, the tool (openai.response.parse) acts as both a validator and a “data siphon.”\n intermediate_json = openai.response.parse(preliminary_output)  // This may simply wrap the text in a container.\n\n // Step 3: Formulate the final prompt including the preliminary output.\n final_prompt = \"\"\"\n Please consider the following data:\n {0}\n Now, based on this, generate a final output strictly following this JSON schema:\n {\n  \"status\": \"string\",\n  \"details\": { \"description\": \"string\", \"parameters\": [\"string\"] }\n }\n Ensure that the final result contains only the JSON structure (no extra text).\n \"\"\".format(intermediate_json['text'])\n\n // Step 4: Request the final output.\n final_output = call_openai_api(prompt=final_prompt, format='json')\n\n6. Key Speculation Points in a Post-Quantum Context:\n Since you’re writing about a post-quantum computing era, you might speculate that traditional cryptographic handshakes or outputs from your MCP server might need to be “authenticated” or validated by quantum-resistant techniques. Perhaps your parsing function is designed to also validate cryptographic proofs (or signatures) embedded in the initial output. This additional layer could account for an era where even verifying data integrity demands new methods.\n\n7. Troubleshooting and Considerations:\n a. Intermittent successes when using the text: format indicate that preserving raw string fidelity is important. This might be due to how the model handles embedded formatting when trying to output JSON directly.\n b. You could experiment with “meta” prompts that include examples. For example, “Here is an example of the correct JSON response format: …” This shows the model a concrete example of what it should produce.\n c. It might be useful to include fallback instructions for when the AI’s output deviates from the schema (for example, a correction loop that re-parses and re-prompts).\n\nBy carefully designing the chain—from the MCP server’s initial output to the final validated JSON output—you create a two-stage process that leverages OpenAI’s API capabilities while ensuring that each step adheres to strict formatting rules. This layered approach mirrors the kind of careful, robust processing logic you’d need in a post-quantum computing era, where data integrity and strict protocols are paramount.\n\nI hope this helps clarify your ideas and provides a solid framework to write about your innovative design!",

It sounds like you're experiencing issues with structured output when using `openai.response.parse` with a specific JSON schema.\n\nHere are some potential solutions and considerations for your scenario:\n\n## 1. **Tool Output Pre-Processing**\n\nIn a post-quantum context, ensure your MCP server output is properly formatted before passing it to the AI:\n\n```python\n# Example approach\ntool_output = mcp_server.execute_tool(tool_name, params)\nprocessed_output = {\n    \"tool_response\": str(tool_output),\n    \"metadata\": {\n        \"quantum_signature\": tool_output.get(\"q_sig\"),\n        \"coherence_state\": tool_output.get(\"coherence\")\n    }\n}\n\n# Convert to text format first\ntext_representation = f\"Tool Output: {json.dumps(processed_output, indent=2)}\"\n```\n\n## 2. **Two-Stage Response Pattern**\n\nSince text format works, consider a two-stage approach:\n\n```python\n# Stage 1: Get AI consideration in text format\ninitial_response = openai.chat.completions.create(\n    model=\"gpt-4\",\n    messages=[\n        {\"role\": \"system\", \"content\": \"Analyze the following tool output...\"},\n        {\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": text_representation}\n    ],\n    response_format={\"type\": \"text\"}\n)\n\n# Stage 2: Structure the final output\nfinal_response = openai.beta.chat.completions.parse(\n    model=\"gpt-4\",\n    messages=[\n        {\"role\": \"system\", \"content\": \"Based on your analysis, provide structured output...\"},\n        {\"role\": \"assistant\", \"content\": initial_response.choices[0].message.content},\n        {\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"Now format this according to the schema...\"}\n    ],\n    response_format=YourJsonSchema\n)\n```\n\n## 3. **Quantum-Era Considerations**\n\nFor post-quantum computing scenarios, you might want to consider:\n\n- **Quantum-resistant serialization**: Traditional JSON might need enhancement for quantum data types\n- **Coherence preservation**: Ensure your tool outputs maintain quantum state information\n- **Error correction**: Post-quantum systems might need additional error handling\n\n## 4. **Schema Adaptation**\n\nYour JSON schema might need to be more flexible:\n\n```python\nfrom pydantic import BaseModel, Field\nfrom typing import Optional, Any\n\nclass QuantumAwareSchema(BaseModel):\n    classical_output: str\n    quantum_metrics: Optional[dict[str, Any]] = Field(default_factory=dict)\n    tool_considerations: str\n    confidence_matrix: Optional[list[float]] = None\n```\n\n## 5. **Hybrid Approach**\n\nSince text format works reliably, you could use a hybrid approach:\n\n```python\n# Get text analysis first\ntext_analysis = get_text_analysis(tool_output)\n\n# Then parse into structured format\nstructured_output = {\n    \"analysis\": text_analysis,\n    \"structured_data\": parse_to_schema(text_analysis),\n    \"quantum_annotations\": extract_quantum_markers(tool_output)\n}\n```\n\nWould you like me to elaborate on any of these approaches or help you debug a specific aspect of your MCP server integration?",

What happens if the data is not in the expected format?\n   - Are you passing the intermediate output (from the tool) to the AI as plain text, or are you using a structured format (like JSON)?\n\n3. **About JSON Schema**\n   - What is the final JSON schema you want the AI to output? Is it possible for you to share an example of your desired output?\n\n4. **Intermediary Output Handling**\n   - How are you feeding the output of the tool back into the AI? Are you using a system message, user message, or function/tool call?\n   - Do you explicitly specify in your prompt or API call that the AI should consider this intermediary output before producing the final JSON?\n\n5. **Format Compatibility**\n   - Why do you think the text: format works, whereas other formats do not?\n   - Could there be an issue with how non-text formats are parsed or passed between the MCP server, your tool, and OpenAI's API?\n\n6. **Error Handling and Debugging**\n   - Do you see any errors or unexpected behaviors when not using the text: format? If so, what are they?\n   - Have you tried logging or inspecting the raw data that gets sent to and received from each component in your pipeline?\n\n7. **Tool and API Limitations**\n   - Are there limitations in openai.response.parse regarding what formats it can handle?\n   - Does the MCP server modify or expect data in a certain way that could affect compatibility with OpenAI's API?\n\n8. **Final Output Considerations**\n   - Is your final output schema always consistent, or does it vary depending on the intermediary output?\n   - How do you validate that the AI's final output conforms to your JSON schema? Do you use schema validation tools?\n\n**Summary of Important Considerations:**\n\n- The format of the data passed between components (text vs. structured formats).\n- How intermediate outputs are integrated into the prompt/context for the AI.\n- Whether openai.response.parse expects a specific input structure.\n- The compatibility of your MCP server and tool outputs with OpenAI’s input requirements.\n- Error handling and logging at each step.\n- Ensuring that the AI's output adheres to the required JSON schema.\n\nWould you like to discuss any of these points in more detail?

          "response": "Here are some key considerations when using an MCP server in conjunction with the OpenAI responses API (via something like openai.response.parse) for multi-step workflows and final JSON output:\n\n1. Prompt Design and Parsing Strategy  \n   • Provide Clear Instruction in the Prompt: When you want the model’s response in JSON or a specific schema, explicitly state this requirement in your system or user prompt (e.g., “Return a JSON object in the following format…”) to reduce the likelihood of invalid or unparseable output.  \n   • Use Step-by-Step or Chain-of-Thought Reasoning Carefully: If you intend to have the AI “think” about the output from a previous step, you can provide that intermediate result back into the prompt context. However, note that if you are using a parse function (like openai.response.parse), you must ensure that the final output is still well-formed JSON. Having the model generate a partial or “reasoning” block in the same response can risk output that breaks JSON formatting.  \n   • Structure the Conversation: If you show the previous step’s (tool’s) output in the conversation, make it clear to the model that it should consider that output but not merely restate it in the final JSON. You might say: “Above is the tool’s output, and now create the final summary in JSON format, referencing the tool output as needed.”\n\n2. Handling JSON Responses  \n   • Enforce a JSON Schema: If you are expecting specific fields, define that schema as precisely as possible in your prompt (e.g., keys must be “title”, “answer”, “tags”…).  \n   • Validate or Parse Rigorously: Even if the model is instructed to return JSON, it may produce extraneous text or formatting. Use robust JSON parsing/validation in your code to handle and recover from any parsing errors. Tools like openai.response.parse can help, but you will still want to wrap parsing in try-catch (or equivalent) logic.  \n   • Key-Value Consistency: If you are mapping the model’s fields to typed structures on your server side, ensure that the field names match exactly (case-sensitive) and that the model is instructed to avoid introducing extra keys or changing required key names.\n\n3. Context Management and State  \n   • Pass the Relevant Information Back: When the AI needs to consider the output of a tool as part of the next response, you have to pass that output back in the new prompt or conversation context. The model does not inherently store states internally; “memory” must be re-supplied in each round of API calls.  \n   • Avoid Prompt Confusion: If you pass the entire tool output in the prompt, keep it separate from your final instructions to reduce the chance that the AI merges them in the same block of text. You can do this with markup in your prompt like “Tool Output: … End of Tool Output.” and then say “Now, produce the final JSON.”\n\n4. Chaining Tools and AI Responses  \n   • Intermediate vs. Final Output: If there are multiple steps, consider whether each step is well-defined and isolated. You can run each AI prompt step, parse the results, store them, and then feed only the relevant portion into the next prompt. This approach makes debugging easier if something goes wrong.  \n   • Token and Response Length Limits: Each intermediate result appended to the prompt can increase your overall token usage. Factor in the maximum tokens for the model you are using (for example, GPT-3.5 vs GPT-4 have different token limits).\n\n5. Error Handling  \n   • Retry Logic: Sometimes the model might return invalid JSON or hallucinate structure. You might have to implement a fallback or “Please re-format your answer in valid JSON” step if the parse fails.  \n   • Partial Results and Recovery: If you partially parse a valid JSON structure but detect missing or unexpected fields, prompt again or gracefully handle the missing data on the server side.\n\n6. Security and Privacy  \n   • Scrub or Filter Sensitive Data: If the tool’s output contains sensitive or user-specific data, ensure you are not accidentally returning private information in the final JSON.  \n   • Be Careful with System Instructions: If you have sensitive logic or instructions in the system message, be sure your logging or front-end does not expose them.  \n\n7. Maintaining Clarity in Code  \n   • Good Abstraction Layers: Keep your parse logic, prompt building, and output validation separate so that you can better pinpoint issues.  \n   • Logging and Observability: Log what prompts (and system instructions) are sent to the API, as well as the raw AI output, before parsing. This helps debug if the JSON or format is incorrect.\n\nBy adhering to these considerations—focusing on prompt design, JSON schema enforcement, context management, and robust error handling—you can reliably integrate your MCP server with the OpenAI responses API and produce valid, well-structured JSON that incorporates outputs from your tool in each step.",

You then let the AI “reflect on” that output before producing its final answer, but this final answer must match a precise JSON schema.\n3. You’ve discovered that things work smoothly when you use text: format: \"…\", but you’re aware there are additional factors to consider.\n\nNow, let’s think together about what could be critical in such a setup:\n\n• Consistent Output Formats: How do you ensure that both intermediate and final outputs adhere strictly to the expected format?  \n  – If you’re relying on text: format: \"…\" then the structure of that text has to be predictable.  \n  – How might you validate that the output indeed conforms to your JSON schema?\n\n• Schema Validation: What mechanisms do you have in place to check if the final answer (which is expected to match a schema) is valid JSON?  \n  – Do you use schema validation libraries or custom checks?  \n  – Consider what happens if the AI produces output that is valid as text but does not adhere to your JSON constraints.\n\n• Chaining and Context Preservation: When the AI “considers” an intermediate output, what are the challenges in maintaining context?  \n  – How do you pass the intermediate result back into the prompt without losing details, or inadvertently altering meaning?  \n  – In chain-of-thought systems, ensuring that prior steps are reliably accessible is crucial.\n\n• The Role of the Parsing Tool: With openai.response.parse, how do you manage parsing errors?  \n  – Are there safeguards if the parse step fails?  \n  – What logging or fallback mechanisms might you put in place?\n\n• Token and Computational Limits: Are you mindful of token limits across multiple API calls, especially when chaining intermediate outputs?  \n  – How do you keep prompts concise yet complete?\n\n• Iterative Refinement and Error Correction: What if the intermediate output has slight deviations or unexpected formatting errors?  \n  – Do you have iterative correction routines in your conversational loop?\n\nBy reflecting on these points:\n1. Maintaining consistency between text-formatted outputs and the specific JSON schema is central.\n2. Validating the final output against the schema (and handling exceptions) is a key technical consideration.\n3. Ensuring that the chaining of intermediate outputs into the final prompt context doesn’t introduce ambiguity or error can be complex.\n4. And finally, making sure that each component—the MCP server, the openai.response.parse tool, and the AI model—plays nicely together is fundamental.\n\nWhat do you think might be the most challenging part of this integration?",

          "response": "Absolutely, let's break down your scenario in abstract terms:\n\n### 1. Conceptual Components\n\n- **MCP Server**: This is your \"orchestrator\" or middleware. It receives requests and coordinates interactions between various services (in this case, OpenAI's APIs and any tools you might be using).\n- **OpenAI Response API**: You're using this to generate or process language outputs, and specifically utilizing openai.response.parse, which is likely a helper for parsing structured outputs (like function/tool calls).\n- **Tool Output**: You have a tool (maybe a function or external service) that you want the AI to \"consider\" before it creates a final answer.\n- **Final Output in JSON Schema**: The AI's ultimate response must conform to a specific JSON structure.\n\n### 2. Abstract Process Flow\n\n1. **User Query → MCP Server**: A user sends a request.\n2. **MCP Server → OpenAI (w/ Tool Use)**: MCP asks OpenAI to process the request, possibly with instructions to use a tool (via function calling or similar).\n3. **OpenAI → Tool**: OpenAI decides to call a tool, which generates a result/output.\n4. **Tool → OpenAI**: The tool returns its result to OpenAI.\n5. **OpenAI (with tool result) → Final Output**: OpenAI considers the tool output and generates a final answer, which must fit a defined JSON schema.\n6. **MCP Server → User**: The server returns this structured response to the user.\n\n### 3. Why text: format works\n\nWhen you specify text: format, you're getting the model to output plain text, which is easy to parse or process as you wish.\n\n- **Structured Output Issues**: When you want the model to output a specific JSON schema, you need to ensure that:\n    - The model is aware of the schema and instructed to use it.\n    - The tool's output is injected or referenced in the final completion.\n    - The model has \"seen\" the tool output before it generates the final JSON.\n\n### 4. Abstract Challenges\n\n- **State Management**: OpenAI's function calling (or tool calling) is a multi-step process; you need to pass the tool output back to the model as context before it produces the final output.\n- **Schema Adherence**: LLMs sometimes hallucinate structure. Using a tool like openai.response.parse helps, but only if the model's prompt and instructions are clear and the process flow is managed correctly.\n\n### 5. Abstract Solution\n\n- **Iterative Reasoning**: Treat the process as a multi-step reasoning chain.\n    - Step 1: Ask the model what tools/functions it needs, or provide the query with tool-using instructions.\n    - Step 2: When the tool is called, take its output and \"feed\" it back to the model, asking it to generate the final answer using that result, adhering to your JSON schema.\n- **Prompt Engineering**: Be explicit in your prompt about the format and that the model must \"consider\" the tool's output before answering.\n- **API Flow**: Your MCP server must manage the multi-turn conversation (tool call → result → final output).\n\n### 6. Abstract Pseudocode\n\n```python\n# Pseudocode for orchestration logic\nuser_input = get_user_input()\n\n# Step 1: Generate tool call from OpenAI\ntool_call_response = openai.chat_completion(\n    prompt=...,  # includes info about tool use\n    functions=[...]\n)\n\nif tool_call_response.indicates_tool_call():\n    tool_output = call_tool(tool_call_response.tool_args)\n    # Step 2: Feed tool output back to model for final response\n    final_response = openai.chat_completion(\n        prompt=f\"Here is the tool output: {tool_output}. Now, generate the final response in this JSON schema: ...\",\n        previous_messages=[...]\n    )\n    return final_response\n```\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nIn the abstract, your system is a multi-step orchestrator: you gather a tool's output, ensure the AI \"considers\" it, and then direct the AI to generate a schema-conforming final output. The key is to manage stateful, multi-turn interactions so the model always has the necessary context (including prior tool results) before generating its final JSON-formatted answer.\n\nLet me know if you'd like a more concrete example or code snippet tailored to your setup!",

          "response": "Below is one way to think about it in purely abstract terms, focusing on components and data flow regardless of specific programming details. It might help clarify how you can set up your MCP server, the OpenAI responses API, and your JSON schema requirements in a “pipeline” or multi-step fashion:\n\n───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n1. The “Tool” / MCP Server as a Processor\n───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n• You have some external process or “tool” (the MCP server) that produces or transforms data.  \n• Conceptually, you can treat this server like a black box: it takes input (commands, data, queries) and returns output in some intermediate form (e.g., text outputs, JSON, or some structured format).  \n\n───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n2. OpenAI “Interpretation” Layer (via openai.response.parse)\n───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n• After the MCP server’s output is collected, you then use the OpenAI API to interpret or transform that output further.  \n• In abstract terms, your “interpretation layer” might do things like:  \n  (a) Read the output from your tool.  \n  (b) Parse and analyze it.  \n  (c) Possibly break it down into smaller pieces for better AI processing.  \n  (d) Generate a higher-level or more contextually relevant representation of the data.  \n\n• In practical terms, this might look like calling an OpenAI endpoint and feeding it a user/system prompt that includes the MCP server’s output. You might specify an instruction in your prompt such as “Consider the following output from MCP” and then ask the model to produce a final JSON.\n\n───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n3. The “Chaining” Approach (Two-Step Processing)\n───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n• Once you have your initial text-based output (from the MCP server) in step 1, you can do a second pass by providing that text to OpenAI in a new prompt.  \n• In the second pass, you instruct OpenAI to transform that text into the final format you need (for example, a certain JSON structure).  \n• Conceptually, you are chaining two operations:\n   (1) “Generate or gather raw data” (your tool’s job).  \n   (2) “Transform data into the required final format” (the OpenAI interpretation job).  \n\n• If it only works with text format “?”, it often means that your code expects text-based input and must parse that text, or that your approach to feed the output back into the model only handles string data. It’s generally easier to pass around text (like the “?” portion) rather than a more structured or multiline JSON if your code is set up to parse or read those lines in a specific way.\n\n───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n4. Final Output in a JSON Schema\n───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n• Ultimately, you instruct the OpenAI model: “Given the text-based analysis from the MCP server, output a JSON object that has the following keys: ….”  \n• The key idea is that your final “call” to the model is the step that imposes your JSON schema requirements.  \n• Typically, you might use a system or user instruction that declares:  \n  {\n    “fieldA”: <some data derived from tool output>,  \n    “fieldB”: <some data derived from tool output>  \n    ...\n  }\n• Or you can specify the schema in an OpenAI function call if you’re using the function-calling approach (depending on your OpenAI library version).\n\n───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n5. Summary of High-Level Data Flow\n───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n1) Your MCP server does some processing.  \n2) You retrieve the server’s output (text or partial JSON).  \n3) You feed that data into OpenAI (through openai.response.parse or a similar mechanism).  \n4) OpenAI interprets or expands upon that data according to your instructions.  \n5) The final output is returned in your specified JSON schema format.  \n\nConceptually, it helps to think of each stage as a step in a pipeline:  \n• The first half (MCP server) is your domain-specific tool.  \n• The second half (OpenAI) is your AI-based “translator” or “summarizer” of that tool’s output.  \n\nWhenever something “only works” in a text-based prompt style, it often means your pipeline is wired to deal with string inputs to the AI, and not fully configured to accept or output structured data directly. To address this, you either (1) ensure the data from the MCP server is serialized into text so OpenAI can parse it, or (2) if possible, pass structured data to the OpenAI function-calling feature so it can handle JSON natively.  \n\n───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nIn essence, the conceptual model is:\n• Use your MCP server as the “raw data/partial result generator.”  \n• Pass that data to OpenAI, telling it “please transform or interpret this data into the final JSON format.”  \n• Ensure your code or prompt-handling can reliably parse the AI’s output or adapt function-calling to ensure you get valid JSON in the end.",

Think of it as a tool that parses, filters, or re-formats raw data into a more useful form—a “pre-processed” result.\n\n • Stage 2 – Contextual Finalization: This intermediate output is then handed off to the OpenAI responses API, using something like openai.response.parse with a defined JSON schema. Here, the AI takes the earlier result as context, “considers” it, and then generates a final output that fits your specified schema. This step refines the answer, ensuring that it adheres to the structure and additional context you need.\n\nIn an abstract sense, this is similar to building a layered reasoning system: the first layer distills and prepares the data, and the second layer builds on that to produce a structured, fully formed response. Each layer has its own responsibilities, and the output of one becomes a critical input for the next. This modularity can help in complex systems by isolating concerns—handling parsing, transformation, and output formatting in discrete stages.\n\nBy using this pipeline, you effectively guide the AI’s response, ensuring that its final output is both informed by earlier processing and compliant with the desired structured format.",

          "response": "It sounds like you're working on a workflow where:\n\n1. You have an MCP server interacting with the OpenAI API.\n2. You use openai.response.parse (possibly a wrapper or method for parsing responses/tools).\n3. You want to:\n   - Get an output from a tool (presumably via a function/tool call).\n   - Have the AI consider that tool output before producing a final output in a particular JSON schema.\n4. It works if you use text: format: '....'\n\nBut your question seems to be: Why does it only work when you use text: format: '...' and not when you use your intended JSON schema? Or, perhaps: How can you get the AI to reliably incorporate tool outputs into a final JSON-formatted result?\n\nLet's clarify and help you with this scenario:\n\n## Understanding the Problem\n\n- **Text format works:** If you prompt the AI for a plain text answer (e.g., \"What lessons can we learn from this?\"), you get what you expect.\n- **JSON schema desired:** You want the AI to output a structured response (in JSON) that takes into account the output of a tool (e.g., historical analysis, summary, etc.).\n\n## Common Issues and Solutions\n\n### 1. Ensuring Tool Output is Provided to the Model\n\nWhen using OpenAI's function calling or tool integration, the workflow is typically:\n\n1. User sends a prompt.  \n2. Model may decide a tool (function) should be called.  \n3. Tool is called; output is sent back to the model as part of the conversation context (in a tool_message or function_response, depending on the library).\n4. Model then produces a final answer, potentially incorporating the tool output.\n\n**If your final output isn't incorporating the tool's result, check:**\n\n- Is the tool's output being correctly inserted back into the conversation context as a message the model can \"see\"?\n- Is your prompt clearly instructing the model to use prior tool outputs when generating the JSON?\n\n### 2. Prompting the Model to Output JSON\n\nIf you want the final output in a JSON schema, you must:\n\n- Provide a clear, in-context example of the desired schema.\n- Instruct the model to include the tool output in the relevant field(s) of the JSON.\n\n**Example prompt:**\n\n```plaintext\nYou are an AI historian. Use the output of the analysis tool to answer the question. Output your answer in the following JSON schema:\n\n{\n  \"summary\": \"\",\n  \"lessons\": \"\",\n  \"tool_output\": \"\"\n}\n\nTool output: <tool_output_here>\n\nNow, fill in the JSON using the tool output.\n```\n\n### 3. Ensuring Correct Parsing\n\nIf you use openai.response.parse or similar, make sure:\n\n- The model's output is valid, parseable JSON.\n- You use a stop sequence or system prompt to tell the model \"Only output JSON.\"\n\n### 4. Why \"text: format: ...\" works\n\nWhen you use a plain text format, the model is unconstrained and can just answer. When you use a JSON schema, unless your prompt and API call are set up to reinforce strict JSON output, the model may default to plain text.\n\n## Example: Structured, Tool-Aware Output\n\nHere is a possible approach:\n\n**Step 1:** Call the tool (e.g., historical analysis), get its output.\n\n**Step 2:** Give the tool output and a prompt to the model, such as:\n\n```plaintext\nGiven the following tool output, answer the question and output in the following JSON schema.\n\nTool output:\n\"Battle of Exampleville was poorly handled due to lack of supplies and communication.\"\n\nJSON schema:\n{\n  \"summary\": \"\",\n  \"lessons\": \"\",\n  \"tool_output\": \"\"\n}\n\nFILL IN THE JSON:\n```\n\n**Step 3:** Parse the model's output as JSON.\n\n## Troubleshooting Checklist\n\n- [ ] Is the tool output being correctly inserted in the prompt/context?\n- [ ] Is the prompt clear about using the tool output and the required schema?\n- [ ] Is the model instructed (preferably in the system prompt) to ONLY output valid JSON, and nothing else?\n- [ ] Are you using openai.response.parse or a similar method to extract and validate the JSON from the model's reply?\n- [ ] If using GPT-4 or GPT-3.5-turbo function calls, are you returning the tool output via the function_response and then prompting the model for the final answer?\n\n## If Still Not Working\n\n- Share example prompts and outputs for more specific help.\n- Indicate which OpenAI API features (function calling, tools, etc.) and SDK version you are using.\n- Paste a sample of your workflow so I can give more direct feedback.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nIf it \"only works\" with text: format: ..., it's likely your prompt or API workflow isn't clearly presenting the tool output and required JSON schema to the model in a way that guides it to use both. Rework your prompt to make both explicit, and ensure your system is passing the tool output back into the model's context before the final response.\n\nIf you share your current prompt and workflow, I can help you refine it further!",

          "response": "Below are some tips and guidelines that may help you get an intermediate JSON output back from your “tool” (the MCP server) in order for the AI to consider that intermediate output—and then produce a final JSON output—in a predictable, parseable format using OpenAI APIs:\n\n──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n1. STRUCTURE PROMPTS FOR JSON OUTPUT\n──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n• In your final prompt to OpenAI (the one that should yield JSON), clearly instruct the model to respond with valid JSON only.  \n• An example “system” or “user” prompt segment often looks like:\n\n  \"You are given the following context:\n   1) The user’s question\n   2) The tool’s output (in JSON)\n\n   Please produce valid JSON according to this schema:\n   {\n     \"insight\": \"string\",\n     \"lessonsLearned\": \"string\"\n   }\n\n   Return ONLY valid JSON—no additional text or formatting.\"\n\n• By emphasizing “Return ONLY valid JSON,” you reduce the chance that the response contains extra text that breaks parsing.\n\n──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n2. PASS THE INTERMEDIATE OUTPUT BACK INTO THE MODEL\n──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n• When you get an output from the MCP server, ensure that you store it as data (e.g., in a variable) and feed it back to OpenAI as part of the next prompt’s context. For instance:\n\n  1. response_from_mcp = call_MCP_server(...)  \n  2. Then place response_from_mcp into your next prompt:\n     \"We have the following preliminary data from the tool: {response_from_mcp}. \n      Please incorporate that data to produce a final JSON result.\"\n\n• If the intermediate output is already structured JSON, embed it in triple backticks or a code block to avoid formatting issues when you include it in the prompt. For example:\n\n  \"The intermediate output from the tool is:\n   ```\n   { ...the JSON... }\n   ```\n   Please incorporate that into your final JSON response.\"\n\n──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n3. VALIDATE AND REPAIR JSON IF NEEDED\n──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n• Sometimes, the AI or external tools produce JSON with trailing text (like explanations or decorative language).  \n• After receiving a response from OpenAI, you can run a quick JSON parsing step in your code:\n\n  import json\n\n  try:\n      final_data = json.loads(ai_response)\n  except json.JSONDecodeError:\n      # Optionally, strip out or fix common formatting issues here\n\n• This validation step ensures your final output is well-formed JSON. If you consistently see extra text, refine your prompt:\n\n  \"Return only the JSON, with no additional commentary.\"\n\n──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n4. USE FUNCTION-CALLING FEATURES (IF APPLICABLE)\n──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n• If you are using OpenAI’s newer models that support function calling (e.g., GPT-3.5 or GPT-4 with function calling), you can specify a function schema. The AI will then provide its output in a JSON-like structure that can be programmatically accessed. For instance, you define a function signature in your request, and the model will return the arguments in a structured format.\n\n• Example (in Python-like pseudocode):\n\n  response = openai.ChatCompletion.create(\n      model=\"gpt-4-0613\",\n      messages=[\n          {\"role\": \"system\", \"content\": \"You are a helpful assistant.\"},\n          {\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"Analyze this text and provide insights: 'Was poorly handled. What lessons can we learn?'\"}\n      ],\n      functions=[\n          {\n              \"name\": \"return_insights\",\n              \"description\": \"Return insights in JSON\",\n              \"parameters\": {\n                  \"type\": \"object\",\n                  \"properties\": {\n                      \"insight\": {\"type\": \"string\"},\n                      \"lessonsLearned\": {\"type\": \"string\"}\n                  },\n                  \"required\": [\"insight\", \"lessonsLearned\"]\n              },\n          }\n      ],\n      function_call={\"name\": \"return_insights\"}\n  )\n\n  # The model’s response will include a “function_call” block with structured JSON ‘arguments’.\n\n──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n5. EXAMPLE FLOW\n──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n1) Prompt your MCP server for some data:\n   tool_output = call_MCP_server(\"Explain the historical context...\")\n\n2) Use that output in your next OpenAI prompt. For example:\n   prompt = f\"\"\"\n   You have this tool output:\n   {tool_output}\n\n   Based on this data, please produce a final JSON response as follows:\n   {{\n     \"insight\": \"string describing the main takeaway\",\n     \"lessonsLearned\": \"string listing lessons from the tool_output\"\n   }}\n\n   Return ONLY valid JSON (no extra text).\n   \"\"\"\n\n3) Send that prompt to OpenAI via openai.ChatCompletion.create or whichever endpoint you prefer. Then parse the response in Python:\n   response = openai.ChatCompletion.create(model=..., messages=[{\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": prompt}])\n   final_data = json.loads(response.choices[0].message[\"content\"])\n\n4) Use final_data[\"insight\"] or final_data[\"lessonsLearned\"] as needed.\n\n──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nSUMMARY\n──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n• The key is to (a) strictly define a JSON schema in your prompt, (b) minimize additional text in the model’s response, (c) pass the intermediate output from your tool as context in the next prompt, and (d) validate or parse the final JSON. Optional: use function-calling features in newer OpenAI models for a more robust approach. \n\nFollowing these steps should help ensure your “historical case study” output flows cleanly from the MCP server into the AI’s final JSON result.",

Be rigorous with formatting.  \n • When you’re feeding data between systems (here, the tool output to be considered later in a JSON schema), even small differences—like how you quote or structure a key (for example, using text: format: ' vs. another variant)—can lead to different behaviors.  \n • It reinforces the importance of explicitly defining your desired format in prompts and ensuring it exactly matches what your parser expects.\n\n2. Test components in isolation.  \n • When multiple tools or steps are chained (MCP server output, tool parsing, AI final output), verify each part–especially where formatting is concerned–to see exactly how it is being interpreted.  \n • This helps in identifying if a misinterpretation (or mis-formatting) is happening at one particular stage.\n\n3. Clarify integration boundaries and expectations.  \n • Your case demonstrates that when using intermediate outputs (the tool’s output) as an input for later processing, you must be very clear about the schema and avoid ambiguous instructions that might lead the AI to “misunderstand” the input.\n • Document and enforce a strict schema so the AI can reliably parse and integrate the information.\n\n4. Small differences can have outsized impacts.  \n • The fact that the behavior changes based on a seemingly minor formatting difference is an important lesson. In robust integrations, you want to design your input/output routines to be as explicit and unambiguous as possible.\n • Using standardized keys, consistent quotes, and following JSON schema guidelines helps avoid subtle errors.\n\nIn summary, your case study highlights the need for careful and explicit format management when integrating different systems. By testing components individually, rigorously enforcing the correct output schema, and being mindful of subtle formatting differences, you can reduce integration issues and ensure the final output is consistent with your requirements.",

This may involve parsing the JSON data, checking for required fields, and handling any unexpected or malformed input.\n\n3. **Debugging and Logging**: Enable detailed logging in both the MCP server and the OpenAI Responses API integration to help identify the root cause of the issue. This can include logging the request and response payloads, as well as any error messages or exceptions that are being thrown.\n\n4. **Error Handling**: Implement proper error handling mechanisms to gracefully handle any errors or exceptions that may occur during the integration process. This can include providing meaningful error messages to the user, retrying the request, or falling back to a default behavior.\n\n5. **Iterative Development and Testing**: Adopt an iterative development and testing approach to gradually build and refine the integration between the MCP server and the OpenAI Responses API. Start with simple test cases, verify the integration at each step, and gradually increase the complexity as you progress.\n\n6. **Consult Documentation and Community**: Thoroughly review the documentation for both the MCP server and the OpenAI Responses API to ensure that you are following the recommended integration practices. Additionally, consider reaching out to the community or support channels for these tools to get assistance from experienced users or developers.\n\n7. **Optimize for Performance**: Depending on the volume of requests and the complexity of the integration, you may need to optimize the performance of the overall system. This may involve implementing caching mechanisms, optimizing network communication, or leveraging asynchronous processing techniques.\n\nBy addressing these lessons and taking a systematic approach to troubleshooting and improving the integration, you should be able to resolve the issue and successfully use the MCP server in conjunction with the OpenAI Responses API to achieve your desired output.",

Try separating them:\n\n```python\n# Option A: Two-step process\nstep1 = client.chat.completions.create(\n    model=\"gpt-4\",\n    messages=messages,\n    tools=mcp_tools\n)\n\nstep2 = client.beta.chat.completions.parse(\n    model=\"gpt-4\", \n    messages=updated_messages,\n    response_format=schema\n)\n\n# Option B: Use function calling instead of tools\nresponse = client.beta.chat.completions.parse(\n    model=\"gpt-4\",\n    messages=[{\n        \"role\": \"user\",\n        \"content\": f\"Using this data: {mcp_data}, analyze and respond in JSON format\"\n    }],\n    response_format=schema\n)\n```\n\n### 3. **MCP Server Integration Issues**\n\n```python\n# Ensure MCP server responses are properly formatted\nasync def get_mcp_data(query):\n    # Your MCP server call\n    result = await mcp_server.call_tool(tool_name, parameters)\n    \n    # Ensure result is serializable\n    if isinstance(result, dict):\n        return json.dumps(result)\n    return str(result)\n\n# Include MCP data in prompt context\nmcp_data = await get_mcp_data(\"historical case analysis\")\nresponse = client.beta.chat.completions.parse(\n    model=\"gpt-4\",\n    messages=[{\n        \"role\": \"user\",\n        \"content\": f\"\"\"\n        Historical data: {mcp_data}\n        \n        Based on this data, what lessons can we learn? \n        Respond in the specified JSON format.\n        \"\"\"\n    }],\n    response_format=YourSchema\n)\n```\n\n### 4. **Debug the Flow**\n\n```python\nimport logging\n\nlogging.basicConfig(level=logging.DEBUG)\n\n# Add debugging\nprint(\"MCP Tool Result:\", tool_result)\nprint(\"Messages before parse:\", messages)\nprint(\"Schema:\", YourSchema.model_json_schema())\n\ntry:\n    response = client.beta.chat.completions.parse(...)\n    print(\"Parsed response:\", response.choices[0].message.parsed)\nexcept Exception as e:\n    print(\"Parse error:\", e)\n    print(\"Raw response:\", response.choices[0].message.content)\n```\n\n## What specific error are you seeing?\n\nCould you share:\n1.

          "response": "Choosing a suitable theoretical foundation for a dissertation that involves building and orchestrating an AI-driven pipeline (in your case, an MCP server coordinating with OpenAI’s API and JSON-schema outputs) depends largely on the questions you want to address and the nature of your research. Below are a few common theoretical frameworks and how they might fit your project; you can select or combine them based on your disciplinary focus (e.g., Computer Science, Information Systems, HCI, Software Engineering, etc.) and your research objectives.\n\n1) Design Science Research (Hevner et al.)  \n• Overview: Design Science Research (DSR) provides a structured way to create and evaluate IT artifacts (such as software frameworks, prototypes, or algorithms).  \n• Relevance: If your dissertation aims to build a novel software system or architecture that integrates the MCP server with OpenAI’s responses and JSON schemas, DSR offers a strong framework to guide iterative design, implementation, and evaluation.  \n• Focus:  \n  – Artifacts: The pipeline itself (the MCP server, the prompt/response mechanism, and the JSON schema output).  \n  – Design Cycles: Problem identification, artifact design/build, and performance evaluation (e.g., how accurate or effective is the pipeline?).  \n  – Rigor vs. Relevance: Balancing academic rigor (theory and literature) with practical relevance (real-world usability/testing).  \n\n2) Knowledge Representation and Reasoning (KRR) in AI  \n• Overview: KRR examines how knowledge can be formally captured so that machines can utilize it effectively—this includes logic-based approaches, semantic frameworks, and schema-based modeling.  \n• Relevance: If you are exploring how intermediate outputs (e.g., partially parsed text from OpenAI) get transformed into a final structured representation (JSON schema), theories in KRR could provide a solid foundation.  \n• Focus:  \n  – Symbolic vs. Connectionist Approaches: The interplay between large language models (LLMs) and traditional symbolic representation (your JSON schemas).  \n  – Enrichment/Transformation: The theoretical underpinnings of how you “interpret” or transform unstructured data into structured knowledge.  \n\n3) Distributed Systems and Service-Oriented Architecture  \n• Overview: Theoretical perspectives around distributed systems focus on scalability, reliability, concurrency, and communication protocols among services or microservices.  \n• Relevance: If your core research question is about how best to orchestrate a distributed pipeline—where an MCP server calls out to OpenAI’s API, processes results, and manages final transformations—looking to service-oriented architecture (SOA) principles could be beneficial.  \n• Focus:  \n  – Architectural Patterns: Client-server, microservices, message passing.  \n  – Middleware Theories: How your MCP server (middleware) coordinates with external AI endpoints and various data formats.  \n  – Performance Analysis: Throughput, latency, and fault tolerance.  \n\n4) Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) and Mixed-Initiative Interaction  \n• Overview: HCI theories (e.g., Activity Theory, Distributed Cognition) explore how users interact with computational artifacts and how those tools mediate tasks. Mixed-initiative frameworks look specifically at systems where humans and AI collaborate iteratively.  \n• Relevance: If part of your dissertation involves user-driven prompts or the supervision of AI outputs (and the system must refine outputs based on user feedback), HCI theories could offer a lens to examine user goals, system feedback, and iterative refinement.  \n• Focus:  \n  – Activity Theory (Engeström): Understanding the relationships and mediations among the user, the pipeline (tool), and the goal or object of activity.  \n  – Mixed-Initiative Interaction: Determining when AI or the user should drive the process and how the system transitions control between them.  \n\n5) Grounded Theory (Glaser & Strauss)  \n• Overview: Grounded Theory (GT) is a qualitative research methodology often used to generate theory directly from data.  \n• Relevance: If your research question involves collecting and analyzing qualitative data—for instance, transcripts of user interactions, error logs, or user feedback about the pipeline’s outputs—you might employ GT to inductively derive insights about system usage or improvement points.  \n• Focus:  \n  – Data-Centric: Gather usage logs or interviews, code them, find emerging themes that inform design or system improvements.  \n  – Iterative Development of Theory: Let your findings shape the theoretical underpinnings of how AI and server orchestration should be approached.  \n\n6) Sociotechnical Systems or Actor-Network Theory (ANT)  \n• Overview: These theories look at the interplay between human and nonhuman “actors” (e.g., servers, AI modules, users, organizations) in a network of relationships.  \n• Relevance: If you are studying the broader impact of integrating an AI pipeline—looking beyond just software design to organizational, social, or ethical considerations—these theories help situate your technical contributions in a sociotechnical context.  \n• Focus:  \n  – ANT: Focuses on the network of actors (human and machine) and how they form alliances or “translations” to achieve outcomes.  \n  – Ethics and Governance: Considering privacy, bias, or trust issues when using AI outputs in a formal pipeline.  \n\nPutting It All Together  \nDepending on the scope of your dissertation, you may adopt one primary theoretical framework or combine elements from multiple. A common approach in dissertations that build novel software systems is:\n\n• Use Design Science Research as the overarching methodology (which helps you structure your iterative building and evaluation of the MCP/OpenAI pipeline).  \n• Incorporate core concepts of Knowledge Representation if you are articulating how partially structured outputs transition to fully structured schemas.  \n• If there is a strong user-facing component, integrate Mixed-Initiative Interaction or HCI principles to analyze how humans interact with the pipeline and shape final outputs.\n\nGuiding Questions to Select a Framework  \n1. Is your primary emphasis on the system’s architecture and technical performance? → Lean toward Design Science and Distributed Systems frameworks.  \n2. Are you primarily analyzing how knowledge is captured, structured, and reasoned about? → Knowledge Representation and Reasoning in AI.  \n3. Do you have a user-in-the-loop or a major human factors component? → Look to HCI theories (Activity Theory, Mixed-Initiative Interaction).  \n4. Are you trying to induce new theoretical insights based on data about system use or user feedback? → Grounded Theory or sociotechnical approaches.  \n5. Are you explicitly studying the network of human and machine actors in a broader context (organizational, societal)? → Actor-Network Theory or sociotechnical frameworks.\n\nUltimately, your choice also depends on the expectations of your dissertation committee and the norms of your academic discipline. Ensuring coherence between your research questions, methods, and the chosen theoretical foundation is the key to a robust dissertation proposal.",

          "response": "Below are several theoretical frameworks you might consider for grounding your work. The choice really depends on which aspect you want to emphasize (e.g., the iterative refinement, the interplay of structured and free‐form language, or the integration of heterogeneous systems):\n\n1. Iterative Refinement and Chain‐of‐Thought Reasoning:\n • This approach views output generation as a multi‐step process where early outputs are refined in later stages. Recent work on chain‐of‐thought prompting in large language models (LLMs) provides a cognitive rationale for how intermediate “reasoning” or “planning” steps can lead to more coherent and controlled final outputs.\n • Grounding your work in this framework would allow you to investigate how an initial output (even if loosely constrained) can be “parsed” or transformed into a final output that aligns with a rigid JSON schema. It connects with theories of human problem solving where intermediate representations are refined or transformed iteratively until a goal state is reached.\n\n2. Constraint Satisfaction and Schema Theory:\n • Since you are enforcing a specific JSON schema, another natural foundation is the theory of constraint satisfaction. In this view, the initial free-form output is subsequently processed under a set of hard constraints (here, the JSON schema) to yield valid results.\n • This perspective has roots not only in computer science (satisfiability problems, parsing theory) but also in cognitive science where schema theory explains how incoming information is matched against mental templates. It provides a clear framework for discussing how your system “corrects” or “maps” outputs into a fixed structure.\n\n3. Human–Machine Hybrid Intelligence and Compositionality:\n • Your system—where an MCP server acts in concert with a generative AI—embodies a hybrid approach. The idea is that symbolic or rule-based processing (the MCP’s structured output and JSON constraints) can complement the flexibility of neural language models.\n • This perspective is supported by theoretical models of compositionality in language and hybrid intelligence research, where structured, incremental reasoning is combined with the fluid, language-based capabilities of LLMs. It allows examination of how structured “chunks” or components (like your structured JSON) emerge from the interplay between free text generation and rule-governed parsing.\n\n4. Feedback Loops and Self-Reflective Processing:\n • As your tool involves feeding an output back into the system for further processing, frameworks that deal with feedback loops and self-reflection (often invoked in cognitive science as metacognition) are appropriate. These frameworks explain how systems can iteratively improve outcomes by “reflecting” on prior steps.\n • Here, you’d draw on theories of recursive processing or meta-reasoning in both human cognition and artificial systems to justify the stepwise architecture of your proposal.\n\nIn summary, if your emphasis is on the stepwise refinement—going from an initial free-form output toward a strict, schema-compliant final result—a combined theoretical foundation might be most suitable. You could ground your work in theories of iterative refinement/chain‐of‐thought reasoning (to capture the sequential, planning aspects) along with constraint satisfaction and schema theory (to capture the strict format requirements). This blend supports an understanding of how generative models can be “steered” to produce outputs that not only have semantic coherence but also obey explicit structural rules.\n\nChoosing a particular theoretical foundation (or a combination) will also frame your evaluation method and help you articulate why your MCP server and OpenAI integration is innovative. It shows how your system builds on—and extends—existing ideas about how free-form language generation can be coupled with rule-based control to yield structured, predictable outputs.",

          "response": "It seems your original question got cut off at the end. From what you've provided, my understanding is:\n\n- You have an MCP (Managed Content Platform or similar) server.\n- You're using the OpenAI API, specifically something like `openai.response.parse`, and you're trying to structure a workflow where:\n  1. You use an OpenAI tool or API endpoint to generate intermediate outputs.\n  2. You then want the AI to consider these intermediate outputs before generating a final output.\n  3. Your goal is to output a structured JSON response that adheres strictly to a predefined schema.\n\nYou mentioned that your approach works whenever you use the `text:` format prompt and ask explicitly about key learning outcomes. However, it seems you’re facing issues when attempting to generalize this approach or use it consistently with a certain JSON schema.\n\nIf the above understanding aligns with your situation, the issue you're encountering is likely related to prompt engineering, structured output formatting, and chaining responses correctly.\n\nHere’s the recommended approach clearly outlined, step-by-step, to achieve your goal:\n\n## 1. Clearly Define Each Step in the Prompt Flow:\nYou should structure your workflow clearly into separate calls or a structured prompt flow:\n\n**Step A (Initial Call)**:  \nPrompt the AI with the initial request. For example, if you're designing an educational workshop, you might first ask OpenAI to generate a detailed outline or preliminary content.\n\nExample:\n```plaintext\ntext: \"You are creating an educational workshop on [your topic]. Provide a detailed outline of the key learning outcomes participants will gain from this workshop.\"\n```\n\n**Step B (Intermediate Output)**:  \nCapture the output from the first call clearly. For example:\n```json\n{\n    \"initial_response\": \"Participants will learn the fundamentals of X, best practices of Y, and practical skills in Z...\"\n}\n```\n\n## 2. Pass Intermediate Output as Context into the Next Prompt:\nExplicitly provide that intermediate output from step A back into your next prompt to ensure the AI considers it carefully. \n\nExample second prompt:\n```plaintext\ntext: \"Considering the following initial learning outcomes: {initial_response}, refine and organize them clearly into the following JSON schema:\n{\n    \"workshop\": \"<Workshop Title>\",\n    \"learning_outcomes\": [\n        {\n            \"outcome\": \"<Outcome 1>\",\n            \"description\": \"<Detailed description of outcome 1>\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"outcome\": \"<Outcome 2>\",\n            \"description\": \"<Detailed description of outcome 2>\"\n        }\n        ...\n    ]\n}\"\n```\n\n## 3. Explicitly Specify a JSON Schema in the Prompt:\nTo consistently achieve structured JSON outputs, explicitly show the AI the JSON schema you want. The AI model is proficient at following examples and structured instructions. For example:\n\n```plaintext\ntext: \"Given this initial information: {initial_response}, provide a final structured JSON output adhering exactly to the schema below:\n\n{\n    \"workshop_title\": \"<string, short and concise>\",\n    \"key_learning_outcomes\": [\n        {\n            \"title\": \"<string, clear outcome title>\",\n            \"description\": \"<string, detailed explanation of what participants will learn>\"\n        },\n        {...}\n    ]\n}\n\nEnsure your response contains no additional text, only the JSON object.\"\n```\n\n## 4. Parse and Validate the Final Output:\nAfter receiving the structured response, use the `openai.response.parse` or appropriate JSON parsing function to convert the AI response into your application's data structures. Implement validation checks (using libraries like `jsonschema` in Python or similar solutions) to ensure the AI-generated response strictly matches your desired schema.\n\n## Example Workflow (in Python-like pseudocode):\n```python\nimport openai\nimport json\nfrom jsonschema import validate\n\n# Step 1: Initial AI Request\nprompt_initial = \"You are creating an educational workshop on [Your Topic]. What are the key learning outcomes?\"\ninitial_response = openai.ChatCompletion.create(\n    model=\"gpt-4\",\n    messages=[{\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": prompt_initial}]\n).choices[0].message.content\n\n# Step 2: Structured JSON output based on initial response\njson_schema_prompt = f\"\"\"\nConsidering this initial information: {initial_response}, please format the learning outcomes into this JSON schema exactly:\n\n{{\n    \"workshop_title\": \"<string>\",\n    \"key_learning_outcomes\": [\n        {{\n            \"title\": \"<string>\",\n            \"description\": \"<string>\"\n        }},\n        ...\n    ]\n}}\n\"\"\"\n\nfinal_response = openai.ChatCompletion.create(\n    model=\"gpt-4\",\n    messages=[{\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": json_schema_prompt}]\n).choices[0].message.content\n\n# Step 3: Parse and Validate JSON\nresult_data = json.loads(final_response)\n\n# Define your JSON Schema for validation\nschema = {\n    \"type\": \"object\",\n    \"properties\": {\n        \"workshop_title\": {\"type\": \"string\"},\n        \"key_learning_outcomes\": {\n            \"type\": \"array\",\n            \"items\": {\n                \"type\": \"object\",\n                \"properties\": {\n                    \"title\": {\"type\": \"string\"},\n                    \"description\": {\"type\": \"string\"}\n                },\n                \"required\": [\"title\", \"description\"]\n            }\n        }\n    },\n    \"required\": [\"workshop_title\", \"key_learning_outcomes\"]\n}\n\n# Validate the result\nvalidate(instance=result_data, schema=schema)\n\n# Now you can confidently use result_data in your MCP server workflow.\n```\n\n## Troubleshooting:\nIf you encounter issues where the AI includes unwanted text before or after the JSON, explicitly instruct it in your prompt:\n\n- \"Provide only a JSON object, without any additional commentary or explanations.\"\n- \"Do not include markdown or any formatting characters outside the JSON object.\"\n\n## Conclusion:\nStructured prompt engineering and intermediate result chaining are key. By clearly defining your intermediate outputs, explicitly instructing the AI to consider them, and using strict schemas and validation, you can reliably achieve your desired structured JSON output.\n\nIf this did not address your specific issue fully (perhaps due to the cutoff), please feel free to clarify or provide more details, and I'll gladly help you further.",

          "response": "Certainly! It sounds like you're orchestrating a workflow where:\n\n1. You have an MCP (Model Coordination Platform) server.\n2. You use OpenAI's API to generate intermediate outputs (possibly tool outputs).\n3. You want to parse those outputs (using something like openai.response.parse).\n4. You want the AI to consider/interpolate/reflect on those intermediate outputs before generating a final output, formatted as a specific JSON schema.\n5. You mention it works when using text: format: ‘ for risk assessment (I assume you mean specifying the response format as text).\n\nLet's break down the process and how to structure it for your use-case (“expert elicitation” for risk assessment):\n\n## 1. Initial Prompting and Tool Call\n\nYou prompt the OpenAI API (via your MCP server), possibly with a function/tool call.  \n**Example:**\n```json\n{\n  \"model\": \"gpt-4-0613\",\n  \"messages\": [\n    {\"role\": \"system\", \"content\": \"You are an expert risk assessor. Use the risk_assessment_tool to assess the input, then generate a structured risk report as JSON.\"},\n    {\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"Assess the risk of data breach in our cloud infrastructure.\"}\n  ],\n  \"tools\": [\n    {\n      \"name\": \"risk_assessment_tool\",\n      \"description\": \"Assesses risk based on input.\",\n      \"parameters\": {\n        \"type\": \"object\",\n        \"properties\": {\n          \"scenario\": {\"type\": \"string\", \"description\": \"Risk scenario to assess\"}\n        },\n        \"required\": [\"scenario\"]\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n## 2. Tool Output\n\nThe AI (or the server) calls the tool and gets an output, e.g.:\n```json\n{\n  \"tool_calls\": [\n    {\n      \"name\": \"risk_assessment_tool\",\n      \"arguments\": {\"scenario\": \"data breach in cloud infrastructure\"},\n      \"output\": {\n        \"risk_level\": \"high\",\n        \"mitigations\": [\"enable MFA\", \"encrypt data at rest\"]\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n## 3. Parsing the Tool Output\n\nYou use `openai.response.parse` (or your own logic) to extract the tool’s output.\n\n## 4. Final AI Reflection and JSON Schema Output\n\nYou now provide the AI with both the original user prompt and the tool output, asking it to generate the final response in your JSON schema.\nThis is typically done by structuring the messages like:\n```json\n{\n  \"model\": \"gpt-4-0613\",\n  \"messages\": [\n    {\"role\": \"system\", \"content\": \"Given the tool's risk assessment, generate a risk report in the following JSON schema: {\\\"risk_level\\\": string, \\\"justification\\\": string, \\\"recommendations\\\": [string]}\"},\n    {\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"Original scenario: data breach in cloud infrastructure\"},\n    {\"role\": \"assistant\", \"content\": \"Tool output: {\\\"risk_level\\\": \\\"high\\\", \\\"mitigations\\\": [\\\"enable MFA\\\", \\\"encrypt data at rest\\\"]}\"}\n  ]\n}\n```\n**Prompt tip:**  \nYou can use text-davinci-003, gpt-3.5-turbo-1106, or gpt-4-0613, and specify the format you want (\"Respond in the above JSON schema only.\").\n\n## 5. Specifying Response Format\n\nYou mention `text: format: ‘` — if you want to force the output to a JSON schema, use the `response_format` parameter (if available), or instruct the model explicitly in the prompt.\n\nExample (for OpenAI API):\n```json\n\"response_format\": { \"type\": \"json_object\" }\n```\nor in your system prompt:\n> \"Reply ONLY with a valid JSON object conforming to: {\\\"risk_level\\\": ..., ...}\"\n\n## 6. Full Workflow (Pseudocode)\n\n1. User query received by MCP server.\n2. MCP triggers AI function call (risk assessment tool), gets output.\n3. MCP parses tool output, sends another AI prompt with the tool output and asks for final JSON schema response.\n4. AI returns JSON schema, MCP server returns to user.\n\n---\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\n- If it only works with `text: format: `, ensure your prompt is very explicit and the API response mode matches your needs.\n- If using function calling, you may need to chain requests (first for tool output, second for final schema).\n- If the AI sometimes replies in plain text, always include “reply ONLY with JSON” in the prompt and, if possible, use the API’s enforced response format.\n\n---\n\n## Example Final Prompt\n\n> Given the following risk assessment tool output:\n> ```json\n> {\"risk_level\": \"high\", \"mitigations\": [\"enable MFA\", \"encrypt data at rest\"]}\n> ```\n> Generate a JSON object with:\n> - risk_level (string)\n> - justification (string)\n> - recommendations (array of strings)\n> Reply ONLY with a valid JSON object.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe process is:  \nUser prompt → Tool call (via function/tool API) → Parse tool output → Feed both user prompt and tool output to AI → AI generates final output in your specified JSON schema.\n\nIf you need a live code example (Python, etc.) or more details for a specific part, let me know!",

          "response": "Below is a general high-level workflow you can follow to have your system (MCP server) make a preliminary “tool” call, feed that result back into the OpenAI API (via openai.response.parse or a similar mechanism), and finally produce a structured JSON output. This approach can be adapted for risk assessment or any other domain where you need the AI to consider prior data before providing the final answer.\n\n──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n1. Set up your MCP server and “tool” integration  \n──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n• Your MCP server (or similar backend) is responsible for orchestrating the call sequence.  \n• The “tool” call could be any API or function call that returns data relevant to your final question (e.g., for risk assessment: look up regulatory definitions, risk metrics, or historical data).  \n\n──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n2. Obtain the intermediate “tool” output  \n──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n1) The user prompt (or your internal process) triggers the MCP server to first call the “tool.”  \n2) The tool returns some data or analysis — for instance, “riskFactors,” “likelihood,” or any relevant information.  \n3) Store this data as a temporary variable in your server’s workflow.  \n\nExample of “tool” output (before AI completion):  \n{\n  \"riskFactors\": [\"Safety\", \"Compliance\"],\n  \"likelihood\": \"Medium\",\n  \"impact\": \"High\"\n}\n\n──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n3. Feed the intermediate output into the OpenAI API  \n──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n• Next, you want GPT to consider the “tool” or intermediate data before creating the final JSON response in your desired schema.  \n• To do this, incorporate the intermediate data into your GPT prompt. For example, you can structure your prompt as follows:\n\nPrompt example (pseudocode):\n\n  system_message = \"\"\"\n  You are an expert advisor. You will receive risk assessment data from a prior step. \n  Please produce your final output as valid JSON in the following schema:\n  {\n    \"finalRiskCategory\": string,\n    \"recommendations\": [string],\n    \"explanation\": string\n  }\n  \"\"\"\n\n  user_message = \"\"\"\n  Here is the intermediate data from the tool:\n  riskFactors: [\"Safety\", \"Compliance\"]\n  likelihood: \"Medium\"\n  impact: \"High\"\n\n  Based on this data, produce your final risk assessment.\n  \"\"\"\n\n  # Then call OpenAI ChatCompletion or openai.response.parse with the messages array.  \n  # Make sure to specify you want a JSON output.\n\n──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n4. Enforce or parse JSON output  \n──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nA) Use function calling (if supported in your library):  \n   With recent OpenAI models, you can define a function schema (JSON schema) and let GPT fill in the arguments. This ensures the output is well-formed JSON.  \n\n   Example of defining a function schema (pseudocode):\n   functions = [\n     {\n       \"name\": \"produceRiskAssessment\",\n       \"description\": \"Returns risk assessment in JSON format\",\n       \"parameters\": {\n         \"type\": \"object\",\n         \"properties\": {\n           \"finalRiskCategory\": {\"type\": \"string\"},\n           \"recommendations\": {\"type\": \"array\", \"items\": {\"type\": \"string\"}},\n           \"explanation\": {\"type\": \"string\"}\n         },\n         \"required\": [\"finalRiskCategory\", \"recommendations\", \"explanation\"]\n       }\n     }\n   ]\n\n   # You then call the ChatCompletion API with these functions included, and parse the JSON from the function call response.\n\nB) Use a JSON validator or parser if function calling is not available:  \n   • Prompt GPT to strictly return JSON.  \n   • After receiving GPT’s response, parse it within your server to confirm that the output matches the schema.  \n   • If parsing fails, instruct GPT to reformat or correct the JSON output.  \n\n──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n5. Final integration  \n──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n• Once your MCP server receives the final JSON, it can be returned directly to the user, stored in a database, or further processed.  \n• If you continue a conversation (e.g., subsequent user queries), you can keep referencing the final JSON or the intermediate “tool” data.  \n\n──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nKey tips and best practices  \n──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n• Prompt clarity: Always provide the exact JSON schema you expect. Use examples in your prompt to reinforce correct formatting.  \n• Step-by-step prompting: Make sure GPT has the “tool”/intermediate data in the same or a prior turn so it can incorporate it.  \n• JSON validation: Automated validation (function calling, JSON schema libraries) helps avoid malformed JSON.  \n• Iteration & refinement: If GPT sometimes strays from JSON, wrap the response in additional instructions or use a system-level note to “always respond in JSON.”  \n\n──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n\nPutting it all together, the process is basically:\n1) Call your “tool” from the MCP server and get the relevant data.  \n2) Feed that data to GPT in a structured prompt, specifying exactly how you want the final answer to be output (JSON schema).  \n3) Parse (or directly capture) the JSON response to ensure it’s valid and in the correct format.  \n4) Return or store that JSON.  \n\nThis chain-of-calls structure should let you do a multi-step process, where GPT first considers your “tool” output before delivering the final JSON-based solution.",

Preliminary Tool Call for Risk Assessment:\n • You first send a request (via your MCP server) that instructs the tool to produce an intermediate output—specifically, a risk assessment.\n • You do this by using the text format (e.g., explicitly stating text: format: “…”) so that the tool knows to provide an answer in natural language (or a “chain‐of-thought” explanation) rather than directly outputting your final schema.\n \n2. Parsing the Intermediate Response:\n • The response from the MCP server (the risk assessment) is captured using openai.response.parse.\n • At this point, you have the tool’s “working out” or intermediate output that provides the necessary context and background analysis for your final output.\n \n3. Incorporation into Final Prompt:\n • Once you have the risk assessment, you use it as context in a subsequent request. In other words, the AI is asked to “consider” that risk assessment before generating its final output.\n • This step ensures that your final answer is informed by the earlier analysis.\n \n4. Formatting the Final Output:\n • In your final request, you instruct the AI to produce its output in a specific JSON schema.\n • This final step combines both the insights of the preliminary risk assessment and any further reasoning into a final, structured JSON response.\n \nSumming up, the overall process is:\n – Trigger an initial tool call (with text format) to get an intermediate risk assessment.\n – Parse and capture that intermediate output.\n – Use that output in a follow‐up prompt so the AI “considers” it.\n – Finally, instruct the AI to output the consolidated and final result in your desired JSON schema.\n\nThis staged, chain-of-thought approach lets you include a transparent intermediate step (risk assessment) before arriving at the final, well-structured answer.",

You want to call a tool, get its output, feed that output into an OpenAI API call, and then produce a final output conforming to a specific JSON schema.\n3. You mention using openai.response.parse and that it works when you use text: format: ‘... (your question is cut off there).\n\nLet’s break down the abstraction and conceptual flow:\n\n### Abstract Model\n\n1. **Input Layer**: An initial request or prompt enters your system.\n2. **Tool Invocation**: You call an external tool (could be code, a plugin, or another API) to get intermediate data.\n3. **Intermediate Output**: The tool returns some output, which you treat as context, data, or an augmentation to the original prompt.\n4. **AI Processing**: You send a request to OpenAI’s API, incorporating the tool’s output (and possibly the original input) into your prompt or as a function/tool call input.\n5. **Parsing/Validation**: You use openai.response.parse (or similar logic) to ensure the API’s response conforms to your required JSON schema.\n6. **Final Output**: The system returns the processed, schema-validated output to the client or next system.\n\n### Conceptual Best Practices\n\n- **Composable Steps**: Think of each stage as a pure function: Input → Tool → AI → Validator → Output.\n- **State Propagation**: Each stage receives the output of the previous as input. The state can be a context object or structured data.\n- **Schema Contracts**: Define clear contracts (schemas) for what each stage produces and expects.\n- **Error Handling**: Each step should be able to handle malformed inputs/outputs gracefully (e.g., if the tool fails, or the AI response is not valid JSON).\n- **Idempotency**: Each step, given the same input, should produce the same output, enhancing predictability and debuggability.\n\n### With OpenAI Tools/Function Calling\n\nIf you are using OpenAI’s tools or function calling:\n\n- You can define the tool/function and its expected output schema.\n- The AI model can call the tool, receive its output, and then use it in follow-up reasoning to produce the final output.\n- You can use openai.response.parse to ensure the output is valid JSON or matches your schema.\n\n### Example Flow (Pseudo-Abstract)\n\n```python\n# Pseudocode for the orchestration\n\ndef process_request(request_input):\n    # Step 1: Tool Call\n    tool_output = call_tool(request_input)\n    \n    # Step 2: AI Call (using tool output as context or input)\n    ai_response = openai.chat.completions.create(\n        model=\"your-model\",\n        messages=[\n            {\"role\": \"system\", \"content\": \"Produce output in this schema: ...\"},\n            {\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": f\"Tool output: {tool_output}. Now, ...\"}\n        ]\n    )\n    \n    # Step 3: Parse/Validate\n    final_output = openai.response.parse(ai_response, schema=your_json_schema)\n    \n    return final_output\n```\n\n### Why does it work with `text:` format?\n\nIf you mean that the pipeline works when you use a plain text format, but not when you try to enforce JSON or structured output, this is usually because:\n\n- The AI is more likely to output well-formed text than strict JSON unless prompted carefully.\n- The parse function expects exact JSON, so any deviation or extra text breaks parsing.\n\n**Mitigation:** When you want structured output, prompt the AI to only output valid JSON (no extra commentary), and use `response_format={\"type\": \"json_object\"}` if supported by your API version.\n\n---\n\n## Summary\n\n**Abstractly:**  \nYour system is a pipeline of composable steps: input → tool invocation → AI reasoning → schema validation → output. Each stage passes state to the next, with clear contracts and error handling.\n\n**Practically:**  \n- Make each step modular and stateless.\n- Use robust schema validation.\n- Be explicit in prompts when structured output is needed.\n- Use function calling/tools where possible for strict contracts.\n\nIf you have a more specific technical issue (e.g., the exact problem with non-`text:` formats or a code sample), please provide more details!",

          "response": "When you step back and look at this problem from a high-level or “abstract” perspective, it helps to think about your workflow as a structured pipeline, with each stage transforming or adding information in a clearly defined way. Below is a conceptual breakdown:\n\n1) Segregating Responsibilities (Pipelines or Stages)\n   • MCP Server Stage – This server generates or retrieves data that you want to feed into the model.  \n   • AI Parsing Stage (openai.response.parse) – This stage transforms, parses, or enriches the server output into the format or “context” needed for the next AI call.  \n   • Final JSON-Formatting Stage – The AI takes the enriched/parsed data and produces the end result in the prescribed JSON schema.\n\n2) Treating Outputs Like Intermediate Artifacts\n   • Each output (from the MCP server, from the parsed response, etc.) can be viewed as an artifact packaged in a known structure.  \n   • The AI’s job is to read the artifact, incorporate it into its reasoning, and produce a final artifact (a JSON object) that captures the end goals.  \n   • Conceptually, you can think of each artifact as an input-output “contract” for the next stage: the AI knows exactly what to expect and how it should respond.\n\n3) Leveraging Prompt Engineering to Control Format\n   • To ensure the AI’s output strictly follows a JSON schema, you can prompt it with instructions that emphasize:  \n     • “Here is the JSON schema I expect.”  \n     • “Do not include explanatory text—only valid JSON.”  \n   • If you observe the process “works whenever I use text: format: ‘…’,” it usually means the AI is more reliably interpreting your input as plain text and returning plain text. Enforcing a JSON format can require stricter instructions and gentle reminders about the desired structure.\n\n4) Enforcing Context Carryover\n   • Each new AI call should preserve the relevant data from previous steps, either by explicitly passing it forward or by summarizing it in the system/user prompt.  \n   • If you must “have the AI consider that output before making the final output,” you need to ensure that intermediate output is unambiguously included in the prompt.  \n   • You might, for instance, embed the result of openai.response.parse in the next system or user instruction to the AI:  \n     • “Given the following parsed data: {parsed_data}, produce a final JSON object conforming to the following schema…”\n\n5) Abstracting Away Mechanical Details\n   • If you want to think about these steps without getting bogged down in the underlying calls—an effective pattern is:  \n     a) Gather data from source (MCP server).  \n     b) Convert to “AI-readable” (or “context-ready”) text or structured data.  \n     c) Prompt the AI, providing the structured data plus instructions or schema.  \n     d) Retrieve final result as machine-readable JSON.  \n   • Each stage is a transformative function f(x) → y, where x might be text, data, or some context-filled format, and y is another piece of structured information.\n\nOverall, the key is to separate your pipeline into concise steps, ensure the output of each step is well-defined, and carefully prompt the AI so that it knows how to use the output of the previous step. In effect, you are doing a micro “chain-of-thought” or “chain-of-transformations,” where each stage is aware of the data it receives and the format it must return.",

It accepts inputs, manages interactions between services, and ultimately produces the structured output.\n\n2. A first layer of processing using openai.response.parse (or a similar tool) that produces an initial, intermediate response. This stage is designed to generate a specific output or sub-component that is needed later.\n\n3. A final synthesis stage where the AI “considers” or incorporates the intermediate output—almost like consulting an earlier note—then wraps it together with additional computed data or context to generate a final answer that adheres to your specific JSON schema.\n\nFrom an abstract perspective, you’re dealing with a two-phase or multi-stage reasoning process:\n • In the first phase, you extract or derive an intermediate result from a targeted processing module (openai.response.parse). Think of it as generating a “working memory” or a draft.\n • In the second phase, that output is fed back into a broader context where the AI reprocesses the information, refines its reasoning, and produces a final output in the desired, well-formed JSON format.\n\nConceptually, this resembles approaches like chain-of-thought prompting or iterative refinement. Each stage has a clear responsibility:\n – The initial stage is specialized and “expert” at producing a particular kind of output.\n – The later stage is more general—it sees the whole picture (the original prompt plus the intermediate output) and formats the final answer according to strict domain rules (the JSON schema).\n\nThis separation of concerns can be useful for complex tasks that benefit from breaking the problem down into smaller, more manageable components. It also mirrors practices in software engineering where data flows through different modules, each performing a specific transformation, before the final result is output.\n\nIn summary, you can conceptualize your system as a modular pipeline:\n • The MCP server orchestrates the flow.\n • The first transformation (via openai.response.parse) produces a useful “sub-result.”\n • The AI then uses that sub-result as context to generate a final, schema-compliant JSON response.\n\nThis multi-step, modular processing approach allows you to enforce structure and leverage specialized processing at each step while ultimately producing a coherent result meeting your requirements.",

Its responsibility is understanding requests, formulating queries, interpreting output from external tools, and synthesizing the final response.\n\n### 2. **External Tool (Your MCP Server)**  \nThis acts as a specialized external \"knowledge\" or \"computation\" provider. The MCP server provides structured outputs or information that the AI model itself cannot directly produce. You can think of it as an external specialist or oracle that can provide certain pieces of context-specific information or computations.\n\n### 3. **Structured Response Schema**  \nThis defines how the final output is formatted and presented—typically in JSON. It serves as the standardized \"interface\" or contract, ensuring predictable and consistent outputs.\n\n---\n\n## Abstract Conceptual Flow:\n\n- The AI receives a user query.\n- The AI identifies the need to call the MCP server (the external tool) to obtain specialized data.\n- The AI formulates the query, sends it to the MCP server, and obtains structured output.\n- The AI parses the MCP output (`openai.response.parse`) and integrates this external data into its reasoning context.\n- Finally, the AI generates a structured output in the required JSON schema, taking into account the external tool's results and the original request.\n\n---\n\n## Why does `format: text` work better?\n\nWhen you explicitly set `format: 'text'`, you simplify the parsing process, as the AI model deals directly with plain text responses. The AI can then naturally incorporate the parsed external tool output without additional complexity. If you leave the output format ambiguous or overly structured initially, the AI may struggle to interpret the MCP server outputs correctly.\n\n---\n\n## Recommendations (Abstract best practice):\n\n- **Explicit Input/Output Schemas:** Clearly define and document the schemas for input to the MCP server and output returned by it.\n- **Intermediate Parsing Step:** Always parse external responses explicitly before feeding them back into the AI reasoning pipeline.\n- **Contextualize Tool Output:** Give the AI clear instructions on how to handle and interpret the external tool data.\n- **Structured Final Output Schema:** Keep a strictly defined and consistent output schema for your final JSON response.\n\nThis abstraction helps maintain clarity, modularity, and ease of debugging, ensuring the AI and external tool interact smoothly and predictably.",

          "response": "# Conceptualizing MCP Server Integration with OpenAI's Response Parsing\n\nFrom an abstract perspective, what you're describing is a multi-stage information processing pipeline with feedback loops. Let me break this down conceptually:\n\n## System Architecture\n1. **Information Flow Layer**:\n   - You have an MCP server acting as a specialized knowledge or processing node\n   - OpenAI's API serves as both a processing and orchestration layer\n   - The `openai.response.parse` function serves as an interface between these systems\n\n2. **Functional Paradigm**:\n   - You're implementing a form of \"compute-then-reason\" pattern\n   - The MCP server provides a computational or data retrieval result\n   - The AI then performs meta-reasoning on that result before final output\n\n## Conceptual Framework\nWhat you're building is essentially a **deliberative reasoning system with external tool augmentation**. The system:\n\n1. Delegates specific tasks to specialized tools (MCP server)\n2. Receives and parses structured information from those tools\n3. Performs higher-order reasoning on the tool outputs\n4. Synthesizes a final response in a structured format (JSON schema)\n\n## The Format Issue\nWhen you mention it works with \"text: format: '?\", you're highlighting a protocol alignment challenge. This suggests the system expects certain formatting conventions to properly parse and route information between components.\n\nThis is conceptually similar to API contracts or communication protocols - the components need shared expectations about how information is structured to properly interpret and process it.\n\n## Solution Approach\nThe abstract solution involves establishing clear interface contracts between system components, ensuring that:\n1. The MCP server output is formatted in a way the parser can interpret\n2. The parser correctly extracts and structures the information\n3. The AI reasoning component receives properly structured input\n4. The final output adheres to your JSON schema requirements",

First call: Use tool + generate reasoning in text\n2. Second call: Transform reasoning into structured format\n\n### C. **Hybrid Approach**\nUse text format for the tool integration phase, then extract/transform to your required JSON schema.\n\n### D. **Context Reinforcement**\nStructure your system prompt to explicitly instruct the model to \"consider the tool output when generating the structured response.\"\n\n## Key Questions to Investigate\n\n1. Is the tool response being truncated or deprioritized in structured mode?\n2. Are you using the same conversation thread for both tool use and structured generation?\n3. Does the structured schema somehow conflict with referencing tool outputs?\n\nThe fundamental issue is likely that **structured generation mode** may be more rigid about what context it considers \"relevant\" to the schema generation task.\n\nWould you like me to dive deeper into any of these conceptual approaches?",

Tool Invocation:\n     - Format: text\n     - Purpose: Gather raw information\n  \n  2. AI Consideration:\n     - Input: Tool output as context\n     - Process: Reasoning/analysis\n  \n  3.

          "response": "It sounds like you’re building a system where:\n\n- You have an MCP server (let’s say this is some kind of orchestration backend).\n- You call the OpenAI API, possibly with function calling or tool use enabled.\n- You want OpenAI to call a tool (like openai.response.parse), use the output, and then have the AI consider that tool output before producing a final response in a JSON schema you define.\n- You notice that it “works” (i.e., as intended) whenever you use a text: format, but it works differently otherwise.\n\nLet’s clarify and address your question step by step:\n\n### 1. Tool Use and OpenAI Responses\n\nWhen you enable tools (functions) in the OpenAI API, you provide schemas for tools (functions) and let the model decide when and how to call them. The model can return:\n- A tool call (e.g., call openai.response.parse with arguments)\n- Or a direct text response\n\nYou can then take the tool call, run the function (parse), and provide the result back to the model as a tool response. The model can then use that tool response as context for its next output.\n\n### 2. Output in JSON Schema\n\nIf you want the final output to always be in a certain JSON schema, you need to make that very clear in your instructions/prompts and (if possible) in your function definitions.\n\n### 3. “Works with text: format: differently”\n\nThis seems to refer to the way you’re formatting your function/tool outputs, or perhaps to how you’re instructing the model.\n\n#### Possibility 1: Text vs JSON Output\n\n- **If you ask the model to return output as text:** The model may just generate prose or plain text, not following strict JSON formatting.\n- **If you ask for a specific JSON schema:** The model will do its best, but may sometimes make mistakes unless you reinforce this in your prompt and through tool schemas.\n\n#### Possibility 2: Function Calling Mode\n\n- When using function calling, the model can return function/tool calls, which you process before getting a final answer.\n- If you use the text completion mode, you’re just getting plain text, which makes it harder to enforce structure or multi-step reasoning.\n\n### What would change?\n\n- If you switch from a strict tool/function calling flow to a text-only format, you lose the explicit step where the model “waits” for tool output before giving its final answer. The model has to do everything in one go, so it can’t “see” the tool output unless you provide it up front.\n- If you use tool calls, you can enforce a sequence: (1) ask model to parse something, (2) run the parse, (3) give the result to the model, (4) get the final structured output.\n- If you use text format, you may have to do multi-step reasoning in one prompt, which is less reliable for structured workflows.\n\n### Recommendations\n\n1. **Use Function Calling (Tool Use) Mode:**  \n   This lets you chain reasoning, parse outputs, and then have the model consider those outputs before making a final decision.\n\n2. **Enforce JSON Schema:**  \n   Whether in your function definitions or in your prompt instructions, be extremely clear:  \n   “Respond ONLY in the following JSON schema: { ... }”\n\n3. **If Using Text Mode:**  \n   You must provide all relevant context (including tool outputs) in a single prompt, and the model must do all reasoning in one step. This is less reliable for complex workflows.\n\n4. **If Using Tool Mode:**  \n   The model can explicitly call tools, receive their output, and then make a final decision with all information in context.\n\n#### Summary Table\n\n| Mode                    | Multi-step Reasoning | Can Use Tool Output | Structured JSON Output | Reliability     |\n|-------------------------|---------------------|--------------------|-----------------------|-----------------|\n| Text-Only Completion    | No                  | Only if in prompt  | Sometimes             | Lower           |\n| Tool/Function Calling   | Yes                 | Yes                | Yes                   | Higher          |\n\n### Example\n\n**Tool Flow:**\n\n1. Model: “I need to parse X” → function call\n2. MCP server runs openai.response.parse(X)\n3. MCP sends result back to model as tool output\n4. Model: “Based on the parsed output, here is my final JSON: { ... }”\n\n**Text Flow:**\n\n- You must say: “Given this input X and this parsed output Y, return the final JSON in schema Z.”\n- Model tries to do everything in one shot, which is less robust.\n\n---\n\n**In summary:**  \nSwitching from tool mode to text mode removes the stepwise, context-aware reasoning from your pipeline, and makes it harder to ensure the model “considers” tool outputs before producing the final JSON. For complex, multi-step output workflows, use tool/function calling for best results.\n\nIf you want more concrete examples or sample code, let me know your exact workflow and MCP server details!",

          "response": "When you switch from using a structured JSON-oriented prompt (e.g., explicitly asking the model to “return JSON only” in its final output) to using a text‐formatted approach (e.g., “text: ...”), several things change under the hood:\n\n1. Level of Structure in the Response\n   • JSON prompts (especially if you’re using function calls or have explicitly instructed the model to return valid JSON) will cause the model to treat the problem as a “structuring” task. The model pays more attention to curly braces, commas, colons, etc.  \n   • Text-based prompts (“text: ...”) give the model more freedom to intersperse additional words, line breaks, or markup. This can lead to outputs that are human-readable but not always machine-parseable.\n\n2. How the AI Interprets the Instructions\n   • If your prompt says, “Return your answer in valid JSON,” the model is likelier to follow a strict schema. This is because it recognizes that the prompt demands specific tokens and structure (e.g., quotes around keys, no extra commentary).  \n   • If you add “text:” or do not explicitly remind the model about the JSON structure, the assistant may include extra explanatory text or stray punctuation that breaks JSON parsing.\n\n3. Compatibility with openai.response.parse or Other Parsing Tools\n   • Tools like openai.response.parse (depending on how it’s implemented) often expect a wholly valid JSON string returned from the API. Any additional text, line breaks, or incomplete braces can cause tokenization or parsing errors.  \n   • With “text:” prompts, there is a higher chance that your final output contains descriptive text before or after the JSON block (e.g., prose, disclaimers, clarifications), causing the parser to fail or partial-parse the result.\n\n4. Model Behaviors Around “Intermediate Output”\n   • If you want the AI to consider some intermediate output or “tool” output before the final result, you typically instruct the model how to incorporate that information into the final JSON. For example, you could show the AI the previously generated text or JSON object and say, “In your final response, please include the ‘result’ field using the above information.”  \n   • With text-based formatting, the AI might not clearly transition from intermediate to final output. You could end up with a more narrative style that’s not consistently parsable.\n\n5. Potential Fixes or Adjustments\n   • Reinforce instructions: If you need strict JSON, wrap your instructions in an explicit statement, for example:  \n     “Output the final answer in valid JSON only. Do not include any additional comments outside the JSON.”  \n   • Post‐processing: If your use case allows some flexibility, you can post‐process text outputs (e.g., using regex or a JSON parser library that can handle partial JSON). But this is more error-prone.  \n   • Consider function calls (if using OpenAI’s Chat Completions for newer models): You can define a function schema and ask the model to “call” that function with valid JSON arguments. This ensures you always receive structured data.\n\nIn short, switching to “text:” changes how terse and strictly‐formatted the AI’s output is. “text:” approaches favor a more human‐readable style, while JSON‐specific instructions impose a stricter structure on the reply—which in turn makes integration with parsers and subsequent tooling more robust.",

          "response": "There are a couple of key differences between relying on a plain text output versus insisting on a JSON‐schema–validated output via something like openai.response.parse. In your workflow, “text:” output and JSON‐formatted output behave differently in the following ways:\n\n1. Strictness of format and validation:\n • When you specify a JSON schema (for example, by using a tool like openai.response.parse that expects a structured JSON), the output must match that schema exactly. This means that every field and its type are predetermined and any deviation can cause validation errors.\n • By contrast, using a “text:” output generally means that you’re asking for freeform natural language. There’s no automated check that the output conforms to a particular structure.\n\n2. Incorporation of intermediate output:\n • If you’re first getting an output from your MCP server, and then having the AI “consider” that output to produce a final result, using a JSON schema forces you to integrate that intermediate information into a predefined structure. In effect, the chain-of-thought (or intermediate reasoning) must be distilled into the JSON fields.\n • With plain text, the intermediate output might blend together with your final answer in a less formally structured way; the AI’s reasoning might “leak” into the output or appear as additional commentary.\n\n3. Predictability of downstream processing:\n • A JSON–validated response is more predictable for your MCP server to parse and use further. The rigor imposed by the schema means your downstream processes can rely on a consistent structure.\n • When the response is in plain text, you might get extra formatting (such as additional lines, chain-of-thought details, or even deviations from expected tokens) that then have to be sanitized or parsed manually.\n\n4. Instruction interpretation:\n • When you specify “text:” in your instructions, the AI treats the output as unstructured text. In these cases, if you also include a “format:” or “json_schema:” directive later on (or in separate calls), the AI will have to “shift gears” and reformat its previous output to meet a different set of instructions.\n • Essentially, the difference is that a tool enforcing a JSON schema forces precision — as soon as you switch from a plain text output to a schema–validated output, you’re also implicitly changing the final output’s “dialect.” The AI must then “forget” its free–flow reasoning and only output fields that satisfy the schema.\n\nSo in summary, switching from a text output to a JSON–schema–constrained output changes:\n • The degree of structure enforced on the final answer.\n • How intermediate reasoning (or “chain‐of–thought”) is incorporated (or stripped out) in order to meet strict validation.\n • The consistency and predictability of the final output for downstream processing in your MCP server.\n\nIf your system “works” when you use text: but not when you require the JSON schema, it may be that additional reasoning or formatting in the intermediate stage is interfering with the structure needed by the final step. You’ll need to ensure that any intermediate output is either sanitized or appropriately incorporated into the JSON schema instructions so that the final output conforms exactly to what’s expected.",

          "response": "Great question! For a journalistic piece about your experience integrating an MCP server with the OpenAI API, there are several pieces of essential background information you’ll want to provide so that your readers can understand the context and significance of your work. Here’s what you should consider including:\n\n1. **What is MCP?**\n   - Briefly explain what the MCP server is (e.g., what MCP stands for, its primary function, and its typical use cases). Is it a proprietary platform, an open-source tool, or something else?\n   - Why are you using MCP in this context?\n\n2. **What is the OpenAI Responses API?**\n   - Introduce the OpenAI API, specifically the endpoints you’re using.\n   - Briefly describe what the `openai.response.parse` function does and why it's important for your setup.\n\n3. **The Integration Goal**\n   - Clearly state what you’re trying to achieve by combining MCP with OpenAI’s API. For example: Are you automating content generation, creating a conversational agent, or something else?\n   - Why is it important for the AI to \"consider\" a prior output before generating the final JSON schema? Is it for workflow, validation, enrichment, or another reason?\n\n4. **Technical Details**\n   - Outline how the integration technically works: What data is passed from MCP to OpenAI, how the response is parsed, and how you use the parsed response in your workflow.\n   - Mention the importance or role of the `text:` format in your API requests. Why does it work with this format, and what happens with other formats?\n\n5. **Challenges and Solutions**\n   - Any challenges you faced in the integration process, especially around formatting or schema validation.\n   - How you overcame them, either via technical fixes or workflow adjustments.\n\n6. **Broader Context**\n   - How common is this kind of integration?\n   - Are there alternatives to MCP or OpenAI API? Why did you choose these tools?\n   - Any implications for journalism, automation, or AI in general.\n\n**Example Paragraph:**\n\n> The MCP (Modular Command Platform) server is a workflow automation tool widely used for orchestrating complex data processing tasks. In my latest project, I integrated MCP with the OpenAI Responses API, leveraging the `openai.response.parse` function to process initial AI-generated outputs before constructing a final, structured JSON response. This setup allows the AI to first generate candidate content, which is then considered and structured according to a specific schema—essential for ensuring data consistency in automated journalism workflows. The integration works seamlessly when using the `text:` format in API requests due to its compatibility with the MCP’s parsing logic, a detail that proved crucial during development.\n\n**In summary:**  \nFor your readers to follow your story and appreciate the technical achievement, provide context on MCP, the OpenAI API, your integration goals, technical details, and the significance of your approach.\n\nIf you’d like a more tailored outline or have a specific audience in mind (e.g., technical vs. general), let me know!",

          "response": "Below is a list of background information that is commonly helpful when writing a journalistic or explanatory piece about using an MCP server in conjunction with the OpenAI Responses API (particularly when leveraging something like openai.response.parse for structured outputs):\n\n1. What an MCP Server Is\n   • Definition: Describe what MCP (Multi-User Chat Protocol or a custom server architecture) traditionally does, and how it can be adapted or extended.  \n   • Relevance: Explain why someone would adopt an MCP server instead of directly interfacing with a more standard REST or WebSocket backend.\n\n2. The OpenAI Responses API Basics\n   • Endpoints & Documentation: Note which endpoints or libraries are being used (e.g., Chat Completions, Completion endpoints, or specialized function-call style endpoints).  \n   • Use Cases: Highlight typical or recommended ways to parse OpenAI responses, especially around structured output if function calling or JSON is involved.\n\n3. How openai.response.parse Works\n   • Purpose & Mechanics: Clarify that openai.response.parse is designed to handle structured output, ensuring that the AI’s text is automatically parsed into a JSON or other structured form.  \n   • Benefits: Emphasize how this reduces the need for manual parsing and post-processing.  \n   • Limitations: Mention what kind of error handling might be necessary, or what to watch out for when the AI’s output deviates from the expected format.\n\n4. Workflow from Prompt to Final Output\n   • Process Overview:  \n     – Constructing the initial prompt or request and sending it to the AI.  \n     – Receiving the AI’s intermediary output (for example, a piece of text or JSON).  \n     – Passing the intermediary output back to the AI or to another function for further consideration.  \n   • JSON Schema: Describe how you define the JSON schema or format for the final output and how you enforce that schema. Some readers benefit from a clear example that shows an actual request and response snippet.\n\n5. Handling State or Context Across Calls\n   • Why It Matters: If the AI must “remember” or take into account the tool’s previous output or the server’s state, mention how you store and pass that context between calls.  \n   • Implementation Detail: This might involve referencing conversation history arrays, the openai.response.parse output, or custom data structures stored in your MCP server.\n\n6. Potential Edge Cases and Troubleshooting\n   • Examples: AI output that doesn’t match the schema, server-to-AI timeouts, or confusion arising from partial updates.  \n   • Tips: Describe best practices for validating and handling errors or unexpected responses.\n\n7. Security and Privacy Considerations\n   • Data Handling: If user data is involved, explain how requests to an external OpenAI API are secured.  \n   • Logging: Mention if request and response bodies are stored in logs, and any considerations around personally identifiable information (PII).\n\nIncluding this context helps readers with varying backgrounds understand why you’re using the MCP server environment, how you interface with OpenAI’s parsing functionality, and what to watch out for in practice.",

OpenAI Responses API Context  \n • A brief explanation of OpenAI’s responses API, including what kind of outputs it produces and why it’s a good choice for your application.  \n • How the API fits into your overall workflow and the transformation it performs on the initial input.\n\n3. The Role of openai.response.parse  \n • What openai.response.parse is designed to do (i.e., extract or transform output data).  \n • How you’re using this tool to create an intermediate output that the AI will “observe” and then incorporate into the final result.\n\n4. Two-Stage Output Process  \n • An explanation of the workflow: first, generating an output with a tool (using a particular format), and then having the AI incorporate that intermediate result when producing the final output.  \n • Why you need the AI to “consider” this intermediate output before finalizing the JSON schema.\n\n5. Importance of the text: Format  \n • A detailed look at why invoking text: format works reliably with your setup. For example, explain that using a consistent text-based format helps the parser reliably identify and extract the key pieces of information.  \n • How strict formatting instructions (like starting with text:) help maintain consistency and avoid common issues (such as misinterpretation of structure or stray characters).\n\n6. JSON Schema Requirements  \n • Describe the final JSON schema you expect—what fields it includes and what the data types are.  \n • Why adhering to this schema is important (e.g., for downstream processing, integration with other services, or simply ensuring data consistency).\n\n7. Integration Challenges and Solutions  \n • Any technical challenges encountered in coordinating between the MCP server, the OpenAI API, and the parser.  \n • The approach you took (like leveraging the text: format) to overcome these challenges and ensure that the final output matches the required JSON schema.\n\nBy covering these points, your article will not only detail the technical aspects of your implementation but also provide your readers a clear picture of why each component exists, how they interact, and the significance of the formatting choices you’ve made in ensuring the system’s overall reliability.",

I'll clarify the workflow and suggest some troubleshooting steps.\n\n### Typical Desired Workflow\n\n1. **First Step:**  \n   Ask the AI to use a function/tool with certain input.  \n   → Get the output from that function/tool.\n\n2. **Second Step:**  \n   Have the AI consider the function output, and then generate a final JSON output in a specific schema.\n\n### Issues You Might Be Facing\n\n- When you use format: 'text', it works (the AI gives you text you can parse), but you want structured output (JSON).\n- The AI might not be \"seeing\" the tool's output before generating the final answer.\n- Maybe openai.response.parse isn't parsing as expected.\n\n### General Approach (OpenAI Function Calling/Tools)\n\nHere's the correct order of operations (in Python-ish pseudocode):\n\n```python\nimport openai\n\n# Step 1: Prepare your tool (function) definitions\ntools = [\n    {\n        \"type\": \"function\",\n        \"function\": {\n            \"name\": \"your_tool\",\n            \"description\": \"Describe what your tool does.\",\n            \"parameters\": {...} # your tool's parameters schema\n        }\n    }\n]\n\n# Step 2: First message - ask the model to use the tool\nresponse_1 = openai.ChatCompletion.create(\n    model=\"gpt-4-0613\",  # for example\n    messages=[\n        {\"role\": \"system\", \"content\": \"You are a helpful assistant.\"},\n        {\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"Please use the tool to get XYZ.\"}\n    ],\n    tools=tools,\n    tool_choice=\"auto\",\n    response_format={\"type\": \"json_object\"}  # if you want JSON output\n)\n# The API will respond with a function_call, not a final answer\n\n# Step 3: Run your tool with the requested parameters, get the output\ntool_output = run_your_tool(response_1[\"choices\"][0][\"message\"][\"tool_calls\"][0][\"arguments\"])\n\n# Step 4: Send the tool output back to the model as an assistant message\nresponse_2 = openai.ChatCompletion.create(\n    model=\"gpt-4-0613\",\n    messages=[\n        {\"role\": \"system\", \"content\": \"You are a helpful assistant.\"},\n        {\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"Please use the tool to get XYZ.\"},\n        response_1[\"choices\"][0][\"message\"],\n        {\n            \"role\": \"tool\",\n            \"tool_call_id\": response_1[\"choices\"][0][\"message\"][\"tool_calls\"][0][\"id\"],\n            \"content\": tool_output\n        }\n    ],\n    response_format={\"type\": \"json_object\"},  # this requests JSON output\n)\n# Now the AI can consider the tool output and format a final JSON output\n\nfinal_output = response_2[\"choices\"][0][\"message\"][\"content\"]\n```\n\n### Key Points\n\n- **response_format:** Use {\"type\": \"json_object\"} for structured JSON. If you use format: 'text', you get only natural language.\n- **Tool Output:** The AI can only use the tool's output if you send it back as a message from the \"tool\" role.\n- **Schema:** If you want the final output in a specific JSON schema, you must instruct the model explicitly in your prompt (\"Output the answer in this JSON schema: {...}\") and use response_format.\n\n### Troubleshooting\n\n- If the AI ignores the tool output, check your message history/order.\n- Always pass the tool output as a message with role: \"tool\" and proper tool_call_id.\n- Make sure your schema is clear in your prompt, and use response_format.\n\n### Example Final Prompt\n\n```json\n{\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"Use the tool to get a user's favorite color, then output the result in this schema: {\\\"user\\\": string, \\\"favorite_color\\\": string}\"}\n```\n\n#### If you share more about your code, error messages, or specific schema, I can tailor this further.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nUse function calling in the two-step process, pass the tool output back, specify response_format for JSON, and clearly instruct the model on the desired schema.

          "response": "I’m sorry to hear you’re feeling overwhelmed. I’m not a mental-health professional, but I understand how frustrating it can be to hit a roadblock in your code. If you feel your distress is significant, please consider reaching out to a mental-health professional or someone you trust.\n\nIn the meantime, I can try to clarify how you might set up a workflow so that your MCP server calls the OpenAI API, processes the response with something like openai.response.parse (or a similar mechanism), and then uses that intermediate result for a final output in a JSON schema.\n\nBelow is a high-level approach and some points to check. If you can share specific code snippets or error messages (with sensitive keys removed), I can help you troubleshoot more precisely.\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n1) Understand your tools\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n• MCP Server: Depending on what you mean by MCP server, ensure your server-side code can:\n  – Receive requests and pass them along to the OpenAI API.\n  – Receive the API response, possibly parse or transform it.\n  – Provide the final output in the desired format (JSON in your case) back to the client.\n• openai.response.parse: If you’re using an official OpenAI client library, check whether openai.response.parse is from a particular SDK or library that needs special configuration. Keep in mind that OpenAI’s function calling (in the ChatCompletion API) is a bit different from older text completion. Make sure you’re using the correct method.\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n2) Decide on your JSON schema and how to combine responses\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n• Suppose you have a JSON schema you want in the end (e.g., { \"answer\": \"...\", \"summary\": \"...\" } or something similar). That means you’ll need to:\n  1. Make the initial request to OpenAI with the instructions and/or context that produce the partial output you need.\n  2. Parse that partial output with your code or with openai.response.parse. Validate that you have exactly the data you expect back.\n  3. Make a second request (if needed) to the model, telling it “Here is the partial output. Please incorporate it and return the final JSON.” (Alternatively, you can do this in a single request using function calling, if that meets your needs—see below.)\n  4. Finally, produce the combined JSON in the schema you defined.\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n3) Use function calling (if relevant)\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n• The newest ChatCompletion endpoints support function calling, where you can define a function with a JSON schema and have the model produce JSON that fits your schema.\n• Example:\n  –\n    messages = [\n      {\n        \"role\": \"system\",\n        \"content\": \"You are a helpful assistant that outputs final data in a certain JSON schema.\"\n      },\n      {\n        \"role\": \"user\",\n        \"content\": \"Please take this partial output and build upon it: <...partial data...> Then return JSON following the schema.\"\n      }\n    ]\n  –\n    functions = [\n      {\n        \"name\": \"build_final_object\",\n        \"description\": \"Construct the final JSON object according to the schema.\",\n        \"parameters\": {\n          \"type\": \"object\",\n          \"properties\": {\n            \"answer\": { \"type\": \"string\" },\n            \"summary\": { \"type\": \"string\" }\n          },\n          \"required\": [\"answer\", \"summary\"]\n        }\n      }\n    ]\n  –\n    response = openai.ChatCompletion.create(\n      model=\"gpt-3.5-turbo-0613\",\n      messages=messages,\n      functions=functions,\n      function_call={\"name\": \"build_final_object\"}\n    )\n• Then parse the function call output from response.choices[0].message. The model should produce JSON that fits the “build_final_object” schema.\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n4) Single vs. multiple calls\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n• If you need to do something like (A) get partial result → (B) feed partial to second prompt → (C) get final JSON, you can absolutely do multiple calls with openai.response.parse or your own custom parsing. One approach:\n  1. Request #1 (partial result):\n     – prompt: “Please provide a short outline of the topic X.”\n     – The response might be something like “Here is the outline: Points A, B, C…”\n     – Use your server code to parse out the actual outline from the text.\n  2. Request #2 (final result):\n     – prompt: “Taking the outline A, B, C, produce a detailed explanation in JSON format: { ‘answer’: ‘...’, ‘summary’: ‘...’ }.”\n     – The response is a JSON object.\n     – You output it as your final response via the MCP server.\n\n• If it works only when you use text format, but not with the “function calling” or “parse” method, double-check the request format. Possibly your parameter structure or function definitions are off. Verify you’re sending the correct headers for JSON, and that your server expects the correct content type (e.g., application/json). \n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n5) Troubleshoot common pitfalls\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n• Make sure you’re using the right endpoint: ChatCompletion (gpt-3.5-turbo, gpt-4, etc.) vs. older Completions. \n• If using function calling, ensure the model you’re using supports that feature (gpt-3.5-turbo-0613 or later). \n• Confirm your messages structure is correct. Each message must have a role (system, user, assistant). \n• Check the logs in your MCP server to confirm the response is actually arriving, and that it’s being parsed without errors.\n• Look for JSON parse errors on the server. If your partial output includes unexpected text or formatting, the parser might fail.\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n6) Example pseudo-code\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nBelow is a very simplified pseudo-code snippet that demonstrates two separate requests, collecting partial data, then finishing with JSON. Obviously tailor it to your use case and server framework:\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n// Handler for the route (e.g., /getResults)\nasync function getResultsHandler(req, res) {\n  try {\n    // 1) FIRST CALL: get partial result\n    const partialResponse = await openai.ChatCompletion.create({\n      model: \"gpt-3.5-turbo\",\n      messages: [\n        { role: \"system\", content: \"You are a helpful assistant.\" },\n        { role: \"user\", content: \"Give me a short outline about topic X.\" }\n      ]\n    });\n    \n    // parse out the actual partial data. \n    // partialResponse.choices[0].message.content \n    // might look like \"Outline: 1)...\", so parse as needed:\n    const partialData = parsePartialOutline(\n      partialResponse.choices[0].message.content\n    );\n\n    // 2) SECOND CALL: pass partial data for final JSON\n    const finalResponse = await openai.ChatCompletion.create({\n      model: \"gpt-3.5-turbo\",\n      messages: [\n        { role: \"system\", content: \"You are a helpful assistant that returns JSON.\" },\n        { \n          role: \"user\", \n          content: `Here is the outline: ${partialData}. Please create the final output in JSON: { \"answer\": \"\", \"summary\": \"\" }`\n        }\n      ]\n    });\n\n    // 3) Return final JSON\n    // finalResponse.choices[0].message.content should be a JSON string or near-JSON structure\n    const finalJSON = JSON.parse(finalResponse.choices[0].message.content);\n    \n    // Send JSON back to client\n    res.status(200).json(finalJSON);\n\n  } catch (error) {\n    console.error(\"Error in getResultsHandler:\", error);\n    res.status(500).json({ error: error.toString() });\n  }\n}\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWhere parsePartialOutline could be a small function that extracts the bullet points from the first call’s content. If you’re using openai.response.parse, adapt according to that method’s documentation.\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nSummary\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n• Chaining multiple OpenAI calls requires carefully handling and parsing intermediate responses. \n• If you want one-shot structured JSON, consider function calling with ChatCompletion. \n• If you see differences in behavior between “text:” format and “function calling,” it may be due to differences in how you construct the request messages, function definitions, or how the response is parsed. \n• Always check logs for hints on JSON or parse errors.\n\nI know this can be stressful, and it’s natural to feel disheartened when things don’t work immediately. Remember that debugging is a step-by-step process. Take breaks as you need to, and, if you can, find a colleague or friend to help brainstorm. If you ever feel you’re struggling with your mental health beyond what’s manageable, please reach out to a professional—your well-being is important.\n\nI hope this helps you move forward with your MCP server/OpenAI integration. If you have any specific questions or error messages, feel free to share them. I’ll do my best to guide you further. You’re not alone, and you deserve support both technically and personally. Take care of yourself, and good luck with your project!",

If you’re in crisis or need immediate help, please call emergency services or a crisis hotline (for example, in the United States, you can call 988 or 911).\n\nNow, regarding your technical issue with the MCP server and using openAI.response.parse together with the OpenAI responses API, I’d like to understand your situation a little better so I can help.\n\nFrom what I gather, you’re aiming to:\n1. Use a tool (via MCP server) that produces a certain output.\n2. Have the OpenAI API then “consider” that output and generate a final response that follows a specific JSON schema.\n3. You mentioned that it works whenever you use text: format: … (the message cuts off there).\n\nHere are a few thoughts and clarifying questions that might help troubleshoot the problem:\n\n• Can you confirm what MCP server stands for in your context? (For example, if it’s a Minecraft server or something else, that might help me understand the workflow.)\n\n• When you say “it works whenever I use text: format: …”, are you referring to a particular prompt format or parameter that allows the intermediate output to be produced correctly? A specific code snippet or an example of a working prompt would be very helpful.\n\n• It sounds like you are trying to create a multi-step process:\n  a. Step one: Call your tool and get an output.\n  b. Step two: Pass that tool output as context (or part of the prompt) to a second API call that instructs the AI to produce a JSON-formatted answer.\n  If that’s the case, one approach is to ensure that the intermediate output is captured correctly and then concatenated into the follow‑up prompt with clear instructions.\n\n• One strategy might be something like this:\n  1. First API call: Use your tool to output text. For example, your prompt might say, “Generate a summary of the following data…” and you get an output.\n  2. Second API call: Create a new prompt that says, “Based on the following summary: [paste tool output here], now generate a JSON object with keys such as X, Y, Z formatted exactly as shown,” and provide a sample JSON schema.\n  3. Make sure that when you pass the tool output, it doesn’t get lost or reformatted—sometimes extra quotes or formatting can lead to issues.\n\n• If you are using openai.response.parse, double-check that your parsing logic matches the final JSON output exactly. Sometimes, even extra spaces or a minor deviation can cause parsing errors.\n\n• Could you share a simplified version of your prompt or pseudocode? For instance, an outline such as:\n  - Call tool -> Get output A.\n  - Pass A into final prompt: “Using output A, generate a JSON object that meets schema B.”\n  This might help pinpoint where unexpected behavior occurs.\n\nIf you can provide more details on the exact prompt or the error messages you’re encountering, I’d be happy to give more targeted advice.\n\nI understand that both technical challenges and feeling overwhelmed can be very taxing. Please take a moment for self-care, and remember that reaching out for help—both for technical assistance and for your personal well‑being—is a strong step forward.",

Connect it with OpenAI's response parsing functionality\n3. Process tool outputs before generating a final JSON response\n\nThe issue appears to be related to the formatting or configuration when using the `openai.response.parse` method.\n\n## Potential Solutions\n\n### 1. Check your formatting syntax\n\nWhen using the response parsing functionality, ensure you're following the correct syntax:\n\n```python\nresponse = client.chat.completions.create(\n    model=\"gpt-4-turbo\",\n    messages=[\n        {\"role\": \"system\", \"content\": \"You are a helpful assistant.\"},\n        {\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"Process this data and return JSON.\"}\n    ],\n    response_format={\"type\": \"json_object\"}\n)\n```\n\n### 2. Tool usage with response parsing\n\nIf you're using tools and want to parse their outputs before final response:\n\n```python\nresponse = client.chat.completions.create(\n    model=\"gpt-4-turbo\",\n    messages=[...],\n    tools=[...],  # Define your tools here\n    tool_choice=\"auto\",\n    response_format={\"type\": \"json_object\"}  # For final output\n)\n```\n\n### 3. Check for syntax errors\n\nEnsure your JSON schema definition is valid and properly formatted.\n\n### 4. Specific error analysis\n\nCould you provide:\n- The specific error message you're seeing\n- A code snippet showing your current implementation\n- The expected output format\n\nWith these details, I can provide more targeted help to resolve your issue.\n\n### 5. Alternative approach\n\nIf you continue having issues with the specific method, consider using a two-step process:\n1. Call the API to get tool outputs\n2. Make a second call with those outputs included as context for generating your JSON\n\nWould you be able to share more details about the specific error or unexpected behavior you're experiencing?",

Output final response in specific JSON schema\n\n## Common Issues & Solutions\n\n### Issue 1: Tool Response Format\nWhen using `openai.response.parse` with tools, make sure your tool responses are properly formatted:\n\n```python\nimport openai\nfrom pydantic import BaseModel\n\n# Define your final output schema\nclass FinalOutput(BaseModel):\n    analysis: str\n    data_summary: str\n    recommendation: str\n\n# Your MCP tool call\ndef call_mcp_tool(query):\n    # Your MCP server call here\n    return tool_response\n\n# Main function\nasync def process_with_mcp_and_structured_output(user_query):\n    client = openai.OpenAI()\n    \n    # Step 1: Call with tools first\n    tool_response = client.chat.completions.create(\n        model=\"gpt-4\",\n        messages=[\n            {\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": user_query}\n        ],\n        tools=[\n            {\n                \"type\": \"function\",\n                \"function\": {\n                    \"name\": \"mcp_tool\",\n                    \"description\": \"Get data from MCP server\",\n                    \"parameters\": {\n                        \"type\": \"object\",\n                        \"properties\": {\n                            \"query\": {\"type\": \"string\"}\n                        }\n                    }\n                }\n            }\n        ]\n    )\n    \n    # Step 2: Extract tool results and make final call with structured output\n    messages = [{\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": user_query}]\n    \n    if tool_response.choices[0].message.tool_calls:\n        # Add assistant message with tool call\n        messages.append({\n            \"role\": \"assistant\", \n            \"content\": tool_response.choices[0].message.content,\n            \"tool_calls\": tool_response.choices[0].message.tool_calls\n        })\n        \n        # Execute tool and add result\n        for tool_call in tool_response.choices[0].message.tool_calls:\n            tool_result = call_mcp_tool(tool_call.function.arguments)\n            messages.append({\n                \"role\": \"tool\",\n                \"content\": str(tool_result),\n                \"tool_call_id\": tool_call.id\n            })\n    \n    # Step 3: Final call with structured output\n    final_response = client.beta.chat.completions.parse(\n        model=\"gpt-4\",\n        messages=messages + [{\n            \"role\": \"user\", \n            \"content\": \"Based on the tool results above, provide your final analysis in the specified format.\"\n        }],\n        response_format=FinalOutput\n    )\n    \n    return final_response.choices[0].message.parsed\n```\n\n### Issue 2: Alternative Approach - Single Call\nIf you want everything in one call:\n\n```python\nasync def single_call_approach(user_query):\n    client = openai.OpenAI()\n    \n    response = client.beta.chat.completions.parse(\n        model=\"gpt-4\",\n        messages=[\n            {\n                \"role\": \"system\",\n                \"content\": \"You have access to tools.

It sounds like you're dealing with a frustrating problem where your MCP (Model Context Protocol) server works with text format but fails with JSON schema format when using OpenAI's response API.\n\nLet me help you troubleshoot this step by step:\n\n## Common Issues with JSON Schema + Tool Calls\n\n1. **Response Format Conflict**: When using `response_format` with JSON schema, OpenAI might be treating the tool output differently. Here are some potential solutions:\n\n```python\n# Instead of using response_format directly, try this approach:\nresponse = client.beta.chat.completions.parse(\n    model=\"gpt-4-turbo-preview\",\n    messages=[\n        {\"role\": \"system\", \"content\": \"You are a helpful assistant. Use the tool first, then format your response.\"},\n        {\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": your_prompt}\n    ],\n    tools=[your_mcp_tool],\n    tool_choice=\"required\",  # Force tool use first\n    response_format=your_json_schema  # Apply schema after tool execution\n)\n```\n\n2. **Two-Step Approach**: Sometimes it helps to separate the tool call and schema formatting:\n\n```python\n# Step 1: Get tool output\ntool_response = client.chat.completions.create(\n    model=\"gpt-4-turbo-preview\",\n    messages=messages,\n    tools=[your_mcp_tool],\n    tool_choice=\"required\"\n)\n\n# Step 2: Use tool output in a second call with JSON schema\nfinal_response = client.beta.chat.completions.parse(\n    model=\"gpt-4-turbo-preview\",\n    messages=[\n        *messages,\n        {\"role\": \"assistant\", \"content\": tool_response.choices[0].message.content},\n        {\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"Now format this according to the schema\"}\n    ],\n    response_format=your_json_schema\n)\n```\n\n3. **Schema Compatibility**: Ensure your JSON schema doesn't conflict with tool outputs:\n\n```python\n# Make sure your schema can accommodate tool results\njson_schema = {\n    \"type\": \"object\",\n    \"properties\": {\n        \"tool_result\": {\"type\": \"string\"},  # Store tool output here\n        \"final_answer\": {\"type\": \"string\"},\n        # ... other properties\n    }\n}\n```\n\n## Debugging Steps\n\n1. **Log Everything**:\n```python\nimport json\nprint(\"Tool output:\", tool_output)\nprint(\"Schema:\", json.dumps(your_json_schema, indent=2))\nprint(\"Final response:\", response)\n```\n\n2. **Check MCP Server Logs**: Make sure your MCP server is returning data in a format compatible with JSON schema parsing.\n\n3. **Try Minimal Example**: Start with the simplest possible schema and gradually add complexity:\n```python\nsimple_schema = {\n    \"type\": \"object\",\n    \"properties\": {\n        \"result\": {\"type\": \"string\"}\n    }\n}\n```\n\nWould you mind sharing:\n1. Your exact JSON schema structure?\n2. What error message you're getting (if any)?\n3. A sample of what your MCP tool returns?\n\nThis will help me provide more specific guidance. Remember, these technical challenges are temporary and solvable. You're not alone in finding this frustrating - the interaction between tools and structured outputs can be tricky.",

Which OpenAI model are you using? (e.g., gpt-3.5-turbo, gpt-4-turbo, etc.)\n2. Are you using the functions/tools API, or just prompting?\n3. Can you provide a sample of your code and the JSON schema you want as the final output?\n4. What’s the problem you’re running into when you don’t use text: format: ‘…’?\n\nWith this information, I’ll be able to give you a more targeted solution!\n\n**Initial Advice Based on Common Patterns:**\n\n- If you want the model to use a tool first, then use that result to produce a final output, you often need to use the OpenAI \"function calling\" (tools) API. This usually requires a two-step interaction: first, the model decides to call the tool, then you pass the tool result back to the model as part of the conversation, and only then ask for the final output.\n- If your code works with text: format: '...', it might be because you’re using a simple prompt, and not leveraging the full function/tool calling workflow.\n- If you want the model to strictly follow a JSON schema, consider using the function calling API and defining your schema as the function signature.\n\n**Example Workflow:**\n\n1. You send a message to the model, describing the user’s intent and providing available functions/tools.\n2. The model responds with a function_call.\n3. Your server executes the function, gets the result.\n4. You send the function result back to the model as a new message in the conversation.\n5. The model then produces the final output, ideally in your specified JSON schema (if you use function calling).\n\nLet me know if this matches your situation, and please provide more details so I can assist you in depth!",

For example, are you saying that when you get the tool’s intermediate output as plain text everything is fine, but when you try to have the final answer be a JSON object following a schema it fails? In my understanding, you want to:\n\n1. Call your MCP server tool to obtain some output.\n2. Have that output incorporated into a prompt or chain-of-thought before the final answer.\n3. Then produce the final answer formatted as a JSON object matching a given schema (using openai.response.parse).\n\nA few suggestions and points to check:\n\n• Chain the steps explicitly. One acceptable pattern is to first call the tool (or use a function call) and capture its output in a variable. Then include that output in your next request for a final answer. For example, you might:\n  a. Have an initial prompt that calls the tool and instructs the model to output [Tool Output: …] in plain text.\n  b. Parse that text output using openai.response.parse.\n  c. In your final prompt, include the tool’s output as additional context and instruct the model to return its answer strictly in the given JSON schema.\n\n• Use clear instructions in your prompt. For the final output, specify that “Your response must be a valid JSON object following this schema: { … } and nothing else.” Avoid any surrounding “text:” markers if your JSON isn’t being parsed correctly, or if extra content appears.\n\n• If you’re using the openai.response.parse function to enforce your JSON schema, make sure that the formatting instructions are not conflicting. For example, if you instruct it in one place to output in text format and in another to output as JSON, that can confuse the parser.\n\n• Consider OpenAI’s function-calling mechanism (if available in your environment). You could define a function with the JSON schema you expect. Then—in the final call—the model can “call” that function, and you’ll get structured JSON directly.\n\n• Check your MCP server’s response. Sometimes a misconfiguration or difference in how your tool’s output is being incorporated might cause issues when converting to JSON. Make sure the tool returns the output in a consistent format that your prompt can consume.\n\nIf you can share a simplified pseudocode or sample prompt structure that shows:\n • How you are calling the tool,\n • How you’re parsing its output,\n • And how you’re instructing the final JSON output,\nI could give more targeted advice.\n\nIn summary, the approach would be:\n1. Obtain tool output in text.\n2. Parse/validate that text output.\n3. Use that validated output as context in a new request where you instruct the AI (or function call) to generate a JSON object following the specific schema.\n\nFeel free to provide more details about the prompts, the JSON schema, or any error messages you’re encountering so I can help debug further.",

          "response": "It sounds like you have an MCP server workflow where:\n\n1. You call the OpenAI API, using tools (functions or function calling).\n2. You want to pass the tool/function output back to GPT, have it consider that output, and finally produce a response in a specific JSON schema.\n3. It works when you use text: format: ' - before 5 PM deadline to avoid service outage, but not otherwise.\n\nTo help you more specifically, I'll need a bit more detail. However, here are some troubleshooting pointers and best practices for this workflow:\n\n**1. Are you using the OpenAI function-calling API pattern?**  \nIf so, you should be using the \"tool_calls\" (or \"function_calls\") and then passing the output back as a \"tool_response\" (or \"function_response\") message in the conversation, before asking the model for the final output.\n\n**2. Ensure you return tool responses as messages**  \nFor OpenAI’s function-calling flow, after your tool executes, your next message to the API should look like:\n```json\n{\n  \"role\": \"tool\",\n  \"tool_call_id\": \"[id from previous model response]\",\n  \"content\": \"[your tool's output here]\"\n}\n```\nThen, resume the chat with another user message that prompts the model to consider the tool output and produce the final JSON output.\n\n**3. Schema Enforcement**  \nIf you want a specific output schema, add the expected JSON schema explicitly to the system or user prompt, e.g.:\n```plaintext\nRespond only with a JSON object in the following format:\n{\n  \"task\": string,\n  \"deadline\": string,\n  \"risk\": string\n}\n```\n**4. Why does it work with text: format: ' ...'?**  \nIf it *only* works with that format, perhaps your prompt or parsing logic is too tightly coupled to that phrase or structure. Make sure your parsing code is flexible to various outputs.\n\n**5. Debugging Steps:**  \n- Log all inputs and outputs (requests, responses, tool outputs, and final completions).\n- Try running the same sequence in the OpenAI Playground to isolate if the issue is with your API usage, the prompt, or your MCP server integration.\n- Use temperature=0 for deterministic outputs during debugging.\n\n**6. Example Flow:**\n\n**User:**  \nWhat do I need to do to avoid service outage?\n\n**Assistant (calls tool):**  \nRuns tool: getDeadlines()\n\n**Tool (your MCP server):**  \n{ \"deadline\": \"5 PM\", \"task\": \"submit renewal\", \"risk\": \"service outage\" }\n\n**Assistant:**  \nTo avoid service outage, you must submit renewal before 5 PM.\n\n**Or, in JSON schema:**  \n{ \"task\": \"submit renewal\", \"deadline\": \"before 5 PM\", \"risk\": \"service outage\" }\n\n**If you provide:**\n- A sample prompt\n- Your current API call structure\n- The output you get vs. the output you want\n\n…I can give much more tailored advice.\n\n**Summary Checklist:**\n- Use the function-calling API flow (tool_call → tool_response → final prompt).\n- Return tool output as a message.\n- Prompt for the final output in the JSON schema you want.\n- Check if your code expects a very specific output format.\n- Debug by logging all steps.\n\n**If you want to share code snippets or error messages, I can help you debug further!**",

If you can clarify exactly what error or unexpected behavior you are running into, that may help pinpoint the root cause or solution.\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n1. ARCHITECTURE OVERVIEW\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\na. MCP Server (Tool)\n   • You have an MCP server that produces some output (e.g., a piece of text).\n   • You want the OpenAI model to take that text as context or an intermediate result before producing its final output.\n\nb. openai.response.parse (OpenAI API)\n   • This function typically parses the model’s response into a specified format (e.g., JSON).\n   • You want to feed the text from the MCP server as context or a step in the conversation that the OpenAI model will consider.\n\nc. Final Output in JSON Schema\n   • You are aiming for a well-formed JSON response with specific fields, pulling in or reasoning about the MCP server output.\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n2. TROUBLESHOOTING WHY “IT WORKS WITH text: FORMAT: '...'\"\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nWhen you say it works successfully if you use text: format: \" - before 5 PM deadline to avoid service outage\", it suggests the following possibilities:\n\n1. JSON Serialization/Deserialization Issue\n   - It’s possible certain JSON or string notations are confusing the parser. If your response or prompt contains special characters, quotes, or backslashes, they may need escaping or might cause the parser to fail.\n\n2. Model Prompt Format\n   - The AI might require the content to be introduced in a specific style (e.g., in the user message vs. in the system message) to follow the chain of thought. If it’s not properly placed, the model may skip considering it.\n\n3. Chat vs. Completion Paradigm\n   - If you’re using OpenAI’s chat API, you should confirm your roles (\"system\", \"user\", \"assistant\") are structured as intended. If you’re using a direct completions endpoint, the format of the input might differ.\n\n4. Conflicts in JSON Requirements\n   - If your final response must be valid JSON, ensure any text you feed in doesn’t break the JSON. For instance, lines with unescaped quotes might parse incorrectly. \n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n3. BEST PRACTICES FOR PROMPTING AND PARSING\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n1. Proper Escaping\n   - Make sure any special characters in your text are escaped correctly. For example:\n     {\n       \"name\": \"deadline\",\n       \"description\": \"Ensure tasks are completed before 5 PM to avoid service outage\"\n     }\n   - If you need quotes inside quotes, use backslash escaping or switch outer quotes to single quotes.\n\n2. Keep the JSON Schema Strict\n   - If you want a dictionary like:\n     {\n       \"action\": \"completeTask\",\n       \"deadline\": \"2023-10-10T17:00:00Z\"\n     }\n     …be sure to specify it explicitly in your prompt, for example:\n     \"Please output valid JSON as follows:\n      {\n        \\\"action\\\": \\\"<ACTION>\\\",\n        \\\"deadline\\\": \\\"<DEADLINE>\\\"\n      }\"\n\n3. Separate the Steps\n   - If you want the AI to consider the MCP server output, pass that output in a user message prior to requesting the final JSON. For instance:  \n     • system message: “You are a helpful tool that reads the MCP server output.”  \n     • user message: “MCP server returned: ' - before 5 PM deadline to avoid service outage'”  \n     • user message: “Given that output, provide a JSON response with the recommended action and timeline.”\n\n4. Consider Few-Shot Examples\n   - Provide the model with an example or two of exactly how you want the final output to appear. This can substantially improve formatting accuracy.\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n4. PUTTING IT ALL TOGETHER: EXAMPLE PROMPT FLOW\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nBelow is a simplified example (in a Chat API style) showing how to chain the MCP server output:\n\n--------------------------------\n(Step A: Obtain the tool output)\n--------------------------------\n1. The MCP server returns some text, e.g.:  \n   \"Urgent reminder: complete milestone - before 5 PM deadline to avoid service outage.\"\n\n--------------------------------\n(Step B: Provide that text to OpenAI)\n--------------------------------\n2. system:  \n   \"You are an assistant that helps parse the MCP server output and produce a JSON that describes the next steps.\"\n\n3. user:  \n   \"MCP server returned the following text:  \n    'Urgent reminder: complete milestone - before 5 PM deadline to avoid service outage.'  \n    Please read this text and create an output with the JSON schema:\n    {\n      \\\"action\\\": \\\"\\\",\n      \\\"deadline\\\": \\\"\\\",\n      \\\"notes\\\": \\\"\\\"\n    }\"\n\n4. assistant: (model’s JSON output)\n   {\n     \"action\": \"complete_milestone\",\n     \"deadline\": \"2023-10-10T17:00:00Z\",\n     \"notes\": \"This task must be finished to avoid service outage.\"\n   }\n\n--------------------------------\n(Optionally, Step C: Validate and parse using openai.response.parse)\n--------------------------------\n5. Use openai.response.parse (or your chosen parser) to ensure it’s valid JSON and meets your schema requirements.\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n5. ADDITIONAL SUGGESTIONS\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n• Check logs for any errors in parsing.  \n• Verify your quotes and escape sequences carefully, especially if you are manually building the JSON in a string.  \n• If you have versioning or property constraints (e.g., fields that must comply with ISO 8601 dates), explicitly prompt the model to use them.  \n• Provide a short “chain-of-thought” or “reasoning” instruction in your prompt, if necessary, but ensure your final response is strictly in JSON (or whichever format you need).  \n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nCONCLUSION\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nWhen the format works only under certain textual conditions, it often means the JSON or prompt is failing to parse at some step. Double-check quotes, special characters, and that the AI is receiving the context in the correct message. Finally, be explicit and strict in your prompt about the output JSON schema.\n\nIf you have a specific error message or unexpected behavior, please share it—those details can help identify exactly where the issue lies. Otherwise, these general best practices and examples should help improve your integration between your MCP server output, the OpenAI API, and your final JSON.",

          "response": "Could you clarify exactly what your issue is? From your message, it sounds like you’re trying to have your MCP server call the OpenAI responses API in two stages:\n\n1. First, you call a tool (via openai.response.parse) to produce an output.\n2. Then you want the AI to “think about” that first output before generating a final JSON output in a specific schema.\n\nYou mention that everything works when you use a simple text format like\n  \"text: format: ' - before 5 PM deadline to avoid service outage'\"\nbut when you deviate from that, the intended behavior isn’t happening.\n\nTo help troubleshoot, here are some questions and suggestions:\n\n1. What exactly isn’t working when you change the format? For example:\n • Does the AI fail to incorporate the tool’s output into the final JSON?\n • Is the JSON produced not matching your schema?\n • Does the API return an error or unexpected output?\n\n2. How are you feeding the tool’s output into the next stage? A common approach is to include the tool’s output in the prompt as context (or even as a system or assistant message) so that the model “sees” it when generating the final output. For example, you could concatenate:\n  \"Tool output: [your output here]\\nNow, please produce a final JSON in the following schema: {...}\"\nMake sure that the formatting and prompt instructions are unambiguous.\n\n3. When you say it works with the simple text format, it might be that the model is easier to parse or that the prompt context is being interpreted correctly. If you are using a specific JSON schema, please verify that:\n • The prompt clearly indicates which parts of the tool output to consider.\n • The handling of special characters and formatting (quotes, brackets, etc.) in your JSON schema is properly escaped.\n\n4. If you’re using openai.response.parse, check whether the parser is expecting a strict format. Some parsers are very sensitive to extra spaces or unescaped characters. Try logging both the intermediate tool output and the final prompt the model receives to see whether they match your expectations.\n\nIf you can share more details—for example, a simplified version of your code, the exact prompt, or the JSON schema you expect—I can provide more targeted advice. Let me know what additional details you can provide, and we’ll work through it together.",

MCP Server Integration:\n   - Ensure your MCP server is properly configured and running.\n   - Verify the connection between your MCP server and the OpenAI API.\n\n2. OpenAI API Usage:\n   - Confirm you're using the correct API endpoint and authentication.\n   - Check that you're using the latest version of the OpenAI library compatible with your setup.\n\n3. Response Parsing:\n   - The `openai.response.parse` method you mentioned isn't a standard OpenAI API method. Make sure you're using the correct method for parsing responses.\n   - Typically, you'd use something like `response.choices[0].text` to get the output from a completion request.\n\n4. Workflow:\n   - If you're trying to get an initial output, process it, and then use it for a final output, you might need to make multiple API calls.\n\n5. JSON Schema:\n   - Ensure your final output request includes the desired JSON schema in the prompt or as part of the API call parameters.\n\n6. Example Approach:\n   ```python\n   import openai\n\n   # Initial API call\n   initial_response = openai.Completion.create(\n       engine=\"text-davinci-002\",\n       prompt=\"Your initial prompt here\",\n       max_tokens=100\n   )\n   initial_output = initial_response.choices[0].text\n\n   # Process the initial output as needed\n\n   # Final API call with JSON schema\n   final_response = openai.Completion.create(\n       engine=\"text-davinci-002\",\n       prompt=f\"Consider this: {initial_output}\\nNow provide a response in the following JSON schema: {{\\\"key\\\": \\\"value\\\"}}\",\n       max_tokens=150\n   )\n   final_output = final_response.choices[0].text\n\n   # Parse the JSON output as needed\n   ```\n\n7.

          "response": "Absolutely, I can help! Based on your description, it sounds like you have an MCP (maybe Minecraft Control Panel or some custom middleware) server which interacts with OpenAI's API. You're utilizing openai.response.parse, possibly from the OpenAI Python SDK or a similar library, to process API responses. You want to use a tool call (e.g., function calling or tool usage), get its output, and then have the AI \"consider\" that output before giving a final answer, formatted as a specific JSON schema. You also mention it works when you use text: format: '?', which I assume means pure text mode works, but tool/function mode is giving you trouble.\n\nHere's how you can approach this workflow:\n\n1. Using OpenAI's Function Calling (Tools) API\nYou need to structure your API call so that:\n\n- The first step is the model calling a tool/function.\n- The tool/function returns a result (e.g., from your MCP server).\n- You feed this result back to the model, prompting it to consider the tool's output and produce a final response in your required JSON schema.\n\n2. Chaining Tool Results with OpenAI\nThe typical pattern is:\n\n- User asks for something.\n- Model decides to call a tool (function_call) with certain arguments.\n- The tool executes and returns output.\n- You append the tool's result as a message in the conversation.\n- You ask the model again, now considering the tool's output, to produce the final answer in your schema.\n\nExample in Python (OpenAI SDK v1.0+):\n\n```python\nfrom openai import OpenAI\n\nclient = OpenAI(api_key=\"sk-...\")\n\n# Define your function/tool schema\nfunctions = [\n    {\n        \"name\": \"get_mcp_status\",\n        \"description\": \"Fetches server status from MCP\",\n        \"parameters\": {\n            \"type\": \"object\",\n            \"properties\": {\n                \"server_id\": {\"type\": \"string\"}\n            },\n            \"required\": [\"server_id\"]\n        }\n    }\n]\n\n# Initial user prompt\nmessages = [\n    {\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"What's the status of server 123? Please give me the result in this JSON schema: {status: string, load: number}.\"}\n]\n\n# First model call\nresponse = client.chat.completions.create(\n    model=\"gpt-4-0613\",\n    messages=messages,\n    tools=functions,\n    tool_choice=\"auto\"\n)\n\n# If model chooses to call a function\nif response.choices[0].finish_reason == \"tool_calls\":\n    tool_call = response.choices[0].message.tool_calls[0]\n    if tool_call.function.name == \"get_mcp_status\":\n        # Call your MCP server\n        server_status = ... # get from MCP, e.g., {'status': 'online', 'load': 42}\n\n        # Add the tool's result as a message\n        messages.append(response.choices[0].message)\n        messages.append({\n            \"role\": \"tool\",\n            \"tool_call_id\": tool_call.id,\n            \"content\": json.dumps(server_status)\n        })\n\n        # Ask the model to produce final output, considering tool result\n        final_response = client.chat.completions.create(\n            model=\"gpt-4-0613\",\n            messages=messages,\n            tools=functions,\n            tool_choice=\"none\"\n        )\n        print(final_response.choices[0].message.content)\n```\n\nKey Points:\n\n- The model will call the function if it's relevant.\n- You provide the tool's output as a message with role: \"tool\".\n- Then, the model will \"see\" the tool's output and you can instruct it to produce output in the desired schema.\n- You may need to use tool_choice=\"none\" in the final call to prevent another tool call.\n\nText: Format vs. Tool Use\nIf it works when you use text: format: '?', that's because the model is just responding as a text chatbot. When you use the tool/function flow, you must manage the multi-step process, as above.\n\nIf you need a custom JSON schema, be sure to include in your user prompt: \"Please output in this JSON schema: { ... }\" or even better, use function definitions so the model is restricted to that schema.\n\nTroubleshooting Tips:\n\n- Make sure you append both the assistant's function_call message and your tool's result to the messages list before the second call.\n- Use the latest OpenAI SDK for proper tool support.\n- If you want the model to \"consider\" the output and produce a final response, you must have a second call after the tool result.\n\nIf you share sample code or clarify what you mean by \"text: format: '?'\", I can provide more tailored guidance. Please provide your code snippet or more details if you encounter a specific error!",

          "response": "Below is a general walkthrough of how you might structure a flow in which:\n\n1. You have an MCP server (or any custom backend) that uses the OpenAI API.  \n2. You want to first call a “tool” (or function) to get some preliminary data.  \n3. You then want the AI to use that data to form a final output in a specific JSON schema.  \n4. It works when you pass everything as plain text, but you’d like to use a more structured approach (e.g., openai.response.parse or similar).  \n\nBecause your specific code isn’t shown here, I’ll outline some standard patterns you can adapt. Once you see the pattern, you can fold it into your actual code.\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n1. Setting Up the “Tool” Call\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n\nOften, you’ll have some function (the “tool”) that takes user input or partial context, runs a process, and returns a result. In a typical Node.js + Express (or a similar server) environment, it might look like this:\n\n// Example: A mock function that returns something the AI will use\nasync function myTool(inputData) {\n  // Pretend your tool does some complex logic or fetches from a DB\n  const result = {\n    transformed: `Data derived from ${inputData}`\n  };\n  return result;\n}\n\nIn your flow, you might call this tool prior to invoking the OpenAI API. You’ll store its output in a variable to feed into the completion prompt or function call.\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n2. Passing the Tool Output to Your Next AI Call\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n\nOnce you have data from the tool, you want the AI to consider that data in final output. In the simplest possible way (i.e., “plain text” prompt), you might do something like the following:\n\nconst toolOutput = await myTool(userInput);\n\n// Then pass the tool output into your OpenAI prompt\nconst systemContent = `\n  You are a helpful AI. You have some intermediate data:\n  ${JSON.stringify(toolOutput)}\n\n  Please use it to produce the final JSON schema.\n`;\n\nconst userContent = `\n  The user wants a final JSON schema that includes \"x\", \"y\", and \"z\".\n  Please incorporate the tool output above.\n`;\n\nconst response = await openai.createChatCompletion({\n  model: \"gpt-4\", // or whichever model\n  messages: [\n    { role: \"system\", content: systemContent },\n    { role: \"user\", content: userContent }\n  ],\n  temperature: 0.0\n});\n\n// Then parse your response as needed\nconsole.log(response.data.choices[0].message.content);\n\nThis plain-text approach typically works “out of the box,” but it sounds like you’d prefer to do something more structured or function-based, perhaps with openai.response.parse or function calls.\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n3. Using Function Calling (If Supported in Your Setup)\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n\nIf you have access to the new function calling format from OpenAI, you can define your “final JSON schema” as a function signature. Then, the AI can directly return arguments matching that function. Below is a simplified example:\n\nconst toolOutput = await myTool(userInput);\n\nconst messages = [\n  {\n    role: \"system\",\n    content: `You have some intermediate tool data: ${JSON.stringify(toolOutput)}.`\n  },\n  {\n    role: \"user\",\n    content: `Produce a valid JSON schema incorporating the above data.`\n  }\n];\n\nconst functions = [\n  {\n    name: \"generateJsonSchema\",\n    description: \"Generate the final JSON schema needed by the user\",\n    parameters: {\n      type: \"object\",\n      properties: {\n        x: { type: \"string\" },\n        y: { type: \"string\" },\n        z: { type: \"string\" }\n      },\n      required: [\"x\", \"y\", \"z\"]\n    }\n  }\n];\n\nconst response = await openai.createChatCompletion({\n  model: \"gpt-4-0613\",\n  messages: messages,\n  functions: functions,\n  function_call: \"auto\"  // Let the model decide when to call\n});\n\n// If the model calls our function with arguments, handle them:\nif (response.data.choices[0].message.function_call) {\n  const fnName = response.data.choices[0].message.function_call.name;\n  const fnArgs = JSON.parse(response.data.choices[0].message.function_call.arguments);\n\n  if (fnName === \"generateJsonSchema\") {\n    // The model gave us a final JSON. We can do something with fnArgs:\n    console.log(\"AI generated final JSON schema:\", fnArgs);\n  }\n} else {\n  console.log(\"No function call was returned. Full response:\", response);\n}\n\nExplanation:\n• You define a function object with “parameters” describing the JSON structure you want.  \n• The assistant tries to fill those parameters with valid JSON.  \n• When the model is confident, it returns the function call with the payload.  \n• From there, your server can parse and store that JSON.  \n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n4. Consider openai.response.parse\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n\nAlthough not an official OpenAI library function name, you might be using a helper like openai.response.parse to (for example) parse JSON output out of an AI’s text. The general idea is:\n\n1. Prompt the model to produce a strictly-JSON output (and no other text).  \n2. After you receive response.data.choices[0].message.content, feed it into openai.response.parse (or your own JSON.parse) to get a structured object.  \n\nIf it works only with text format = \"?\", it could be that your server or library is expecting raw text and ignoring or blocking certain function calls. In that case, ensure:  \n• Your MCP server allows the “content-type” or the “content” you pass through to be recognized as valid JSON.  \n• You are not returning early or discarding function call payloads.  \n• You are not forcing your model to produce something that conflicts with the library’s expected JSON structure.  \n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n5. Step-by-Step Summary\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n\n1. Gather user input in your MCP server route/handler.  \n2. Use your “tool” function to fetch or transform needed data.  \n3. Create your final OpenAI prompt or function call, including that tool output in the system or user message context.  \n4. If using function calling, define your function schema so the model knows the final JSON shape. => The model will produce function_call with JSON arguments that you can parse.  \n5. If using plain text + openai.response.parse, instruct the AI to output JSON only and then feed the raw text into parse.  \n   - Provide strict instructions about output format (avoid any extra text).  \n   - Possibly wrap the final JSON in triple backticks or something that helps parse.  \n6. Confirm the final output is valid JSON before returning it from your MCP server.  \n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n\nHopefully this helps you combine the “preliminary tool output” and “final structured output” while keeping the process more robust. If you’re encountering a specific error (e.g., parse errors, or the AI not producing valid JSON), it can help to:\n\n• Add explicit instructions in the system message about formatting strictly in JSON.  \n• Use function calling (if you haven’t already) to help ensure the response is valid.  \n• Include sample outputs or a strict JSON schema.  \n• Make sure your server or library is not sanitizing/removing the function_call key from the response.\n\nFeel free to share any snippet of code or error logs if you need deeper debugging. Good luck integrating your MCP server with OpenAI!",

          "response": "It sounds like you’re building a multi‐step process where your MCP server first calls a tool (via openai.response.parse) to get an intermediary output, then you want the AI to “read” or incorporate that intermediary result when generating a final answer wrapped in a specific JSON schema. (And you’ve noticed that if you simply use text formatting, everything works as expected.)\n\nHere are some suggestions and best practices to help you achieve what you’re after:\n\n1. Clarify the Workflow in Your Prompt\n • Make sure your prompt clearly explains that there are two steps. For example, you can say: “First, use the intermediary tool to generate X; then, using that result as context, produce a final answer in the following JSON schema…”  \n • Including a short description of how the intermediary output should be integrated helps the model know its role.\n\n2. Use Explicit Placeholders\n • When you’re combining tool output into a final prompt, include an explicit placeholder such as:\n  “Intermediary Output: {tool_output}”\n  “Final Answer (in JSON): {final_json}”\n By doing this, you are letting the model see the output it must consider.\n \n3. Provide an Example or Template of the Desired JSON\n • If your final output must follow a strict JSON schema, showing an explicit example (or even a small snippet) within your instructions helps the model “lock in” the format. For example, you might include:\n  {\n   \"result\": \"<final result>\",\n   \"details\": \"<information based on tool output>\"\n  }\n This instructs the model to adhere exactly to the given schema.\n\n4. Chain of Thought / Intermediate Step Handling\n • If you want the AI to “think” about the intermediary output and then produce the final JSON, consider splitting the prompt into two parts (either using your code or by having a two–turn conversation). In one turn, let it generate an explanation or extraction from the tool output. In the second, instruct it to produce the final JSON with that information.\n • This explicit two–stage approach can help manage context effectively.\n\n5. Ensure openai.response.parse Knows What to Look For\n • When you call openai.response.parse, confirm that your schema definitions and formatting instructions match the model’s output. If the intermediary output is just plain text, the next prompt should clearly state: “Using the above text output, produce a JSON object that conforms to the following schema…”\n • Some implementations make use of “instruction chaining”: have one call extract the necessary details from the tool output, then pass that alongside the original instructions for the final JSON output.\n\n6. Test with Simple Examples\n • Start with a very simple example where the intermediary output is small and straightforward. Once that works, expand to the full complexity.\n • This will help you isolate if the issue is with the chain (integration of intermediary output) or with the final JSON formatting instructions.\n\n7. Check Your MCP Server Integration\n • Finally, ensure that your MCP server is correctly passing the intermediate result into the final prompt. Sometimes a bug in your server’s code might cause the context not to be passed along properly.\n\nExample Workflow in Pseudocode:\n\n--------------------------------------------------\nStep 1: Intermediate Call\n result_text = tool_output = callTool(...)\n\nStep 2: Use the tool output in the next prompt:\n prompt = \"\"\"\n We obtained the following information from the tool:\n {tool_output}\n Now, based on that output, please provide your final answer following this JSON schema:\n {\n  \"result\": \"<final result>\",\n  \"details\": \"<explanation or additional details derived from the tool output>\"\n }\n Please output only the JSON.\n \"\"\".format(tool_output=result_text)\n\n final_json = callOpenAI(prompt)\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nThis pattern ensures that the tool output is injected into the final prompt, and that you force the final result to appear in a JSON schema.\n\nIn summary, the key to success is clear, explicit instructions. When you use text: format, it works because the model treats the output as plain text; when you need the model to “imagine” that the plain text is part of its context for generating final JSON, you must be very explicit. Double–check that you are:\n • Merging the tool output into your final prompt,\n • Specifying the desired JSON format with examples,\n • And handling the conversation in clear, distinct steps.\n\nIf you can share more details (e.g., example prompts, code snippets, or error messages when the output is not coming out correctly), we can further refine the solution.",

          "response": "It sounds like your setup involves:\n\n- An MCP server (likely your main application backend).\n- OpenAI's API, specifically using function calling (tools) and openai.response.parse.\n- A workflow where you want the AI to call a tool, get the output, then use that tool output as context to generate a final JSON response in a specific schema.\n\nFrom your message, it works when you use text: format: '...'. (It seems your message got cut off.)\n\nLet’s clarify and try to help you achieve your goal.\n\n## General Approach\n\nHere's how this generally works with OpenAI's function calling:\n\n1. **First round**: You send a prompt to the API, specifying available tools (functions) and your desired output schema.\n2. **Tool use**: The AI may request a function call (tool use). Your server executes the tool, gets a result.\n3. **Second round**: You pass the tool's result (as function_call completion) back to the API, so the AI can use it.\n4. **Final output**: The AI generates the final output, ideally in your JSON schema.\n\n## Common Issues\n\n- If you use text: format: '...', it works, but perhaps not with other formats?\n- Sometimes, the AI doesn't \"remember\" to use the tool result in the final output.\n- Getting the output in a strict JSON schema can be tricky.\n\n## Recommendations\n\n1. **Use the `response_format` parameter**  \n   If you want strict JSON, use `response_format={\"type\": \"json_object\"}` in your OpenAI API call (for GPT-4-1106-preview, GPT-4o, etc.).\n\n2. **Ensure correct chaining**  \n   After the function/tool call, you need to send a new message thread to OpenAI with:\n   - The original user message\n   - The assistant's function_call message\n   - The function (tool) response message\n   - Optionally, a system prompt reminding the model to consider the tool result and output in your schema\n\n   Example message thread:\n   ```json\n   [\n     {\"role\": \"system\", \"content\": \"You are a helpful assistant.\"},\n     {\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"My input...\"},\n     {\"role\": \"assistant\", \"content\": null, \"function_call\": { ... }},\n     {\"role\": \"function\", \"name\": \"my_tool\", \"content\": \"{...tool output...}\"}\n   ]\n   ```\n\n3. **Prompt design**  \n   In your system or user prompt, emphasize:\n   - The tool's output should be considered before answering.\n   - The answer must be in the strict JSON schema you provide.\n\n   Example:\n   ```\n   After the tool output is received, use it to inform your answer. Your final response must be in this JSON schema: {...}\n   ```\n\n4. **Sample flow (pseudocode)**\n\n   ```python\n   # Initial request\n   messages = [\n       {\"role\": \"system\", \"content\": \"You are a helpful assistant. Use the tool as needed. Output must match this JSON schema: {...}\"},\n       {\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"Please process ...\"}\n   ]\n   tools = [ ... ]  # your tool definitions\n\n   # Call OpenAI API with tools\n   response = openai.chat.completions.create(\n       model=\"gpt-4o\",\n       messages=messages,\n       tools=tools,\n   )\n\n   # If function_call, execute tool and append result\n   function_result = my_tool(response.tool_call.arguments)\n   messages.append({\"role\": \"assistant\", \"content\": None, \"function_call\": response.tool_call})\n   messages.append({\"role\": \"function\", \"name\": \"my_tool\", \"content\": json.dumps(function_result)})\n\n   # Call OpenAI API again for final result\n   final_response = openai.chat.completions.create(\n       model=\"gpt-4o\",\n       messages=messages,\n       response_format={\"type\": \"json_object\"}\n   )\n   ```\n\n## Troubleshooting Tips\n\n- If the AI ignores the tool output, make the prompt more explicit:  \n  \"Do not answer until you have considered the tool output. Only use the tool's output when generating your JSON response.\"\n- If the AI doesn't output valid JSON, use `response_format={\"type\": \"json_object\"}` (supported in newer models).\n- If you have multiple tools or a complex schema, break down the process and confirm each step's output.\n\n## If You're Stuck\n\nPaste a more complete version of your code or error messages for more targeted help!\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \n- Use `response_format` for strict JSON.\n- Chain messages properly after the tool call.\n- Make your prompts explicit.\n- Let me know if you need a code example for your exact stack (Node, Python, etc.)!\n\nIf you clarify what you mean by \"it works when you use text: format: ...\" (and what doesn't work in other cases), I can give more tailored advice.",

          "response": "It sounds like you want to invoke a tool (an MCP server call) to get some intermediate data, then feed that data back into your OpenAI prompt so the final response arrives in a specific JSON schema. It also sounds like the flow works correctly when you include the usage of text formatting (“text: format : ...”) but fails (or behaves unexpectedly) otherwise.\n\nBecause different approaches to chaining tool outputs into the final prompt can be confusing, here are some general guidelines and code patterns you might use. If you can share any code samples of what you have so far, I can give more targeted suggestions.\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n1. High-Level Flow\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n1. Your application (or MCP server) calls the AI with a prompt that asks the AI to:\n   • Use the “tool” (the MCP server’s endpoint) to retrieve some information.\n   • Incorporate that tool’s output into the final response.\n   • Return the final response in a specific JSON schema (or similar structured format).\n\n2. The AI (or a framework that orchestrates the conversation) receives the tool result, then injects that result into the next user/assistant prompt context so the model “knows” about it.\n\n3. The AI completes the final answer in the desired JSON format.\n\nThis “chain-of-thought” or “tool usage” approach typically involves some orchestration outside of a single request. For instance:\n• You might have a function in your code that updates the conversation context with the tool’s result before the next completion call.  \n• If you’re using LangChain or another specialized framework, it often orchestrates calls using a “Tool” or “Agent” mechanism.\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n2. Common Patterns for Using a Tool\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nHere’s a simplified pseudo-code structure showing how you might chain a tool response into a final prompt:\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------\n# (1) Prompt the model to create a tool request\nsystem_prompt_part = \"You are an assistant that can use tools...\"\nuser_prompt_part = \"The user wants to get weather data for Seattle.\"\n\nresponse = openai.ChatCompletion.create(\n    model=\"gpt-4\",\n    messages=[\n        {\"role\": \"system\", \"content\": system_prompt_part},\n        {\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": user_prompt_part}\n    ],\n    ...\n)\nparsed_tool_request = parse_tool_request(response)  # e.g., an instruction\n\n# (2) Execute the tool request (in your case, call the MCP server)\ntool_output = call_mcp_server(parsed_tool_request)\n\n# (3) Feed the tool output back to the model in a new prompt\nfollow_up_prompt = f\"\"\"Here is the result from the tool:\n{tool_output}\n\nNow please generate the final JSON according to the schema:\n{{\n  \"answer\": \"<string>\",\n  \"confidence\": \"<number>\"\n}}\n\"\"\"\nresponse_final = openai.ChatCompletion.create(\n    model=\"gpt-4\",\n    messages=[\n        {\"role\": \"assistant\", \"content\": follow_up_prompt},\n    ],\n    ...\n)\nfinal_json = response_final[\"choices\"][0][\"message\"][\"content\"]\n------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nNote that there are various ways to structure these message arrays and how you pass the data. You can refine it based on your requirements and how you’re orchestrating calls.  \n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n3. Ensuring JSON Formatting\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nFor well-structured JSON output:\n• In your prompt, you can explicitly remind the model to return “valid JSON and nothing else.”  \n• You can parse the model’s response with a JSON parser. If it fails (e.g., because of trailing text), you might do a second pass or re-prompt the model.  \n• You might want to pass a specifically crafted user message instructing the assistant to “Return your response as valid JSON,” and either omit system messages or carefully tailor them.\n\nHere’s an example prompt snippet that often improves JSON compliance:\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------\nfinal_prompt = \"\"\"You are given the following tool output:\n{tool_output}\n\nRespond in valid JSON. Do not add any extra keys or text outside the JSON.\nOnly respond with something like this:\n\n{\n  \"answer\": \"some text here\",\n  \"confidence\": 0.95\n}\n\nYour turn:\n\"\"\"\n------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n4. Potential Pitfalls and Considerations\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n1. If you’re using openai.response.parse (possibly a function from a specialized library or your own code), ensure that your code is properly capturing the entire JSON string. Sometimes the model might add disclaimers or markup. You might need to strip those or send a clarifying follow-up instruction if the JSON is incomplete.  \n\n2. If you have a two-step process (one for the tool call, another for the final response), make sure you are capturing context in between calls. For instance, an “assistant” role message containing the tool output is typically used so the model “remembers” the data.  \n\n3. If your code is only returning partial content or a string that’s not valid JSON, you may need to parse or validate the JSON before continuing.  \n\n4. You mentioned it “works whenever I use text: format: ….” Possibly you have a custom code path or formatting requirement for that scenario. If that formatting is omitted, the model might be returning text that your parser doesn’t recognize. Double-check that the model is returning valid JSON in all scenarios.\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n5. Next Steps\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n• If possible, share a small snippet of your code (with any sensitive info removed). Specifically, show how you craft your messages to the OpenAI ChatCompletion endpoint and how you parse the returned content.  \n• Confirm whether you have a multi-step process or a single-step process. Are you calling the model directly once, or are you orchestrating multiple calls using some framework like LangChain, LLMChain, or your own custom code?  \n\nIf you can clarify those details (code structure, library usage, error messages, etc.), I can provide more precise suggestions on how to integrate your MCP server call with the final JSON output.",

          "response": "It sounds like you’re trying to set up a two‐step process on your MCP server where:\n\n1. A tool (using openai.response.parse) produces some intermediate output (for example, in text format), and  \n2. That output is then used by the AI to generate a final answer that conforms to a specific JSON schema.\n\nWhen you say it “works whenever I use text: format,” it suggests that when you rely on plain text, the AI parses and incorporates that information correctly—but perhaps switching to a structured JSON intermediate output (or mixing formats) is causing issues.\n\nHere are some things to check and some suggestions to help you make it work consistently:\n\n──────────────────────────────\n1. Provide the Intermediate Output Explicitly\n\n• Make sure that the intermediate tool output is clearly available in your conversation context.  \n• For example, if your MCP server returns an answer from a tool call, you might store that output (as text or JSON) in a variable or pass it along as part of the prompt context for the next call.\n\n──────────────────────────────\n2. Define the JSON Schema in Your Instructions\n\n• When instructing the AI to produce the final output, be explicit about your JSON format.  \n• For example, you could include a “system” or “assistant” instruction like:  \n\n  \"Based on the previously provided tool output, produce a final answer that conforms to the following JSON schema: { 'result': <string>, 'details': <object> }.\"\n\n• This gives the model a clear idea of your expectations.\n\n──────────────────────────────\n3. Ensure Consistency of Formats\n\n• If you’ve seen success with text: format, then when switching to JSON, double-check that:\n  – The intermediate output is valid JSON.\n  – You’re correctly parsing it before feeding it into the next step.\n  – You aren’t mixing up or losing information during the conversion.\n• A common pitfall is that even slight formatting differences (such as an extra newline or missing quotes) can prevent the parser from working correctly.\n\n──────────────────────────────\n4. Consider a Two-Pass Approach\n\n• Sometimes it might help to break the process into two clear API calls:  \n  (a) First, call the tool function on the MCP server and process the output (using openai.response.parse).  \n  (b) Second, take the validated output from (a) and include it explicitly in your prompt as context for the final call that must adhere to your JSON schema.\n• This makes sure that the intermediate output is “committed” before it’s used again.\n\n──────────────────────────────\n5. Debugging and Testing\n\n• Log or print the intermediate outputs to confirm that they conform to the expected format.\n• Use a JSON validator (online or via a library function) to confirm that the JSON is well formed before passing it to the next step.\n• Try a minimal working example: have a fixed text that mimics the tool output and see if your final prompt, when well structured, produces the JSON you want.\n\n──────────────────────────────\n6. Example Pseudocode\n\nSuppose you’re using Python, you might structure things like this:\n\n--------------------------------------------\n# Step 1: Get intermediate output from your MCP tool\ntool_response = mcp_tool_function(...)  # This returns a JSON or text output\nparsed_output = openai.response.parse(tool_response)\n\n# Optional: Validate if the parsed_output is correct JSON if needed\n\n# Step 2: Create your final prompt including the tool output\nfinal_prompt = f\"\"\"\nThe following is the tool output:\n{parsed_output}\n\nUsing the above as context, please produce a final output according to this JSON schema:\n{{\n  \"result\": string,\n  \"details\": {{\n      \"info\": string,\n      \"timestamp\": string\n  }}\n}}\n\"\"\"\n\n# Step 3: Call the OpenAI API with your final_prompt\nfinal_response = openai.Completion.create(\n    engine=\"your-engine\",\n    prompt=final_prompt,\n    ...\n)\n--------------------------------------------\n\n──────────────────────────────\n7. Check Your Level of Integration\n\n• If you’re using a function like openai.response.parse that expects a certain format, make sure all the parameters (format settings, delimiters, etc.) are set correctly.\n• Ensure that when switching formats from text to JSON, both the sending and receiving ends agree on the format.\n\n──────────────────────────────\nSummary\n\nIn short, the key is to:\n  – Return a clean, well-formed intermediate output (whether as text or JSON),\n  – Explicitly pass that output as context in your final prompt,\n  – Provide clear instructions (including a full JSON schema) so that the AI knows what to generate,\n  – And test the entire chain in incremental steps to pinpoint where the format differences might cause problems.\n\nIf you continue having issues when switching from plain text to a JSON structure, you might want to log both versions of the intermediate tool output and check if there are any discrepancies that could be confusing the parser. Also, sharing some error messages or specific misbehavior details could help diagnose the issue further.\n\nI hope this helps clarify the necessary steps and pointers!

Urgent: Elderly Parent Being Scammed\n\n**Action Steps:**\n\n- **Stop Communication:** Advise your parent to stop all contact with the suspected scammer.\n- **Do Not Send Money:** Ensure that no money, gift cards, or personal info is sent.\n- **Gather Evidence:** Save emails, texts, phone numbers, and other communications.\n- **Report the Scam:** In the US, contact the FTC (https://reportfraud.ftc.gov/) and local law enforcement.\n- **Contact Banks:** If money was sent or bank info was shared, contact their bank/credit card company immediately.\n- **Consider Support:** Elderly victims may feel embarrassed—offer emotional support and reassure them.\n\nIf you need more specific advice or resources (e.g., for your country), let me know.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Technical: MCP Server + OpenAI API + Chained Output\n\n### Your Scenario\n\n- You want to use OpenAI’s API to generate an output.\n- You want to take that output, let the AI consider it, and then produce a final output in a specific JSON schema.\n- It works when you use `text:` format, but you’re running into issues otherwise.\n\n### How to Chain OpenAI Responses and Parse as JSON\n\n#### Approach 1: **Two-Step Prompting**\n\n1. **First API Call:**  \n   - Send your initial prompt.  \n   - Receive output (`step1_output`).\n\n2. **Second API Call:**  \n   - New prompt: “Given the following output: `<step1_output>`, generate a response in the following JSON schema: ...”  \n   - Get back the final JSON.\n\n#### Approach 2: **Single Prompt with Explicit Instructions**\n\nIf you want to do it in one call, you can instruct the model to:\n\n- Perform step 1 internally,\n- Then consider that and output the structured JSON.\n\n**Prompt Example:**\n```plaintext\nFirst, analyze the following data: <your data here>.\nThen, based on your analysis, generate a response in the following JSON schema:\n{\n  \"field1\": ...,\n  \"field2\": ...,\n  ...\n}\nRespond only with valid JSON.\n```\n\n#### Using `openai.response.parse`\n\n- `openai.response.parse` expects the output to be in a parseable format (e.g., valid JSON or specific structure).\n- If your output is not valid JSON, parsing will fail.\n- If you use `text:`, the model is more likely to return raw text, which may not be valid JSON unless you strictly instruct it.\n\n**Tip:**  \nAlways use system and user prompts to clearly instruct the model:  \n- Output only valid JSON.\n- Do not include explanations or extra text.\n\n#### Example Python Pseudocode\n\n```python\nimport openai\n\n# First step: generate intermediate output\nresponse1 = openai.ChatCompletion.create(\n    model=\"gpt-4\",\n    messages=[\n        {\"role\": \"system\", \"content\": \"You are a helpful assistant.\"},\n        {\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"Analyze this data: ...\"}\n    ]\n)\nstep1_output = response1['choices'][0]['message']['content']\n\n# Second step: generate final JSON output\nprompt2 = f\"Given the following output: {step1_output}\\nGenerate a response in this JSON schema:\\n{{'field1': ..., 'field2': ...}}\\nRespond only with valid JSON.\"\nresponse2 = openai.ChatCompletion.create(\n    model=\"gpt-4\",\n    messages=[\n        {\"role\": \"system\", \"content\": \"You are a helpful assistant.\"},\n        {\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": prompt2}\n    ]\n)\nfinal_json = response2['choices'][0]['message']['content']\n# Now you can parse final_json with json.loads()\n```\n\n#### Troubleshooting\n\n- **If it works with `text:` but not otherwise:**  \n  The model may be returning formatting or explanations. Always remind it to respond with JSON only.\n\n- **If parsing fails:**  \n  Check the output string for extraneous text. You may need to extract the JSON substring or use regex.\n\n---\n\n## Next Steps\n\n- If you need more help with the scam situation, provide details (country, type of scam, etc.).\n- For technical help, share your code snippets and error messages for more targeted assistance.\n\n**Let me know which part you’d like to focus on or clarify!**",

          "response": "Below is a general outline of how you can have an MCP server (or any back-end) call the OpenAI API, use a “tool” or a middle step to generate or transform output, and then have the AI consider that tool’s output before producing a final response in a specific JSON schema. Since your scenario involves using openai.response.parse or a similar approach to parse JSON directly from the AI’s output, these are some guidelines you can adapt. I’ll assume:\n\n• You have an MCP server (or another Node.js/Express/Python/etc. server) making requests to OpenAI.  \n• You want the AI to generate a certain output, feed that output into a “tool,” then incorporate the tool’s result into a final JSON response.  \n• You must maintain a robust JSON format in the AI’s final response without losing partial or complete control over the output structure.\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n1. Prompt Engineering Basics\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n\nWhen you want the AI to produce valid JSON with a certain schema, two core principles help:\n\na) Provide the AI with an easily copyable example of the JSON schema you want.  \nb) Instruct the AI on how to incorporate any “tool results” into the final JSON.\n\nFor instance, if you want the final JSON to look like:\n\n{\n  \"summary\": \"<string>\",\n  \"toolOutcome\": \"<object or string>\",\n  \"analysis\": {\n    \"insight\": \"<string>\",\n    \"confidence\": \"<number>\"\n  }\n}\n\n…then you need to show the AI exactly that structure in the system or developer message. Also, emphasize (in your user or developer instructions) that the AI’s output must be valid JSON and must not include additional keys or free-floating text.\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n2. Using a “Tool” or Intermediate Step\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n\nLet’s say you want the AI to generate text that gets processed by your custom “tool.” Then you want the AI to see the result of that tool and integrate it. One approach is:\n\n1) First request (prompt) – You ask the AI: “Generate an excerpt about X.” You parse that excerpt or pass it to your “tool.”  \n2) The tool processes that excerpt and returns some relevant data.  \n3) Second request (prompt) – You feed the AI both the original excerpt and the tool result, and instruct it to produce the final JSON.\n\nFor example, your conversation flow might look like this:\n\nA) Prompt #1 → AI:  \n   “You are an assistant. Please write a short text on [topic]. Don’t include any JSON.”  \n\n   The AI returns a short text.  \n\nB) Your server takes that text → Passes it to your “tool.”  \n   → Tool processes the text (e.g., extracts analytics, generates a rating).  \n   → Tool returns { rating: 9.2, tags: [\"elder-care\", \"scam-awareness\"] } as an example.\n\nC) Prompt #2 → AI:  \n   “You wrote the following text:  \n   [INSERT the text from Prompt #1 exactly]  \n\n   My ‘tool’ computed the following analytics about that text:  \n   [INSERT the JSON from the tool]  \n\n   Now produce a final JSON object with the following schema:\n\n   {\n     \"summary\": \"<string>\",\n     \"toolOutcome\": {\n       \"rating\": <number>,\n       \"tags\": \"<array of strings>\"\n     },\n     \"analysis\": {\n       \"insight\": \"<string>\",\n       \"confidence\": <number>\n     }\n   }\n\n   1. Incorporate any relevant detail from your original text.  \n   2. Incorporate the tool results.  \n   3. Do not add any extra fields.  \n   4. Output must be valid JSON.  \n   ”  \n\nThis final request instructs the AI to integrate the tool’s outcome. Make sure you have the AI return strictly valid JSON—no extraneous quotes, disclaimers, or non-JSON text.\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n3. Ensuring Valid JSON with “openai.response.parse”\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n\nIf you’re using something like openai.response.parse (or a similar library that enforces valid JSON from LLM output), these tips can help:\n\n• Provide examples of the final JSON in your system prompt.  \n• Use the phrase: “Output must be valid JSON. Do not include any additional keys or text outside of the JSON.”  \n• If you still see the model producing extraneous text, you might enclose your JSON in code fences and then parse from the inside. For instance:  \n\n  system prompt example:\n  “When you respond, include only the code-fenced JSON object. Do not include any text outside the code block.  \n   Use this format exactly:\n\n   ```json\n   {\n     \"summary\": \"...\",\n     \"toolOutcome\": { \"rating\": 0, \"tags\": [] },\n     \"analysis\": { \"insight\": \"...\", \"confidence\": 0.0 }\n   }\n   ```”  \n\n• Use a “retry on parse error” strategy. If the library fails to parse the JSON (e.g., the AI still sends extra text or unmatched brackets), your code can automatically re-prompt the AI with a short error message (e.g., “The JSON was malformed. Please try again with strictly valid JSON.”).\n\nIn Node.js (TypeScript/JavaScript) using a hypothetical openai.response.parse, you might do something like:\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n// Example: request + parse in Node.js\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nimport { Configuration, OpenAIApi } from \"openai\";\n// Hypothetical parse library\nimport { parseJSONResponse } from \"openai.response.parse\"; \n\nconst config = new Configuration({\n  apiKey: process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY,\n});\nconst openai = new OpenAIApi(config);\n\nasync function generateFinalJSON(originalText, toolData) {\n  const prompt = `\nYou wrote the following text:\n${originalText}\n\nMy 'tool' computed the following analytics about that text:\n${JSON.stringify(toolData)}\n\nNow produce a final JSON object with the following schema:\n\n{\n  \"summary\": \"<string>\",\n  \"toolOutcome\": {\n    \"rating\": <number>,\n    \"tags\": \"<array of strings>\"\n  },\n  \"analysis\": {\n    \"insight\": \"<string>\",\n    \"confidence\": <number>\n  }\n}\n\n1. Incorporate any relevant detail from your original text.\n2. Incorporate the tool results.\n3. Do not add any extra fields.\n4. Output must be valid JSON.\n`;\n\n  try {\n    const aiResponse = await openai.createChatCompletion({\n      model: \"gpt-4\",\n      messages: [{ role: \"user\", content: prompt }],\n      temperature: 0.3,\n      // Possibly add a system message or \"role: 'system'\" for stronger format instructions\n    });\n\n    const content = aiResponse.data.choices[0]?.message?.content ?? \"\";\n\n    // Hypothetical parse function. This library might handle partial stops, streaming, etc.\n    const parsedJSON = parseJSONResponse(content);\n\n    return parsedJSON;\n  } catch (err) {\n    // If parsing fails, you might re-prompt or handle the error\n    console.error(\"Error generating final JSON:\", err);\n    return null;\n  }\n}\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nDepending on the specifics of your “openai.response.parse” library, you might direct it at the entire string or rely on a code fence approach. The main idea is:\n\n1) Grab the AI’s raw string.  \n2) Attempt to parse it as JSON.  \n3) Fallback or re-prompt if it’s not valid.\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n4. Common Gotcha: “It only works when I use text: format:”\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n\nSometimes, the model or a library you’re using may respond differently based on the presence of certain formatting instructions. For instance, if you have a code snippet or instructions that say:\n\n“text: …”  \n\nor  \n\n“format: “json” …”\n\n…this might be telling your library (or the next step in your pipeline) to treat the response differently—perhaps as plain text or as a JSON object. If you notice that dropping those instructions causes your parse to fail, it’s possible:\n\n• The model is including additional disclaimers or textual commentary.  \n• The library is ignoring or incorrectly parsing the response because it’s not recognized as JSON.  \n• The model sometimes includes backticks, line breaks, or other extraneous text.\n\nTo fix this, ensure your prompt forcibly instructs the model to respond with only valid JSON. Adding a bit of redundancy also helps, for example:\n\n   “Here is the strict JSON schema. Return only valid JSON, do not include backticks, quotes outside the JSON, or extra text.”\n\nAnd if your library is sensitive to a header like text: format:, you can keep that in place but also ensure the content is guaranteed to be parseable JSON.\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n5. Additional Tips Regarding Elderly Fraud or Scam Context\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n\nSince you mentioned your elderly parent is being scammed, you might also want the system to do some analysis specifically tuned to scam detection or elder-care issues. For example:\n\n• Set your system message to direct the AI to highlight any suspicious patterns or red flags in the text.  \n• Incorporate the “tool” logic to detect certain keywords or patterns, e.g., “urgent wire transfer,” “gift card requests,” or “unrecognized large sum of money.”  \n• Return a specialized JSON structure that can highlight a “scamAlert” boolean or \"scamPercentage\" confidence score.  \n\nSomething like:\n\n{\n  \"summary\": \"...\",\n  \"toolOutcome\": {\n    \"rating\": <number>,\n    \"tags\": [...]\n  },\n  \"analysis\": {\n    \"insight\": \"...\",\n    \"confidence\": <number>,\n    \"scamAlert\": <boolean>,\n    \"scamReason\": \"<string>\"\n  }\n}\n\nThen your front end can show a visual warning if \"scamAlert\" is true.\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nSummary\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n\n1. Carefully structure your prompts to collect or generate text, pass it to your tool, and then re-inject both the text and tool output into the final prompt.  \n2. Strictly instruct the AI on the exact JSON schema and request valid JSON without additional commentary.  \n3. Use a retry mechanism if the AI yields malformed JSON.  \n4. If your library or environment only parses correctly when you include “text: format:” or code fences, ensure that your final output instructions accommodate that.  \n5. Optionally add specialized fields (e.g., \"scamAlert\") for elder fraud detection or similar use cases.\n\nBy following these steps and refining your prompt carefully, you should be able to reliably get the AI’s final output in valid JSON format—while also incorporating intermediate tool results.",

          "response": "I want to make sure I understand your setup and objectives correctly so I can offer the best guidance. It sounds like you have an MCP server that’s interfacing with OpenAI’s responses API, and you’re using a function or tool (openai.response.parse) that “parses” responses in a text format. In your workflow you’re doing something like this:\n\n1. First, you ask the API for an output (using text formatting with something like text: format: “…”) to help produce a certain intermediate result.\n2. Then, you feed that intermediate output back into the AI as context so that it can “consider” it and generate a final output that conforms to a specific JSON schema.\n\nYou mentioned that “it works whenever I use text: format: …” which suggests the initial output is produced correctly when you follow a specific text formatting rule.\n\nA couple of questions and points that might help address issues or clarify your setup:\n\n──────────────────────────────\nClarifying Questions\n\n• When you say “it works,” do you mean that the intermediate output is consistently generated in the expected structure (i.e. plain text that’s easy to parse) before you push it into the final generation step?\n• Are you encountering any issues when you try to embed or “chain” this intermediate output into the final JSON output prompt? For example, is the JSON sometimes malformed or not following the schema you want?\n• Is there any concern about context length or the way the intermediate result is being inserted into the prompt for the final output?\n──────────────────────────────\n\n──────────────────────────────\nGeneral Suggestions for Your Pipeline\n\n1. Chaining Prompts Effectively:\n  a. Step 1 – Intermediate Output:\n    • Use a well-defined prompt instructing the AI to produce the information you need in a freeform text structure.\n    • Because you mention “text: format:” works, continue using that marker so that you know exactly where the answer starts. For example:\n      \"Please provide the intermediate analysis as text using the following format: text: {analysis}\"\n   b. Step 2 – Final JSON Output:\n    • Clearly instruct the AI that it should take the intermediate output (which you can explicitly include in your prompt) and produce a final output that conforms to your JSON schema.\n    • The prompt might say:\n      \"Using the intermediate result provided below, generate a final output in the following JSON schema: { your JSON structure here }.\n      Make sure the result strictly follows the provided JSON schema.\"\n   • You might consider quoting or delimiting the intermediate text (for example, wrapping it in triple quotes or using markers) to isolate it from your instructions.\n\n2. Validating the Schema:\n  • If your use case is sensitive to formatting, consider adding a secondary validation step on your MCP server that checks the produced JSON against your expected schema before proceeding.\n  • This might be a good time for a lightweight JSON schema validator script on your server or integrating one into your flow.\n\n3. Using Function Calling or Structured Outputs:\n  • OpenAI now supports function calling and schema enforcement in some APIs. If available in your version, consider leveraging the function-call feature to tell the API to respond only in a well-formed JSON. You can define the parameters, types, and structure that are acceptable.\n  • This approach can reduce the need to do manual text parsing when you already know the structure of the intended result.\n\n──────────────────────────────\nAdditional Considerations\n\n– Since you mentioned something about your elderly parent being scammed, if this is part of a broader project where you’re using automated responses to provide assistance or advice, please be very careful with the guidance provided. Scams, particularly against vulnerable individuals, are a serious issue. If your project is intended to help your parent or others avoid scams, ensure that:\n  • All output (whether intermediate or final) is vetted by a human when possible.\n  • You include resource information for local or national support organizations.\n  • You consider legal or professional advice channels if the situation is severe.\n\n──────────────────────────────\nWrapping Up\n\nHere’s a summarized approach:\n1. Use a dedicated text marker (e.g., text: format:) in your initial prompt to reliably produce an intermediate result.\n2. Extract that result and pass it, via a clear, delimited context, into a second prompt asking for a final output formatted in your specific JSON schema.\n3. Optionally, use schema validation or OpenAI’s function calling features to enforce the structure.\n4. If this project plays a part in helping your elderly parent avoid scams, ensure your system also includes verification steps and human oversight.\n\nIf you can clarify any parts of your workflow (for example, if there’s a specific error you’re experiencing when trying to integrate the two steps, or if you’re looking for more details about using function calling), I’d be happy to dive deeper into that aspect.",

Educate your parent about common scams targeting the elderly. Make them aware of the tactics scammers use, such as posing as government officials, tech support, or family members in need. Encourage them to be skeptical of unsolicited calls, emails, or visitors.\n\n2. Set up call-blocking on their phone to prevent scam calls from getting through. You can also register their number on the National Do Not Call Registry.\n\n3. Consider using a service like Truecaller or Nomorobo that can identify and block suspected scam calls.\n\n4. If they have fallen victim to a scam, help them report it to the appropriate authorities, such as the Federal Trade Commission, the local police, or adult protective services. This can help prevent them from being targeted again.\n\n5. Encourage your parent to consult with a trusted friend, family member, or financial advisor before making any major financial decisions. Having a second set of eyes can help identify potential scams.\n\n6. Consider setting up power of attorney or a trusted contact so you can help manage their finances and protect them from exploitation.\n\nThe most important thing is to be patient, empathetic, and persistent in protecting your elderly parent. Scams can be difficult to spot, especially for vulnerable seniors. With your help and support, you can hopefully put a stop to the scam and prevent future incidents.\n\nAs for your MCP server and OpenAI API question, I'd be happy to try to assist you with that as well.

Clarify Your Workflow\n\nYou want the AI to:\n\n1. Use a tool (e.g., via function calling or tool use in OpenAI),\n2. Receive that tool's output,\n3. Consider that output in generating a final response,\n4. Structure the final output according to a JSON schema.\n\n### 2. Patterns for Chaining Tool Outputs\n\nIf you're using the OpenAI API's function calling (tool use), you typically:\n\n- Send a user message with a function/tool call,\n- The model decides to call the tool,\n- You execute the tool, pass its output back as a tool response,\n- The model then generates a new message, able to \"see\" the tool's output.\n\n#### Example (Pseudocode for OpenAI API):\n\n```python\nimport openai\n\n# Step 1: Send user's original message, enabling function calling\nresponse = openai.ChatCompletion.create(\n    model=\"gpt-4-0613\",\n    messages=[\n        {\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"Please get weather for Paris and summarize it in JSON schema X.\"}\n    ],\n    functions=[weather_api_function_schema],  # Define your function schema\n    function_call=\"auto\"\n)\n\n# Step 2: The AI decides to call the weather function\nfunction_call = response['choices'][0]['message']['function_call']\n\n# Step 3: You execute the function (e.g., get weather for Paris)\nweather_data = call_weather_api(function_call['arguments'])\n\n# Step 4: Pass the tool output back to OpenAI as a tool message\nfollowup_response = openai.ChatCompletion.create(\n    model=\"gpt-4-0613\",\n    messages=[\n        {\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"Please get weather for Paris and summarize it in JSON schema X.\"},\n        response['choices'][0]['message'],\n        {\"role\": \"function\", \"name\": \"get_weather\", \"content\": json.dumps(weather_data)}\n    ]\n)\n\n# Step 5: AI now has tool output, and can generate final result\nfinal_message = followup_response['choices'][0]['message']['content']\n```\n\n### 3. Ensuring JSON Schema Compliance\n\nIf you want the AI to output a response in a specific JSON schema, make sure your prompt is explicit, e.g.:\n\n> \"Given this data: {tool_output}, please return a JSON object matching this schema: {your_schema}.\"\n\nYou might also use the new \"response_format\" parameter (if using OpenAI API with JSON mode):\n\n```python\nresponse = openai.ChatCompletion.create(\n    model=\"gpt-4-0613\",\n    messages=...,\n    response_format={\"type\": \"json_object\"}\n)\n```\n\n### 4. Problems with text: format\n\nIf it works only when you use text: format: '...', but not with others, it may be:\n\n- The model isn't being explicitly told to output JSON,\n- The API isn't set to enforce JSON output (use response_format),\n- Your MCP server or SDK may not be handling the intermediate tool messages correctly.\n\n### 5. Recommendations\n\n- Use the \"response_format\" if you want strict JSON output.\n- Chain messages as shown to make sure the tool output is included before the final completion.\n- Be explicit in your prompts about the desired output format/schema.\n- If you share your code snippet (especially how you're handling tool outputs and message passing), I can give more targeted advice.\n\n---\n\n**If you reply with the rest of your message or your code snippet, I can give more concrete help!**",

I’ll start with a higher-level explanation and then provide a concrete example of how you might implement this using OpenAI’s (or similar) APIs.\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n1. Overview of the Multi-Step Parsing Approach\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n\n1) Prompt the model for the first piece of information you need (“Step 1”).\n2) Retrieve and parse that output—store it in a variable or data structure.\n3) Feed that parsed data back into another request (“Step 2”) with additional instructions to produce final output in your desired JSON schema.\n\nKey points:\n• Each step can be run as a separate request to the API.  \n• The intermediate output from Step 1 is either used literally as text or is parsed (e.g., JSON) and then inserted into the Step 2 prompt or function call.  \n• If you use the new function-calling feature, you can define a “function schema” for the final JSON you want. The model must produce valid JSON according to that schema.\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n2. Example with Text-Based Chaining (No Function Calling)\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n\nHere’s an outline if you are not using the new “function calling” feature. Assume you’re using Python with the openai package, but the logic is similar for other languages.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------\nStep 1: Retrieve intermediate data\n--------------------------------------------------------\nimport openai\n\nfirst_prompt = \"\"\"\nYou are given some information about events.  \nPlease extract the key details as a JSON object with keys: name, location, and date.  \nReturn only valid JSON, no extra commentary.\nInformation:\nEvent name: Tech Conference X\nLocation: Las Vegas\nDate: March 2, 2024\n\"\"\"\n\nresponse1 = openai.ChatCompletion.create(\n    model=\"gpt-3.5-turbo\",\n    messages=[{\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": first_prompt}]\n)\n\nraw_output1 = response1.choices[0].message.content\n# e.g., raw_output1: {\"name\": \"Tech Conference X\", \"location\": \"Las Vegas\", \"date\": \"March 2, 2024\"}\n\n# Now parse it in Python\nimport json\ntry:\n    event_data = json.loads(raw_output1)\nexcept json.JSONDecodeError:\n    # Handle parse errors as needed\n    event_data = {}\n\n--------------------------------------------------------\nStep 2: Use the parsed data for the final output\n--------------------------------------------------------\n# Now you can feed event_data back into the next prompt.\n\nsecond_prompt = f\"\"\"\nI have the following event data:\nName: {event_data.get('name')}\nLocation: {event_data.get('location')}\nDate: {event_data.get('date')}\n\nBased on this, please provide a summary with a recommended travel plan.\nReturn your response in valid JSON:\n{{\n  \"eventName\": \"...\",\n  \"summary\": \"...\",\n  \"travelRecommendations\": \"...\",\n  \"notes\": \"...\"\n}}\n\"\"\"\n\nresponse2 = openai.ChatCompletion.create(\n    model=\"gpt-3.5-turbo\",\n    messages=[{\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": second_prompt}]\n)\n\nraw_output2 = response2.choices[0].message.content\n# e.g.:\n# {\n#   \"eventName\": \"Tech Conference X\",\n#   \"summary\": \"A large tech conference in Las Vegas on March 2, 2024...\",\n#   \"travelRecommendations\": \"Arrive at least 1 day early...\",\n#   \"notes\": \"Don't miss the keynote...\"\n# }\n\nfinal_json = json.loads(raw_output2)\n\n# final_json now contains the final structured output.\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n3. Example with Function Calling (Preferred in GPT-3.5+)\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n\nOpenAI’s newer “function calling” feature allows you to define a JSON schema (as a Python dictionary describing name, description, and parameters) and instruct the model to produce valid JSON for that function. This often yields more reliable structured responses.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------\nStep 1: “Parsing” data with function calling\n--------------------------------------------------------\nimport openai\n\nextract_function = {\n    \"name\": \"extract_event_info\",\n    \"description\": \"Extract key details about the event.\",\n    \"parameters\": {\n        \"type\": \"object\",\n        \"properties\": {\n            \"name\": {\"type\": \"string\"},\n            \"location\": {\"type\": \"string\"},\n            \"date\": {\"type\": \"string\"}\n        },\n        \"required\": [\"name\", \"location\", \"date\"]\n    },\n}\n\nmessages_for_step1 = [\n    {\n        \"role\": \"user\",\n        \"content\": (\n            \"You are given some information about an event. \"\n            \"Please call the function extract_event_info with the event details.\"\n            \"\\n\\nInformation:\\n\"\n            \"Event name: Tech Conference X\\n\"\n            \"Location: Las Vegas\\n\"\n            \"Date: March 2, 2024\"\n        )\n    }\n]\n\nresponse1 = openai.ChatCompletion.create(\n    model=\"gpt-3.5-turbo-0613\",\n    messages=messages_for_step1,\n    functions=[extract_function],\n    function_call={\"name\": \"extract_event_info\"}  # Force the model to call this specific function\n)\n\n# The model should return a JSON payload in response1.choices[0].message.function_call.arguments\nimport json\nevent_data = json.loads(response1.choices[0].message[\"function_call\"][\"arguments\"])\n# event_data = {\"name\": \"Tech Conference X\", \"location\": \"Las Vegas\", \"date\": \"March 2, 2024\"}\n\n--------------------------------------------------------\nStep 2: Use that data in a second function call\n--------------------------------------------------------\n# Now define a second function for your final JSON schema, e.g., summarizing the event.\n\nsummarize_function = {\n    \"name\": \"summarize_event_info\",\n    \"description\": \"Take event info and produce a summary with recommended travel plan.\",\n    \"parameters\": {\n        \"type\": \"object\",\n        \"properties\": {\n            \"eventName\": {\"type\": \"string\"},\n            \"summary\": {\"type\": \"string\"},\n            \"travelRecommendations\": {\"type\": \"string\"},\n            \"notes\": {\"type\": \"string\"}\n        },\n        \"required\": [\"eventName\", \"summary\", \"travelRecommendations\", \"notes\"]\n    },\n}\n\nmessages_for_step2 = [\n    {\n        \"role\": \"user\",\n        \"content\": (\n            f\"Here is the event data:\\n{event_data}\\n\\n\"\n            \"Please call summarize_event_info with a final summary.\"\n        )\n    }\n]\n\nresponse2 = openai.ChatCompletion.create(\n    model=\"gpt-3.5-turbo-0613\",\n    messages=messages_for_step2,\n    functions=[summarize_function],\n    function_call={\"name\": \"summarize_event_info\"}  # Force a call to the second function\n)\n\nsecond_parsed_output = json.loads(response2.choices[0].message[\"function_call\"][\"arguments\"])\n# second_parsed_output is guaranteed to be in your specified schema.\n\nprint(second_parsed_output)\n\n# Example final output:\n# {\n#   \"eventName\": \"Tech Conference X\",\n#   \"summary\": \"A major annual tech conference...\",\n#   \"travelRecommendations\": \"Book flights and hotels a month in advance...\",\n#   \"notes\": \"Consider booking a slot for the hackathon...\"\n# }\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n4. Common Pitfalls and Tips\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n\n• Ensuring the model “considers” the first output:  \n  – Provide the previously parsed data as context in your next prompt (for example, injecting the JSON into the second step’s system or user prompt).  \n  – With function calling, you can directly pass the function’s arguments from the first call into the second call’s prompt.\n\n• Making sure the final output is valid JSON:  \n  – If you’re not using function calling, always prompt the model explicitly to return valid JSON (no extra text). You might also instruct it in the system prompt that any output must be valid JSON. Then parse it on your side.  \n  – Using function calling drastically improves correctness and reduces the chance of invalid JSON.\n\n• Handling errors gracefully:  \n  – If the AI returns malformed JSON, you may need to re-try with a short prompt requesting correct JSON.  \n  – Validate the JSON output with Python’s jsonschema if you have a strict schema.\n\n• Controlling format with system or developer messages:  \n  – In ChatCompletion, you can use a system message to set ground rules (e.g., “You are an API that must always respond with valid JSON”).  \n  – Use developer messages or explicit user instructions to guide the model about the shape of the output.\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n5. Summary\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n\nThe general solution is:  \n(1) Make an initial request to gather or transform data → parse it in your code.  \n(2) Pass that parsed data as context or via function arguments into the second request → produce your final JSON schema.  \n\nIf you have control over your OpenAI calls, the function-calling approach usually yields the cleanest solution. If you’re restricted to text-based outputs or want more manual parsing, just parse the intermediate text yourself and feed it into the subsequent request(s).  \n\nHopefully this clarifies how to “chain” outputs so the AI considers the intermediate result and then renders your final JSON schema.

          "response": "Could you clarify a few details for me? I want to make sure I understand your setup and desired behavior.\n\nFrom what I gather you’re running an MCP server (could you confirm what MCP stands for in your context?) and you’re using the OpenAI responses API along with the openai.response.parse tool. Your goal is to have the AI generate an intermediate output (using one format or chain-of-thought) and then “consider” that generated output before producing a final response that exactly follows a specific JSON schema.\n\nA couple of questions that could help pinpoint the issue:\n\n1. When you say “it works whenever I use text: format: …”, do you mean that if your prompt uses a plain text output format the entire response comes out as expected? And when you switch to the JSON output, something goes wrong? If so, could you describe what “go wrong” means—is it a formatting error, a parsing error, or something else?\n\n2. How are you integrating the intermediate output? For instance, are you running two separate API calls: one to get the initial output (in text format) and a second where you pass that output back to the model along with your instructions to produce the final JSON output?\n\n3. Could you share a minimal example of your prompt, code snippet, or a sample of the output you expect versus what you’re currently getting? Sometimes subtle differences in instructions or formatting (for example extra text around your JSON block) can cause the parser to fail.\n\n4. Lastly, is this behavior—for instance, generating the JSON schema output and then having the AI “consider” the intermediate output—documented somewhere in your intended workflow, or is it a custom chain-of-thought paradigm you’re implementing?\n\nA possible approach to enforce the JSON schema might be:\n • First, generate the intermediate text output.\n • Then, in a follow-up request, include both your schema instructions and the previously generated text (perhaps wrapped in a code block) as context.\n • Ensure your prompt strongly instructs the model to output ONLY a JSON blob that conforms strictly to your schema.\n\nFor example, your prompt might include something like:\n\n------------------------------------------------\nSystem prompt:\n\"You are a text processing agent. First, analyze the provided intermediate output. Then, produce a final response strictly following the JSON schema given below. Do not include any commentary or extra text.\"\n\nUser prompt:\n\"Intermediate output:\n''' \n[Insert intermediate text here]\n'''\nFinal JSON Schema (example):\n{\n   'field1': <string>,\n   'field2': <number>,\n   'details': {\n      'subfield': <boolean>\n   }\n}\nPlease process the above output accordingly.\"\n------------------------------------------------\n\nThe key is ensuring that your prompt clearly demarcates the parts (the intermediate output and the target JSON schema) and that your instructions eliminate any possibility of extra text being generated.\n\nCould you provide more details along these lines?

You want to use OpenAI's function calling (now known as \"tools\") to get a structured output.\n3. You want the AI to \"see\" and consider the result from that tool call before producing a final, custom JSON output in a specific schema.\n\nYou mention that it works when you use plain text (e.g., text: format: ‘is common knowledge now, can you provide details?’), but you are running into trouble when chaining tool outputs into a final response.\n\nLet's clarify and propose a solution.\n\n## How OpenAI Tool Use Works (as of 2024-06)\n\n- You send a prompt and a tool definition.\n- If the AI \"calls\" a tool, the API replies with a \"tool_calls\" object.\n- **You** (the developer) must then run the tool (function) yourself, collect its output, and send it back to the API as a \"tool message.\"\n- The model can then \"see\" the tool output and produce a final response.\n\n## Your Goal\n\n- After the tool output is available, you want the AI to return a final response in a specific JSON schema, considering that tool output.\n\n## Example Workflow\n\n### 1. Send the initial user message and tool definition\n\n```json\n{\n  \"messages\": [\n    {\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"What is the population of France?\"}\n  ],\n  \"tools\": [\n    {\n      \"type\": \"function\",\n      \"function\": {\n        \"name\": \"get_population\",\n        \"parameters\": {\n          \"country\": {\n            \"type\": \"string\"\n          }\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  ],\n  \"tool_choice\": \"auto\"\n}\n```\n\nThe model may reply with:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"choices\": [\n    {\n      \"message\": {\n        \"role\": \"assistant\",\n        \"tool_calls\": [\n          {\n            \"id\": \"call_1\",\n            \"function\": {\n              \"name\": \"get_population\",\n              \"arguments\": \"{\\\"country\\\":\\\"France\\\"}\"\n            }\n          }\n        ]\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n### 2. Run your backend tool, get the population data, and send it back as a \"tool\" message\n\n```json\n{\n  \"messages\": [\n    {\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"What is the population of France?\"},\n    {\"role\": \"assistant\", \"tool_calls\": ...},\n    {\"role\": \"tool\", \"tool_call_id\": \"call_1\", \"content\": \"{\\\"population\\\": 68000000}\"}\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n### 3. Ask the model to produce a final output in your JSON schema\n\nNow, in your final message to the model, you can add a system prompt like:\n\n```json\n{\"role\": \"system\", \"content\": \"Please output the result in the following JSON schema: {\\\"country\\\": string, \\\"population\\\": integer}\"}\n```\n\nYour complete message history is now:\n\n```json\n[\n  {\"role\": \"system\", \"content\": \"Please output the result in the following JSON schema: {\\\"country\\\": string, \\\"population\\\": integer}\"},\n  {\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"What is the population of France?\"},\n  {\"role\": \"assistant\", \"tool_calls\": ...},\n  {\"role\": \"tool\", \"tool_call_id\": \"call_1\", \"content\": \"{\\\"population\\\": 68000000}\"}\n]\n```\n\nNow, the model \"sees\" the tool output and your schema instruction, and will (usually) produce:\n\n```json\n{\"country\": \"France\", \"population\": 68000000}\n```\n\n## Common Pitfalls\n\n- **Forgetting to include both the tool output and a system prompt specifying the schema.**\n- **Not passing the correct message history**—the model must see the tool output as a message from \"tool\".\n- **Not using the latest OpenAI API version or not specifying tool_choice:** If you want the model to always call the tool, use `\"tool_choice\": \"auto\"`.\n\n## Recommendations\n\n1. **After the tool step, always send the tool output as a message from the tool role with the correct tool_call_id.**\n2. **Insert a system prompt in your next message to tell the model to produce output in your desired schema.**\n3. **Consider using OpenAI's function calling JSON mode, if available, to enforce JSON output.**\n\n## Example in Python (pseudo-code)\n\n```python\nimport openai\n\n# Step 1: Initial request with tool/function\nresponse1 = openai.chat.completions.create(\n    model=\"gpt-4-0613\",\n    messages=[\n        {\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"What is the population of France?\"}\n    ],\n    tools=[...],  # Your tool definition\n    tool_choice=\"auto\"\n)\n\n# Step 2: Run your tool, get the result (e.g., population = 68000000)\n# Step 3: Send tool output and ask for JSON schema output\nresponse2 = openai.chat.completions.create(\n    model=\"gpt-4-0613\",\n    messages=[\n        {\"role\": \"system\", \"content\": \"Please output the result in the following JSON schema: {\\\"country\\\": string, \\\"population\\\": integer}\"},\n        {\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"What is the population of France?\"},\n        response1[\"choices\"][0][\"message\"],  # assistant/tool_call\n        {\"role\": \"tool\", \"tool_call_id\": ..., \"content\": \"{\\\"population\\\": 68000000}\"}\n    ]\n)\nprint(response2[\"choices\"][0][\"message\"][\"content\"])\n```\n\n---\n\n### If You're Having Issues\n\n- Please clarify what \"is common knowledge now, can you provide details?\" means in your context.\n- If the model is not considering the tool output, check your message history and roles.\n- If the JSON output is wrong, add a very explicit system message with the schema before the final step.\n\n**If you provide a code snippet or a more specific error/output you're getting, I can give more targeted advice!**",

Feel free to adapt the example to Python, Node.js, or whichever language or framework you are using.\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n1) High-Level Flow\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n\n   ┌───────────────────────┐\n   │   Your Application    │\n   └───────────────────────┘\n              │ \n     (a) Send prompt with instructions to the LLM\n              │\n              ▼ \n   ┌───────────────────────┐\n   │      OpenAI API       │\n   └───────────────────────┘\n              │\n     (b) LLM produces tool output (intermediate) \n              ↓\n   Your logic/code extracts or “parses” that output\n              ↓\n   ┌───────────────────────────────────────────────┐\n   │   Combine intermediate output as context     │\n   │   and finalize prompt (return to LLM again)  │\n   └───────────────────────────────────────────────┘\n              │\n              ▼\n   (c) LLM returns final output in desired schema\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n2) Intermediate “Tool” Output\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n\nSometimes you want the LLM to produce a piece of text that you will programmatically process before generating the final user-facing response. For example:\n\n• Step 1: The LLM calls or simulates a “tool” to get raw data (like searching a knowledge base, extracting key points, or enumerating options).  \n• Step 2: Your code takes that raw data, processes it if needed, and re-injects it back to the LLM with an updated prompt.  \n• Step 3: The LLM generates the final structured JSON output, informed by the raw data.  \n\nOne approach is to instruct the LLM to label or surround the “tool output” with specific tokens or a predictable format, so you can reliably parse it.  \n\nExample prompt snippet (first call):  \n------------------------------------------------------------------\nSystem/Developer Prompt:\n\"\nYou are an assistant that returns intermediate data in a 'TOOL OUTPUT' section. \nWhen the user asks for something, you must first produce your intermediate \nanalysis in a block labeled TOOL_OUTPUT: ... \nThen stop. \n\"\n\nUser:\n\"Find the capital of France and list two historical facts about it.\"\n------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nExample LLM response (first call), from which you parse “TOOL_OUTPUT”:  \n------------------------------------------------------------------\nTOOL_OUTPUT:\n{\n  \"capital_city\": \"Paris\",\n  \"historical_facts\": [\n    \"The Eiffel Tower was originally built as a temporary exhibit.\",\n    \"Paris was originally a Roman city called Lutetia.\"\n  ]\n}\n------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nYour code can detect the “TOOL_OUTPUT” label and parse the JSON. Then you have the intermediate data (the city = “Paris”, the facts = ...).\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n3) Re-injecting Context Before Final Output\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n\nNext, you pass that parsed data back to the LLM so it “knows” the tool output (like a knowledge base result). This typically looks like:\n\nExample prompt snippet (second call):  \n------------------------------------------------------------------\nSystem/Developer Prompt:\n\"\nYou have obtained the following tool results:\n{capital_city: 'Paris', historical_facts: [...]}.\n\nNow you must generate the final answer to the user in valid JSON. \nFollow this JSON schema exactly:\n\n{\n  \"city\": string,\n  \"facts\": [string, string],\n  \"recommended_restaurant\": string \n}\n\nConstruct 'recommended_restaurant' using your knowledge about Paris, \nand place it in the output. Output must be strictly valid JSON with \nonly the keys city, facts, and recommended_restaurant.\n\"\n\nUser:\n\"Now, please finalize the post using the data above.\"\n------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWhen the LLM replies, you have one chunk of final JSON that fits the schema. For example:\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------\n{\n  \"city\": \"Paris\",\n  \"facts\": [\n    \"The Eiffel Tower was originally built as a temporary exhibit.\",\n    \"Paris was originally a Roman city called Lutetia.\"\n  ],\n  \"recommended_restaurant\": \"Le Jules Verne (in the Eiffel Tower)\"\n}\n------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nYour code can now parse that final JSON.  \n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n4) Handling “It works whenever I use text: format: [...]”\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n\nSometimes you may have noticed that JSON is easier to parse if you instruct the model to omit additional explanatory text, code fences, or other formatting. You might do something like:\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------\nSystem/Developer Prompt:\n\"The user wants a JSON response only. No code blocks, no markdown. \nStrictly output JSON. If you are unsure, return an empty JSON object.\"\nUser Prompt:\n\"Give me a JSON with your recommended steps to learn guitar, \nfollowing this schema: { 'steps': [string, string, string] }\"\n------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nIf “It works whenever I use text: format:” means you previously found that the LLM was more likely to respond in pure text, that suggests that the model might have been ignoring or partially ignoring your instructions about formatting. Often, explicitly telling the model to output only JSON (no extra text) and verifying that you only read the part after your “text:” label can help.\n\nAlternatively, you can use function-calling (if using the OpenAI Chat Completion API with the new function calling feature). That can reliably return JSON from the model.\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n5) Summary & Tips\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n\n• Use a two-step approach: First “tool output,” then final answer.  \n• Format those two steps so they’re easy to programmatically parse.  \n• Supply the “tool output” as context to a second prompt, instructing the model to produce final JSON.  \n• Consider using the new function calling feature from OpenAI Chat API if you want strongly typed JSON or want to avoid extra parsing steps.  \n• Be explicit about the schema. If the model includes extra text, remind it to output only the JSON keys you specified.  \n• For reliability, ensure your system or developer message clarifies (a) the intended format (b) the content boundaries (structure, no extra text, etc.).  \n\nI hope these details help clarify how (a) to get intermediate results from the LLM, (b) parse them, and (c) finalize the response in a specific JSON schema. If you have more specific questions about your MCP server configuration or about the parsing step, feel free to elaborate so we can dive in further.",

How the flow works overall\n\n a. First, you invoke your tool (for example, via your MCP server) so that it produces an initial output. In your case you’re using a text: format (for instance, “text: …”) so that the output is a free‐form text snippet that everyone “knows” or that is treated as common knowledge. This output might include details extracted, summarized, or computed by your tool.\n\n b. Next, you include that output as context for the AI when you make the final API call. In that call, you instruct OpenAI to generate a response in a particular JSON schema. Because you already have the output ready from the tool, the model “knows” about that result and can use it to shape the final answer.\n\n2. Using openai.response.parse\n\n a. The openai.response.parse helper (or whichever wrapper you’re using) is designed to “post‐process” the AI’s text response. In many cases, you want not just any text but a text that conforms to a precise JSON schema. The parse function lets you validate or transform the raw AI output into structured JSON.\n\n b. When the tool’s output is formatted as text (with maybe a prefix such as “text: …”), it becomes part of the context that the AI can refer back to. Essentially, you’re “priming” the AI with prior knowledge before it outputs the final JSON answer.\n\n3. Why the text: format works as common knowledge\n\n a. Using the text: format is a natural way to pass along information from the tool to the chat context. It doesn’t require special formatting or JSON syntax at this stage (which might otherwise complicate the guidance) because you just need the AI to “know” something.\n\n b. The AI uses that previous output as background. It might see in the conversation history a message like, “Remember that text output: …” Then, when you instruct it to produce an answer formatted in a JSON schema, the model can incorporate that earlier knowledge automatically.\n\n4. Best practices and tips\n\n a. Chain the conversation properly: Use a multi-turn conversation where the tool’s output is provided in an earlier message (for example, as a system or assistant message). Then in your later prompt (often as a user message or subsequent system instruction), tell the model to incorporate that tool output when producing the final response.\n\n b. Be explicit in your prompts: For example, “Using the information provided above, please produce an output that matches the following JSON schema…”. The clearer you are about how the tool’s output should be used, the better the result.\n\n c. Validate your final output: Even when using openai.response.parse to enforce the JSON schema, consider doing an extra parse/validation step in your application code to catch any deviations.\n\n d. Provide an example: Sometimes it helps to show a sample JSON object in your instructions. For instance, include a message that says:\n  \"Example output:\n  {\n   \"key1\": \"value1\",\n   \"key2\": 123,\n   ...\n  }\"\n This example acts as a guide for the final formation.\n\n5. Putting it all together\n\nHere’s a conceptual outline in pseudo-code:\n\n----------------------------------------------------\n# Step 1: Get the initial output from the MCP tool\ntool_output = call_MCP_tool()  # returns something like \"text: detailed result from tool\"\n\n# Step 2: Send a prompt to the OpenAI API, including the tool output in prior messages\nmessages = [\n {\"role\": \"system\", \"content\": \"The following is prior knowledge: \" + tool_output},\n {\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"Given the above, produce a final answer in the following JSON schema: { ... your schema here ... }\"}\n]\n\nresponse = openai.ChatCompletion.create(model=\"gpt-model\", messages=messages)\nfinal_text = response.choices[0].message.content\n\n# Step 3: Parse using openai.response.parse \nfinal_json = openai.response.parse(final_text, schema=your_defined_schema)\n\n----------------------------------------------------\n\nThis approach makes sure that:\n • The tool’s output is explicitly made available to the model.\n • The final prompt instructs the model to use that output.\n • The response is then parsed/validated to conform to the given JSON schema.\n\nConclusion\n\nBy using the text: format for transferring the tool’s output, you essentially create a “common ground” or “common knowledge” for the AI. It simplifies the chaining of outputs and ensures that when the final output is requested (in JSON format), the model already has the necessary context. Using openai.response.parse after the call guarantees that even if the generated output isn’t perfect, you can enforce your schema requirements.\n\nI hope these details help clarify the process!

The issue you're describing - where it works with \"is common knowledge now\" but not otherwise - suggests a prompt engineering challenge where the AI needs clearer context about when and how to use the tool results.\n\nHere are some strategies to improve reliability:\n\n## 1. Explicit Multi-Step Instructions\n\n```python\nsystem_prompt = \"\"\"\nYou are an assistant that follows a specific workflow:\n\nSTEP 1: Use the available tools to gather necessary information\nSTEP 2: Analyze the tool results \nSTEP 3: Provide your final response in the required JSON schema\n\nAlways complete STEP 1 before proceeding to your final response.\n\"\"\"\n```\n\n## 2. Structured Prompt with Clear Phases\n\n```python\nuser_prompt = f\"\"\"\nPlease help me with: {user_question}\n\nPHASE 1: First, use the appropriate tools to gather relevant information.\nPHASE 2: Then, based on the tool results, provide your final answer in the specified JSON format.\n\nBegin with PHASE 1 - gather the information first.\n\"\"\"\n```\n\n## 3. Response Format Guidance\n\n```python\nsystem_prompt = \"\"\"\nWhen using tools:\n1. Always call relevant tools first to gather information\n2. Wait for tool results before forming conclusions\n3. Reference the tool results in your reasoning\n4. Then structure your final response according to the JSON schema\n\nDo not rely on your training data alone - use the tools to get current/specific information.\n\"\"\"\n```\n\n## 4. Example Implementation Pattern\n\n```python\nresponse = client.beta.chat.completions.parse(\n    model=\"gpt-4o\",\n    messages=[\n        {\n            \"role\": \"system\", \n            \"content\": \"\"\"You must follow this exact process:\n            1. Use tools to gather required information\n            2. Analyze tool results\n            3. Format final response per schema\n            \n            Never skip step 1. Always use tools before providing final answers.\"\"\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"role\": \"user\", \n            \"content\": f\"Research and then answer: {question}\\n\\nFirst use tools to gather information, then provide structured response.\"\n        }\n    ],\n    tools=your_tools,\n    response_format=YourSchema\n)\n```\n\n## 5. Add Reasoning Chain\n\n```python\nclass ResponseSchema(BaseModel):\n    tool_results_summary: str  # Force AI to acknowledge tool usage\n    analysis: str\n    final_answer: str\n    confidence: float\n```\n\nThe key insight is that \"common knowledge\" phrasing works because it implies the AI should verify/supplement its knowledge, whereas direct questions might make it rely on training data. Try making tool usage more explicit and mandatory in your prompts.\n\nWould you like me to help you adapt any of these patterns to your specific MCP server setup?",

Here's an example with function calling (Python-like pseudocode):\n\n```python\nimport openai\n\n# Step 1: Get tool output\ntool_output = run_my_tool(input_data)\n\n# Step 2: Compose message for OpenAI API\nmessages = [\n    {\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"Here is the tool output: \" + tool_output},\n    {\"role\": \"system\", \"content\": \"Given the tool output, provide a summary and recommendation in this schema: {\\\"summary\\\": \\\"...\\\", \\\"recommendation\\\": \\\"...\\\", \\\"tool_output\\\": \\\"...\\\"}\"}\n]\n\nresponse = openai.ChatCompletion.create(\n    model=\"gpt-4\",\n    messages=messages,\n    functions=[\n        {\n            \"name\": \"final_output\",\n            \"parameters\": {\n                \"type\": \"object\",\n                \"properties\": {\n                    \"summary\": {\"type\": \"string\"},\n                    \"recommendation\": {\"type\": \"string\"},\n                    \"tool_output\": {\"type\": \"string\"},\n                },\n                \"required\": [\"summary\", \"recommendation\", \"tool_output\"]\n            }\n        }\n    ],\n    function_call=\"final_output\"\n)\n\nfinal_json = response.choices[0].message.function_call.arguments\n```\n\n## Tips & Troubleshooting\n\n- **Prompt Clarity:** Be explicit in your system prompt about the exact JSON schema. Ambiguity often leads to failures in parsing.\n- **Function Calling (GPT-4/3.5):** Use OpenAI's function calling feature if you want strict JSON output.\n- **Error Handling:** If the AI sometimes fails to output valid JSON, consider using openai.response.parse or a JSON validation step to catch and retry on errors.\n- **Debugging:** If it \"works with text: format\" but not otherwise, compare the prompts. Perhaps the schema or instructions aren't being parsed correctly by the model.\n- **Chaining:** Always pass the tool output as-is in the user message or as a system instruction to ensure the AI can base its response on it.\n\n## If You're Hitting a Specific Error\n\nIf you're seeing a parsing error or a specific failure point, please provide:\n\n- The exact error message\n- The relevant code snippet\n- The schema or prompt you're using\n\nThat will allow for more targeted troubleshooting!\n\n---\n\n**Let me know if you can clarify the exact issue (maybe paste the error or the problematic prompt), and I can give you more specific help!**",

You want to parse that intermediate result using openai.response.parse (or a similar mechanism).  \n3. You then want to feed that parsed data back into another AI prompt (or function call) so that the model can produce a final JSON response with a specific schema.  \n\nAnd it only seems to work as expected when you include some particular text (e.g., text: format: \"won't come again\")—which suggests that there may be a quoting, escaping, or general JSON-formatting issue somewhere in your process.\n\nBelow are a few troubleshooting tips and examples you can try.\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n1) Make sure your prompts and JSON are well-formatted\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n• JSON data must use double quotes \" not single quotes ' around keys and string values.  \n• If you include strings with apostrophes (e.g., “won’t”), you typically need to escape them if they’re inside another quoted string, for example:  \n  \"text\": \"He won\\'t come again\"  \n\n• Confirm the Python / Node / etc. environment you’re using is not accidentally altering quotes or escaping.  \n\n• In practice, whenever you embed strings in JSON, test them with a parser (e.g., a quick test in the browser console with JSON.parse(...) or in a Python REPL) to confirm that the structure is valid.\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n2) Use OpenAI’s function-calling (if available) for structured output\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nIf you have access to a model that supports “function calling,” you might find it more reliable than manually parsing JSON. Instead of telling the model “Please output this in JSON,” you define a function schema with the arguments you want, and let the model return a structured object. For example:\n\n{\n  \"name\": \"create_user_profile\",\n  \"description\": \"Create a user profile with the following data.\",\n  \"parameters\": {\n    \"type\": \"object\",\n    \"properties\": {\n      \"username\": { \"type\": \"string\" },\n      \"age\": { \"type\": \"number\" },\n      \"comments\": { \"type\": \"string\" }\n    },\n    \"required\": [\"username\", \"age\"]\n  }\n}\n\nWhen you call the model, you do something like:\n\nresponse = openai.ChatCompletion.create(\n  model=\"gpt-4-0613\",\n  messages=[\n    {\"role\": \"system\", \"content\": \"You are a helpful data assistant.\"},\n    {\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"Please build a user profile for Alice, 24 years old.\"}\n  ],\n  functions=[create_user_profile_schema],\n  function_call={\"name\": \"create_user_profile\"}\n)\n\nThe model will return a JSON-like structure, and you won’t need to guess at quotes or braces—it systematically returns a well-formed “arguments” object in its function call.\n\n─────────────────────────────────────────────────\n3) Double-check how you are parsing the response\n─────────────────────────────────────────────────\nIf you’re using openai.response.parse (perhaps from a community library or your own utility function), verify that:\n  \n• The function is receiving valid JSON (or valid text that can be turned into JSON).  \n• If the model’s response includes extraneous text—like disclaimers, “Sure, here you go,” or markdown blocks—you may need to trim or filter those before parsing.  \n• For multi-step logic, you might store the intermediate result in a variable, parse it carefully, then create a brand-new prompt string for the final request.\n\n───────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n4) Inspect raw API responses in your MCP server logs\n───────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nFinally, check your logging. If your server or the library you’re using truncates or modifies the text before you see it, that can cause unexpected parse successes/failures.  \n\n• Try turning on debug or verbose logging so you can see exactly what comes back from the OpenAI endpoint.  \n• Paste that raw response into a JSON validator or parse it directly in a REPL to ensure it’s valid.\n\n───────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nNext steps\n───────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nIf none of these solve the issue, it would help to see:  \n• A minimal code snippet showing how you call openai.response.parse.  \n• The intermediate output that’s causing trouble (or working fine when you use \"won’t come again\").  \n• Any errors, exceptions, or parse failures from your server logs.\n\nWith that information, it’s much easier to spot whether there’s a subtle formatting problem or a mismatch between how you expect the responses to look and how the model is actually returning them.

(I’m also reading your note that it works when you have the tool’s output in a “text” format, but when you try to change the format it’s not working as expected.) There are a few points to consider:\n\n1. How the intermediate output is formatted:  \n • When you produce the tool’s output as plain text (using something like text: \"…\"), it appears that the API is able to simply include that into the context that then guides the final JSON output.  \n • When you try to output something that isn’t plain text (or use a different format key), the openai.response.parse function might not “see” the result correctly. Ensure that the tool’s final output is actually a string (or something that can be embedded into the prompt) that the parser can then use. Sometimes extra formatting or non‐string types means the context doesn’t get “consumed” properly.\n\n2. Making the intermediate result “visible” to the final prompt:  \n • After your tool generates its output, you must make sure that the prompt for your final call includes that result. One pattern is to insert a placeholder like “Tool Output:” followed by the actual tool result (as text).  \n • For example, your prompt for the final output might say something like:  \n  \"Below is the output from my tool that you must consider before providing your final answer in the following JSON format.  \n  Tool Output: <insert_tool_output_here>  \n  [Now produce an answer in which your final answer exactly follows this JSON schema: {...}]\"\n\n3. Using openai.response.parse correctly:  \n • The openai.response.parse tool typically expects the model’s final answer to be in a particular format. If your tool’s output is embedded in the prompt (and it is plain text), then the parser can extract or verify the JSON schema.  \n • If you supply data ‘by reference’ (for example, using a different key or wrapping the tool’s output in a structure that isn’t plain text), the parser might not “see” it and so might not trigger your logic for the final JSON output.\n\n4. Debugging:  \n • Double-check that your MCP server is sending the entire conversation history (including the tool’s output) to the API, and that there isn’t a formatting issue or missing whitespace that causes the parser to “miss” the tool’s output.  \n • Use logging or print the prompt that ends up being sent to the API so you can verify that the tool’s output appears exactly as expected.  \n • And if you’re using a custom parser with openai.response.parse, make sure its configuration is compatible with non-text (or text that comes from a different field) if you intend to support that.\n\nIn short, if it works when using text output, it likely means the parser is built to search for that raw text. If you want to change formats (for instance, to JSON), you might need to either adjust the parser’s expectations or convert your output into a text string that represents the JSON. This also includes making sure the final prompt explicitly refers to the tool’s earlier result.\n\nIf you can provide a bit more context or a code snippet, I’d be happy to help further troubleshoot the specific issue with the non-text format.",

Noted: It works when you use text: format: ‘, but the rest of your message was cut off.\n\nSome clarifying questions and guidance:\n\n### 1. Are You Chaining Tool Outputs?\nIf you want the AI to consider previous tool outputs, you typically need to:\n- Save the output from the tool.\n- Pass it as context (in the prompt or as a message) to the next call to the OpenAI API.\n- Then instruct the AI to produce output in your desired JSON schema.\n\n**Example Flow (pseudocode):**\n```python\n# Step 1: Get tool output\ntool_output = run_tool(input_data)\n\n# Step 2: Pass tool output to OpenAI API\nprompt = f\"\"\"Tool output:\n{tool_output}\n\nNow, considering the above, produce a final output in this JSON schema:\n{{\"field1\": ..., \"field2\": ...}}\n\"\"\"\nresponse = openai.ChatCompletion.create(\n    model=\"gpt-4\",\n    messages=[{\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": prompt}],\n    response_format={\"type\": \"json_object\"}\n)\n```\n\n### 2. Using `response_format`\nIf you set `response_format={\"type\": \"json_object\"}` in the OpenAI API, the model will try to return a valid JSON object. This typically works best with the newer API endpoints (v1/chat/completions).\n\n### 3. Issues with Text vs. JSON Format\nIf you say \"It works whenever I use text: format:\", perhaps you mean that you get valid responses when you ask for plain text, but not when you enforce JSON?\n\n- **If using `text`:** The model outputs human-readable text, which isn't guaranteed to be valid JSON.\n- **If using `json_object`:** The model is more constrained; if your prompt or tool output is ambiguous, the model might error or fail to match your schema.\n\n### 4. Recommendations\n\n- Ensure your prompt is clear about the required JSON schema.\n- If parsing fails, check if the tool output includes special characters, nested quotes, or other formatting that might confuse the model when producing JSON.\n- Try explicitly wrapping the tool output in triple quotes (\"\"\") or providing as a variable to minimize prompt injection or formatting errors.\n\n### 5. Example Prompt Template\nHere’s a robust template:\n\n```python\ntool_output = ... # your MCP tool result\n\nprompt = f\"\"\"\nYou are a threat intelligence analyst. Here is the tool output:\n\\\"\\\"\\\"\n{tool_output}\n\\\"\\\"\\\"\n\nBased on this, produce your final analysis in the following JSON schema:\n{{\n    \"threat_level\": \"low|medium|high\",\n    \"indicators\": [\"list\", \"of\", \"ioc\"],\n    \"summary\": \"string\"\n}}\nRespond ONLY in valid JSON.\n\"\"\"\n\nresponse = openai.ChatCompletion.create(\n    model=\"gpt-4-1106-preview\",\n    messages=[{\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": prompt}],\n    response_format={\"type\": \"json_object\"}\n)\n```\n\n### 6. Troubleshooting\n\n- If your tool output is very long, consider summarizing or extracting only relevant fields before passing to the model.\n- Use a schema validator to catch any slight mismatches in the JSON output.\n- Try incrementally simplifying your prompt to isolate where the process breaks.\n\n---\n\n**If you can provide the rest of your question (what happens when you don't use text: format, or what specific errors you're encountering), I can give you much more targeted advice!**",

          "response": "Below is a general walkthrough of how you can take an intermediate AI-generated output, feed it back into your system (or prompt), and then produce a final JSON schema output—whether you are using the “text” format or OpenAI function calls. I’ll outline several approaches; you can adapt whichever fits your current tooling with openai.response.parse or a similar utility.\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n1. Understanding the Two-Step Process\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nYou’ve described a process that has two major steps:\n\n1) Use the model (or a “tool”) to generate an intermediate output.  \n2) Pass that intermediate output back to the model (or next step in the chain) so it can be considered before producing the final JSON stub in a required schema.\n\nSometimes, the difficulty is ensuring the intermediate output remains accessible and structured when you move to the second step. If you simply feed the OpenAI text output (say, a block of plain text) without controlling its format, it can be prone to drifting away from a robust JSON structure. That’s where clarifying the format—“text:” vs. “json:”—and carefully prompting (or using function calling) helps.\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n2. Approach A: Traditional Prompt Chaining with Text\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nIf your workflow “just works” whenever you use a prompt that expects text, you can continue with that method, but be very explicit in your instructions:\n\n1) First API Call (intermediate data generation):\n   • Prompt the model for some intelligence analysis or partial summary—whatever the “tool” is producing.  \n   • Make sure to store this raw text output in a variable.  \n\n2) Second API Call (final JSON schema):\n   • Take the stored output from step 1, and include it inside your second prompt’s context.  \n   • Explicitly instruct the model to read that text, interpret it, and produce the final JSON structure.  \n\nExample (pseudo-code):\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n# Step 1: Obtain the intermediate result\nprompt_step1 = \"\"\"\nYou are a threat intelligence assistant. Summarize the key threat indicators \nand highlight any IOCs in plain text form.\n\"\"\"\nresponse_step1 = openai.ChatCompletion.create(\n    model=\"gpt-4\",\n    messages=[ {\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": prompt_step1} ],\n)\nintermediate_output = response_step1[\"choices\"][0][\"message\"][\"content\"]\n\n# Step 2: Use the intermediate result to produce JSON\nprompt_step2 = f\"\"\"\nYou have the following intermediate analysis: \n{intermediate_output}\n\nBased on that analysis, produce a JSON object that follows this schema:\n{{\n  \"threat_indicators\": [ ... ],\n  \"recommended_mitigations\": [ ... ],\n  \"confidence_score\": ...\n}}\n\nOnly output valid JSON. Do not include any extra text.\n\"\"\"\nresponse_step2 = openai.ChatCompletion.create(\n    model=\"gpt-4\",\n    messages=[ {\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": prompt_step2} ],\n)\nfinal_json = response_step2[\"choices\"][0][\"message\"][\"content\"]\n\n# Now you can parse final_json for further use\nparsed_json = json.loads(final_json)\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nIn this approach, you rely on carefully-crafted instructions around the text output. You then parse the final JSON from the second response. This is the simplest version, albeit not always the most structured.\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n3. Approach B: Using OpenAI Function Calling\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nIf you prefer a more structured approach (especially if you want to rely on openai.response.parse or a function-calling pattern), you can define a “function” that expects a specific JSON schema as its arguments. The steps are conceptually similar, but the final response from the model will arrive in the form of a “function call” with strictly-typed arguments, which are already JSON. Here’s how:\n\n1) Define the function you want the model to “call” as a JSON schema:\n   - Give the function a name.  \n   - Provide JSON Schema for its parameters.  \n\n2) Send the user query alongside your function definition.  \n3) Let the model produce a function call with the necessary arguments.  \n4) Parse the function call arguments from the response.\n\nExample (pseudo-code):\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nfunctions_list = [\n  {\n    \"name\": \"generate_threat_report\",\n    \"description\": \"Generates a structured threat analysis report\",\n    \"parameters\": {\n      \"type\": \"object\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"threat_indicators\": {\n          \"type\": \"array\",\n          \"items\": { \"type\": \"string\" },\n          \"description\": \"List of threat indicators\"\n        },\n        \"recommended_mitigations\": {\n          \"type\": \"array\",\n          \"items\": { \"type\": \"string\" },\n          \"description\": \"List of recommended mitigations\"\n        },\n        \"confidence_score\": {\n          \"type\": \"number\",\n          \"description\": \"Confidence rating from 0-1\"\n        }\n      },\n      \"required\": [\"threat_indicators\", \"recommended_mitigations\", \"confidence_score\"]\n    }\n  }\n]\n\n# Step 1: Summarize or generate the relevant data (if needed).\n# Instead of direct text, we can do a normal chat or short prompt, or pass user query as context.\n\nintermediate_prompt = \"Please list any identified IOCs from the data, then finalize a risk rating.\"\nresponse_step1 = openai.ChatCompletion.create(\n    model=\"gpt-4\",\n    messages=[\n      {\"role\": \"system\", \"content\": \"You are a threat intelligence assistant.\"},\n      {\"role\": \"user\",   \"content\": intermediate_prompt}\n    ]\n)\nintermediate_output = response_step1[\"choices\"][0][\"message\"][\"content\"]\n\n# Step 2: Prompt for the final function call, including the intermediate output:\nfinal_prompt = f\"\"\"\nWe have the following analysis result:\n{intermediate_output}\n\nNow produce a function call for generate_threat_report with the final \nstructured JSON to summarize the threat indicators, recommended mitigations, \nand confidence score. \n\"\"\"\n\nresponse_step2 = openai.ChatCompletion.create(\n  model=\"gpt-4\",\n  messages=[\n    {\"role\": \"system\", \"content\": \"You are a threat intelligence assistant.\"},\n    {\"role\": \"user\",   \"content\": final_prompt}\n  ],\n  functions=functions_list,\n  function_call={\"name\": \"generate_threat_report\"}  # or \"auto\"\n)\n\n# The final JSON arguments appear in function_call[\"arguments\"]\n# You can parse them directly with json.loads\nfunc_call = response_step2[\"choices\"][0][\"message\"][\"function_call\"]\narguments_json = json.loads(func_call[\"arguments\"])\n\nprint(arguments_json)\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nBy using function calling, you enforce a strict JSON structure in the final output. You also get structured arguments that are easy to parse and store—often simpler than dealing with raw text blocks.\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n4. Common Pitfalls & Tips\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n• Make sure you enclose the intermediate output in quotes or triple-backticks if there’s a risk the text contains special characters.  \n• In your second step prompt, be explicit that you only want valid JSON output (or a function call), and that the model should not add extra commentary.  \n• If you use function calling, ensure that your “parameters” schema matches exactly what you want to capture in your JSON—they will be enforced at generation time.  \n• If you find that including the entire intermediate output confuses the model (especially if it’s large), consider summarizing or extracting only what’s crucial for the final JSON.  \n• For especially large intermediate outputs, you might store it in a short variable or chunk it into smaller segments.  \n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n5. Putting It All Together\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n• If “text:” format currently works well for your chaining, continue using that approach, but be explicit in your instructions to preserve JSON formatting at the final step.  \n• If you want stronger enforcement of JSON structure (and you have an updated model that supports function calling), consider that approach for a more robust pipeline.  \n• Regardless of approach, you’ll typically gather the intermediate output in a variable, then feed it back into the next prompt (or function call).  \n\nI hope these outlines clarify how to capture an intermediate AI result, have the model consider it, and then produce strictly valid JSON that matches a given schema. Let me know if you have more specific details on the MCP server integration or the particular “openai.response.parse” workflow, and I can dive deeper into that portion.",

          "response": "It sounds like you’re trying to “chain” an initial tool output (from your MCP server) into a second stage that uses OpenAI’s response parsing (openai.response.parse) to deliver a final answer that conforms to a strict JSON schema. I’ll break down some techniques and pitfalls you might be encountering, along with suggestions on how to structure your prompt and output for this chaining to work as intended.\n\n1. Clarify the Two Stages\n\n a. Stage 1: You call your MCP server (or another tool) and receive an output in text format. This output conveys threat intelligence details (or whatever data you need).\n\n b. Stage 2: You pass the tool output to OpenAI. In your prompt you instruct the model to “consider” (i.e. review or analyze) that output, then generate the final answer in your required JSON schema.\n\n2. Why the “text:” Format Might Work\n\n • When you use the “text:” format, you’re essentially providing a free-form prompt. Text prompts let you directly weave the tool’s output into say, “Based on the MCP output below, please …” That free-form text is easier for the model to “absorb” and then structure the answer accordingly.\n\n • When you try to use a JSON directive (rather than plain text) prematurely, the formatting might be too rigid—the parser might not “see” the intermediate text as part of the chain of thought. It could also be that the parser’s instructions aren’t allowing the model enough “room” to integrate the tool output fully.\n\n3. How to Incorporate the Tool Output into the Final Prompt\n\nConsider this kind of prompt structure:\n\n • Start with context: “I am feeding you the output from our MCP server that contains threat intelligence details regarding [incident]. Please review the following data carefully.”\n • Insert the tool’s output in a clearly marked block (preferably with delimiters so the model knows where it begins and ends).\n • Provide instructions: “Based on the above data, please generate your final analysis using the following JSON schema: {specify your schema here, e.g., {‘threatLevel’: <string>, ‘indicators’: <array>, …}}.”\n\nHere’s a pseudo-example:\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\nSystem Prompt:\n[Context]\n“You are a threat intelligence analyst. Below is raw output from our MCP server. Study it in detail and then produce a final assessment in the JSON format specified.\n\nData from MCP:\n<<<START MCP OUTPUT\n[Insert the text output from the MCP server here]\n<<<END MCP OUTPUT\n\nFinal JSON Schema:\n{\n  'analysis': <string>,\n  'threatLevel': <string>,\n  'indicators': [<string>, ...],\n  'recommendations': <string>\n}\n\nPlease ensure the final answer is in valid JSON, exactly matching the keys listed above.”\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n4. Using OpenAI’s responses API With a Parser\n\nWhen using openai.response.parse, you need the AI’s response to reliably match your JSON schema. A few tips:\n\n • Explicitly instruct the model to output only valid JSON, with no extra commentary.\n • If your tool output is very large, consider summarizing or highlighting key segments before pushing it into the analysis.\n • Validate your JSON schema and test with some sample outputs. This can help catch format errors early on.\n\n5. Considerations for Intermediate “Chain of Thought”\n\nSometimes it helps to allow the model to “think” (internally, as a chain-of-thought) even if that isn’t exposed in the final output. Some developers have found success by layering instructions so that:\n a) The model reasons internally (chain-of-thought),\n b) But only outputs the final JSON result.\n\nThis can be achieved by explicitly saying, “Do your internal reasoning, but only output the final JSON in your response.”\n\n6. Troubleshooting When It Doesn’t Work\n\n • If your JSON schema output isn’t coming through:\n  – Double-check that your instructions are not inadvertently prompting a text explanation before or after the JSON.\n  – Ensure that the delimiters (“<<<START …”, “<<<END …”) are unambiguous.\n  – Confirm that the parser you’re using isn’t expecting a slightly different hint. Sometimes, using “json:” format versus “text:” format will trigger different parsing behavior. In your tests, when you switch to a simple text prompt, it works—implying that the AI’s natural language processing more easily handles free-form text before you constrain the output.\n\n • Ensure that your final request instructs the model “to consider all the preceding data” so it doesn’t ignore the MCP output.\n\n7. Example Final Prompt in Code\n\nIf you’re implementing this in code, a Python pseudocode example might look like:\n\n-------------------------------------------------\nmcp_output = get_mcp_server_output()  # your tool call\n\nprompt = f\"\"\"\nYou are a threat intelligence analyst. I will give you raw output from our MCP server and then ask you to provide a final analysis.\n\nMCP Output:\n<<<START\n{mcp_output}\n<<<END\n\nBased on the above data, please generate a final analysis using the following JSON schema:\n{{\n  \"analysis\": \"<string summary of the incident>\",\n  \"threatLevel\": \"<low/medium/high>\",\n  \"indicators\": [\"indicator1\", \"indicator2\", \"...\"],\n  \"recommendations\": \"<actions to mitigate>\"\n}}\n\nRemember: Do all your internal reasoning, but only output valid JSON that matches the exact schema. No extra text.\n\"\"\"\n\nfinal_output = openai.response.parse(prompt)\n-------------------------------------------------\n\nBy following this kind of pattern, you give the model both the context it needs (MCP output) and a strict guideline on the final answer.\n\n8. Summary\n\n• The “text:” format may work better because it gives the AI the freedom to integrate the tool’s output in its reasoning.\n• Ensure that your chained prompt clearly instructs the AI to consider the initial output before producing the final JSON answer.\n• Validate that your expected JSON format is unambiguous and that your parser is set to extract only that final JSON chunk.\n• Test incrementally: first, check that your MCP output is correctly inserted, then that the final JSON is produced without additional commentary.\n\nBy carefully structuring your prompt and clarifying the two-stage process, you should be able to reliably get the desired final output in your JSON schema using openai.response.parse. If you run into further issues, try simplifying the prompt to debug where in the chain the output formatting changes.\n\nI hope this helps clarify the approach and potential pitfalls—you can then refine the process by testing various prompt structures until you achieve consistent results.",

          "response": "It seems your question was cut off. However, based on what you've provided so far, let me restate my understanding of your scenario clearly:\n\nYou have an MCP (Managed Content Processor or similar middleware/processing server) integrated with OpenAI's API. You're specifically using `openai.response.parse` to handle responses. The workflow you are aiming for is:\n\n1. You make a request to OpenAI's API.\n2. You receive initial output from OpenAI in a certain text format.\n3. You leverage your MCP server to parse or process this initial output.\n4. You want OpenAI to then reconsider or further process this parsed output to produce a final result conforming strictly to a specified JSON schema.\n\nIt sounds like your current implementation successfully works whenever you use something like:\n\n```\ntext:\n  format: '\n```\n\nbut you're running into issues when attempting to produce the final JSON-formatted output.\n\n### Common Pitfalls and Recommendations:\n\n1. **Clarify Prompt and Format:**\n   - When requesting OpenAI to produce structured JSON output, use a clear prompt instruction such as:\n   ```\n   \"Provide your response strictly in the following JSON format:\n   {\n      \"field1\": \"value1\",\n      \"field2\": \"value2\",\n      ...\n   }\"\n   ```\n   This explicit format instruction encourages the model to adhere strictly to the specified schema.\n\n2. **Use System Instructions to Reinforce JSON Structure:**\n   - If you're using the GPT-3.5 Turbo or GPT-4 models, leverage the `system` prompt to reinforce the requirement:\n   ```json\n   {\n     \"role\": \"system\",\n     \"content\": \"You are an assistant that always outputs responses strictly matching the provided JSON schema.\"\n   }\n   ```\n\n3. **Parsing Intermediate Output and Re-prompting:**\n   - If you receive an intermediate response and process it on your MCP server, clearly feed the processed intermediate result back into the next prompt to OpenAI:\n   ```json\n   {\n     \"role\": \"user\",\n     \"content\": \"Given the following processed data from the previous response, produce the final output strictly adhering to the JSON schema provided earlier: [processed MCP output]\"\n   }\n   ```\n\n4. **JSON Formatting Best Practices:**\n   - Ensure your MCP server explicitly sends clear JSON schemas in your requests to OpenAI. For example:\n   ```json\n   {\n     \"role\": \"user\",\n     \"content\": \"Based on the following information and previous outputs, please generate your final response strictly in this JSON format: {\\\"field1\\\": \\\"\\\", \\\"field2\\\": false, \\\"field3\\\": []}\"\n   }\n   ```\n\n5. **Robust Error Handling and JSON Validation:**\n   - Even with good instructions, the model may occasionally deviate slightly. Consider using JSON parsing validation on your MCP server to validate the AI output. If validation fails, implement logic to automatically retry or re-prompt the AI with clearer instructions.\n\n### Example Workflow:\n\n**Step 1 (Initial Request):**\n```\nPrompt: \"Analyze the following threat intelligence data and summarize your findings briefly.\"\n```\n\n**Step 2 (Intermediate Response from OpenAI):**\n- MCP server receives and parses this response. You use `openai.response.parse` to extract essential details.\n\n**Step 3 (Final Request with MCP-processed Output):**\n```\nPrompt: \"Given the below summarized findings: [MCP extracted data], explicitly generate your final response strictly matching the following JSON schema:\n{\n   \"threat_name\": \"\",\n   \"severity\": \"\",\n   \"affected_systems\": [],\n   \"recommendations\": \"\"\n}\"\n```\n\n**Step 4 (Final JSON Response from OpenAI):**\n- OpenAI returns a structured JSON response exactly matching your provided schema.\n\n### Troubleshooting Steps:\n- Confirm that your MCP server correctly parses intermediate responses.\n- Explicitly instruct the model to output strictly JSON-formatted responses.\n- Validate outputs at each stage and implement retries or re-prompts for non-compliant outputs.\n\n---\n\nIf this addresses your problem, great!

Your goal is to process an initial output through the AI system before generating a final output in a specific JSON schema. I can provide some guidance on how to approach this:\n\n1. Initial API Call:\nFirst, make your initial API call to OpenAI to get the preliminary output. This might look something like:\n\n```python\nimport openai\n\nopenai.api_key = 'your-api-key'\n\nresponse = openai.Completion.create(\n  engine=\"text-davinci-002\",\n  prompt=\"Your initial prompt here\",\n  max_tokens=150\n)\n\ninitial_output = response.choices[0].text.strip()\n```\n\n2. Parse the Response:\nUse openai.response.parse to process the initial output. This step might involve extracting specific information or formatting the data.\n\n```python\nparsed_output = openai.response.parse(initial_output)\n```\n\n3. Second API Call:\nMake a second API call, using the parsed output as part of your prompt. This allows the AI to consider the initial output before generating the final response.\n\n```python\nfinal_response = openai.Completion.create(\n  engine=\"text-davinci-002\",\n  prompt=f\"Consider this information: {parsed_output}\\n\\nNow, provide a response in the following JSON schema: [Your schema here]\",\n  max_tokens=200\n)\n\nfinal_output = final_response.choices[0].text.strip()\n```\n\n4. Ensure JSON Format:\nTo ensure the output is in the correct JSON format, you might want to use Python's json module to load and dump the response:\n\n```python\nimport json\n\ntry:\n    json_output = json.loads(final_output)\n    formatted_json = json.dumps(json_output, indent=2)\n    print(formatted_json)\nexcept json.JSONDecodeError:\n    print(\"The output was not in valid JSON format.\")\n```\n\nThis approach should allow you to get an initial output, have the AI consider it, and then provide a final output in your desired JSON schema. \n\nRemember to handle potential errors, such as API rate limits or unexpected responses. Also, ensure that your prompts are clear and specific to get the most accurate and useful responses from the AI.\n\nIf you're experiencing issues with the text format, double-check that your prompt is correctly formatted and that you're using the appropriate OpenAI engine for your needs. The \"text-davinci-002\" engine is generally good for complex tasks, but depending on your specific requirements, you might want to explore other options like \"text-davinci-003\" or the more recent GPT-3.5 or GPT-4 models.",

This is a common challenge when combining tool calls with structured outputs.\n\nHere are the most likely causes and solutions:\n\n## Common Issues & Solutions\n\n### 1. **Tool Call Timing in Structured Output**\nThe structured output format may be interfering with the tool execution flow:\n\n```python\n# Instead of this problematic approach:\nresponse = client.beta.chat.completions.parse(\n    model=\"gpt-4\",\n    messages=[\n        {\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"Get threat data and analyze\"},\n    ],\n    tools=[mcp_tool],\n    response_format=YourSchema,  # This can cause issues\n)\n\n# Try this two-step approach:\n# Step 1: Execute tool calls first\ntool_response = client.chat.completions.create(\n    model=\"gpt-4\",\n    messages=[{\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"Get threat data\"}],\n    tools=[mcp_tool],\n)\n\n# Step 2: Use tool output for structured response\nfinal_response = client.beta.chat.completions.parse(\n    model=\"gpt-4\",\n    messages=[\n        {\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"Analyze this threat data\"},\n        {\"role\": \"assistant\", \"content\": tool_response.choices[0].message.content},\n        {\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"Provide analysis in required format\"}\n    ],\n    response_format=YourSchema,\n)\n```\n\n### 2. **MCP Server Response Format**\nEnsure your MCP server returns data compatible with structured parsing:\n\n```python\n# In your MCP server tool handler:\n@server.call_tool()\nasync def get_threat_intel(arguments):\n    # Ensure clean, parseable output\n    result = await fetch_threat_data(arguments)\n    \n    # Return structured data that won't interfere with JSON parsing\n    return {\n        \"content\": [\n            {\n                \"type\": \"text\",\n                \"text\": json.dumps(result, ensure_ascii=False)  # Clean JSON string\n            }\n        ]\n    }\n```\n\n### 3. **Schema Compatibility Check**\nVerify your Pydantic schema doesn't conflict with tool outputs:\n\n```python\nfrom pydantic import BaseModel\nfrom typing import Optional, Any\n\nclass ThreatAnalysisSchema(BaseModel):\n    # Ensure all fields are properly typed\n    threat_level: str\n    indicators: list[str]\n    analysis: str\n    tool_data: Optional[dict] = None  # Include space for tool output\n    \n    class Config:\n        # Allow extra fields from tool output\n        extra = \"allow\"\n```\n\n### 4. **Message Flow Strategy**\nFor threat intelligence workflows, consider this pattern:\n\n```python\nasync def analyze_with_mcp_and_structure(query: str):\n    # Phase 1: Tool execution\n    tool_messages = [\n        {\"role\": \"system\", \"content\": \"You are a threat intelligence analyst. Use tools to gather data, then I'll ask for structured analysis.\"},\n        {\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": f\"Gather threat intelligence for: {query}\"}\n    ]\n    \n    tool_response = await client.chat.completions.create(\n        model=\"gpt-4\",\n        messages=tool_messages,\n        tools=mcp_tools,\n    )\n    \n    # Phase 2: Structured analysis\n    analysis_messages = tool_messages + [\n        {\"role\": \"assistant\", \"content\": tool_response.choices[0].message.content},\n        {\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"Now provide a structured threat analysis based on the gathered data.\"}\n    ]\n    \n    structured_response = await client.beta.chat.completions.parse(\n        model=\"gpt-4\",\n        messages=analysis_messages,\n        response_format=ThreatAnalysisSchema,\n    )\n    \n    return structured_response.parsed\n```\n\n### 5. **Debugging Steps**\n\n1. **Check MCP tool output format**:\n```python\n# Log the raw tool output\nprint(\"MCP",

Clarify the Flow  \nLet’s break down what you want to achieve:\n\n- Step 1: Use a tool (maybe a function or plugin) to get some output (e.g., threat analysis).\n- Step 2: Have the AI review/consider that tool output.\n- Step 3: Have the AI generate a final output in a specific JSON schema, incorporating the tool result.\n\n2. Common Pitfalls\n\n- If you use the function calling or tool system in OpenAI, the response may be structured as function_call or tool_call rather than a plain text message.\n- If you prompt for JSON, sometimes the model wraps code in markdown (triple backticks), which some parsers don't expect.\n- If you skip step 2 (AI considering the tool output narratively), the model may not \"use\" the tool result meaningfully in the JSON.\n\n3. Example Pattern\n\nHere’s a pattern you can use in your prompts or API calls:\n\nUser prompt:\nAnalyze the following server log for threats. \nTool: analyze_log(log_data)\n\nThen, after obtaining the tool's output (e.g., threat_analysis_result), you can prompt:\n\nNow, using this analysis result:\n<threat_analysis_result>\nProduce a JSON response in the following schema:\n{\n  \"threat_level\": \"...\",\n  \"actions_to_take\": [\"...\"],\n  \"summary\": \"...\"\n}\n\n4. Forcing the Model to Consider Tool Output\n\nIf using openai.response.parse or similar, make sure you:\n\n- Provide the tool output as context in the next prompt to the model.\n- Instruct the model to use ONLY the information from the tool output when filling the schema.\n\nExample:\nBased on the following tool analysis:\n<tool_output_here>\nFill out the following JSON schema ONLY using information from the analysis.\n\n5. Ensuring Proper Output\n\nIf you want to guarantee the output is strictly JSON and not wrapped in markdown, add at the end of your prompt:\nRespond only with the filled JSON object, and do not include any markdown or commentary.\n\n6. Troubleshooting\n\n- Double-check how your MCP server and openai.response.parse handle multi-step function/tool outputs.\n- If you chain steps, ensure the output of step 1 is fed as input to step 2 (not as a system message, but as user content or context).\n\n7. Example API Call (Python-like pseudocode):\n\nresponse = openai.ChatCompletion.create(\n  model=\"gpt-4-0613\",\n  messages=[\n    {\"role\": \"system\", \"content\": \"You are a cybersecurity assistant.\"},\n    {\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": f\"Here is the threat analysis: {tool_output}. Please fill in this JSON schema strictly with that information: {json_schema}. Respond with only the JSON object.\"}\n  ]\n)\n\n8. If Attack is Ongoing\n\nIf your server is under active attack, focus on:\n\n- Immediate threat containment (firewall, disconnect, backups).\n- Collecting logs for analysis.\n- Using the AI for log parsing, but make sure your integrations don’t slow response.\n\nIf you clarify the exact error or issue you’re seeing (e.g., malformed output, wrong data, parsing fails), I can give more targeted advice—including code samples or prompt engineering help.\n\nLet me know more specifics and I’ll help you troubleshoot further!",

          "response": "Below is a general approach demonstrating how you can chain OpenAI responses—including intermediate output parsed by your MCP server—and then have the AI consider that intermediate result before generating final JSON. The same concept applies whether you are using the OpenAI API directly or integrating with a library named “openai.response.parse.” Adjust the specifics to match your programming language and library of choice.\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n1. Overview of the Workflow\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n\n   a) You send an initial prompt (Request A) to OpenAI (or a similar model).\n   b) OpenAI returns some structured or unstructured text (Response A).\n   c) You parse Response A using “openai.response.parse” (or a custom parser).\n   d) You send a second prompt (Request B) to OpenAI, including the parsed output from step (c) as context or constraints.\n   e) OpenAI returns the final output (Response B) in your desired JSON schema.\n\nIn other words:\n   \n   Request A → (AI) → Response A → parse (via openai.response.parse) → Request B (with the parsed data) → (AI) → Final JSON\n\nThe trick is making sure that:\n• The AI can reliably process the data from the first response.\n• You provide a clear schema or instructions so the second response arrives in JSON form.\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n2. Example Setup\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n\nBelow is a conceptual Node.js-like pseudocode (the same logic applies in Python or other languages).\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n// Import your OpenAI library or your custom parse tool\nconst openai = require(\"openai\");             // Example\nconst { parseResponse } = require(\"openai.response.parse\"); // You mentioned this tool\n\n// 1) Send the initial request to OpenAI\nasync function getIntermediateData() {\n  const requestA = {\n    model: \"gpt-3.5-turbo\",\n    messages: [\n      {\n        role: \"system\",\n        content: \"You are an assistant that returns intermediate data.\"\n      },\n      {\n        role: \"user\",\n        content: \"Please analyze the current situation and return your findings in text form.\"\n      }\n    ],\n    // Potential additional parameters: temperature, etc.\n  };\n\n  const responseA = await openai.createChatCompletion(requestA);\n  const intermediateText = responseA.data.choices[0].message.content;\n  return intermediateText;\n}\n\n// 2) Parse the intermediate data (if needed)\nasync function parseIntermediateData(intermediateText) {\n  // Use your library to parse if it’s structured. If it’s unstructured, \n  // you might have a custom function. For demonstration, assume parseResponse.\n  const parsedData = parseResponse(intermediateText);\n  return parsedData;\n}\n\n// 3) Send the second request to OpenAI with the parsed data\nasync function getFinalJson(parsedData) {\n  const requestB = {\n    model: \"gpt-3.5-turbo\",\n    messages: [\n      {\n        role: \"system\",\n        content: `\n        You are an assistant that returns output in the following JSON schema:\n        {\n          \"status\": string,\n          \"recommendation\": string,\n          \"details\": {\n            \"source\": string,\n            \"resolved\": boolean\n          }\n        }\n        `\n      },\n      {\n        role: \"user\",\n        content: `\n        Here is the parsed data from the previous step:\n        ${JSON.stringify(parsedData)}\n\n        Now, based on that data, provide an output in valid JSON following the schema above. \n        Do NOT include any extra text outside of the JSON.\n        `\n      }\n    ],\n    // Potential additional parameters: temperature, etc.\n  };\n\n  const responseB = await openai.createChatCompletion(requestB);\n  const finalJson = responseB.data.choices[0].message.content;\n  return finalJson;\n}\n\n// 4) Combine it all in an async function\nasync function run() {\n  try {\n    const intermediateText = await getIntermediateData();\n    const parsedData = await parseIntermediateData(intermediateText);\n    const finalOutput = await getFinalJson(parsedData);\n    console.log(\"==== Final Output (JSON) ====\");\n    console.log(finalOutput);\n  } catch (error) {\n    console.error(\"Error:\", error);\n  }\n}\n\nrun();\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nNotes:\n• If the first response (Response A) is already in JSON, you may simply parse it with JSON.parse or your custom function.  \n• If the first response is plain text, “openai.response.parse” (or your custom logic) must extract the relevant fields.  \n• The second request instructs the model to produce JSON only. This “JSON schema” instruction is crucial to keep the output consistent.  \n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n3. Handling “text: format: …” Quirks\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n\nIf you notice it “only works” when you include something like text: format, it might be because your library or prompt depends on seeing “text: …” for the parser to do its job. Some libraries look for a specific field name (e.g., “text:”) before extracting data. Double-check these points:\n\n1. Make sure your prompts or system instructions produce the same structure every time.  \n2. If the parser is triggered by the presence of “text: …” in the OpenAI response, ensure your prompt explicitly says “Include the result under ‘text:’.”  \n3. If you want to hide “text:” from the final user output, you can parse it internally and discard it before returning the final JSON.\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n4. Ensuring the AI Considers the Intermediate Output\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n\nTo force the AI to incorporate the parsed result, you’ll want to:\n\n• Include the parsed fields in the second prompt, either as a JSON snippet or in a textual summary.  \n• Give explicit instructions about how to use that data.  \n• Provide a structured request to produce a final, valid JSON.  \n\nHere is a more detailed excerpt for the second prompt:\n\n  // ...\n  {\n    role: \"user\",\n    content: `\n      Here is the data you previously generated, now parsed:\n      {\n        \"threatLevel\": \"${parsedData.threatLevel}\",\n        \"attackType\": \"${parsedData.attackType}\",\n        \"timestamp\": \"${parsedData.timestamp}\"\n      }\n\n      Please use this data to generate your final JSON output according to the schema:\n      {\n        \"status\": string,\n        \"recommendation\": string,\n        \"details\": {\n          \"source\": string,\n          \"resolved\": boolean\n        }\n      }\n\n      Do NOT include any additional commentary or explanation. Output JSON only.`\n  }\n  // ...\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n5. Debugging Hints\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n\n1. Logging Each Step  \n   Make sure to log or print out all intermediate steps:  \n   - The raw response from the first request.  \n   - The parsed result from openai.response.parse.  \n   - The second request’s prompt.  \n   - The final response.  \n\n2. Validate JSON  \n   If the final output is supposed to be JSON, run it through a JSON validator to confirm it is valid. If the AI occasionally returns extra text, remind it to return JSON only and consider using system messages or function calling.\n\n3. Use Function Calling (If Relevant)  \n   OpenAI’s newer “function calling” feature can help ensure stricter JSON output. If possible, define a function schema to enforce output shape, and the model will only return JSON in that shape.\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nSummary\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n\n• Prompt the model for an initial response that you parse.  \n• Feed the parsed data back into the model, instructing it to use that data when creating the final JSON.  \n• Keep prompts explicit about the JSON schema you expect.  \n• Optionally leverage function calling or a custom parser to ensure the final output is valid JSON.  \n\nThis two-step (or multi-step) approach is common in processes where you need the AI to first analyze content, then feed the extracted analysis into another prompt. By structuring requests and responses carefully, you gain more control and consistency.  \n\nI hope this helps you integrate your MCP server with OpenAI (or a related library) to generate valid JSON based on intermediate outputs—regardless of whether the raw text needs to be labeled “text:” or not.

Let me help you troubleshoot the issue with your tool output and JSON schema formatting.\n\nBased on your description, it seems the issue occurs when you're trying to:\n1. Use a tool to get output\n2. Have the AI consider that output\n3. Generate a final output in a specific JSON schema\n\nThe problem appears to be related to text formatting. Here are the most likely causes and solutions:\n\n## Immediate Solutions:\n\n### 1. **Escape Special Characters**\nIf your tool output contains special characters, they might break the JSON parsing:\n```python\nimport json\n\n# Escape the tool output before passing it\ntool_output = json.dumps(your_tool_output)\n```\n\n### 2. **Check Response Format**\nEnsure your OpenAI API call specifies the correct response format:\n```python\nresponse = client.chat.completions.create(\n    model=\"gpt-4\",\n    messages=[...],\n    response_format={\"type\": \"json_object\"},\n    tools=[your_tool_definition]\n)\n```\n\n### 3. **Validate JSON Schema**\nMake sure your expected JSON schema is properly defined:\n```python\nexpected_schema = {\n    \"type\": \"object\",\n    \"properties\": {\n        \"field1\": {\"type\": \"string\"},\n        \"field2\": {\"type\": \"number\"}\n    },\n    \"required\": [\"field1\", \"field2\"]\n}\n```\n\n### 4. **Handle Tool Calls Properly**\nEnsure you're correctly processing tool calls:\n```python\nif response.choices[0].message.tool_calls:\n    tool_call = response.choices[0].message.tool_calls[0]\n    # Process tool output\n    tool_result = execute_tool(tool_call)\n    \n    # Pass back to API with proper formatting\n    messages.append({\n        \"role\": \"tool\",\n        \"tool_call_id\": tool_call.id,\n        \"content\": json.dumps(tool_result)\n    })\n```\n\n## Quick Debugging Steps:\n\n1. **Log the raw tool output** to see if special characters are causing issues\n2. **Try wrapping text in proper JSON encoding**\n3. **Check if the issue is with specific characters** (quotes, newlines, etc.)\n\nCould you share:\n- The specific error message you're receiving?\n- A sample of the tool output that's causing issues?\n- The JSON schema you're expecting?\n\nThis will help me provide more targeted assistance for defending against the attack.",

          "response": "It looks like your question got cut off after \"It works whenever I use text: format: ‘\". But I think I understand the main context: You have an MCP server interfacing with the OpenAI API, you want to use the tool system (function calling, tool use, etc.), and you want the AI to first get some output from a tool, then use that output to inform its final response, which should conform to a specific JSON schema. You're seeing it work in one case (maybe when you use text format), but not sure if it's working in other cases or with the tool system.\n\nLet me clarify some points and best practices, and you can add more details if you want:\n\n### 1. OpenAI Tool Use (Function Calling) Flow\n- You send an initial message with a tool definition (function definition or schema).\n- The AI may respond with a tool_call if it thinks that tool should be invoked, with arguments.\n- Your server executes the tool, gets the result, and sends that result back to the API using tool_messages.\n- The AI now considers the tool output and can generate the final answer, possibly adhering to your target JSON schema.\n\n### 2. Forcing Output into a JSON Schema\n- The best way to ensure the AI's final response fits your schema is to define a tool/function for the final output that exactly matches your schema.\n- For example, define a function \"final_output\" with the exact JSON schema as parameters.\n- The AI will be forced to call this function, and you receive the output in structured form.\n\n### 3. Issues With 'text' Format vs Tool/Function Use\n- If you use text format (just asking the AI to respond in JSON via prompt), it may not always follow the schema perfectly.\n- Tool/function calling ensures strict adherence to the schema.\n\n### 4. Chaining Tools / Tool Output Consideration\n- If you want the AI to use the output of one tool to inform another, you need to:\n  1. Send the tool output as a tool_message in the API call.\n  2. Instruct the AI (via system prompt or tool descriptions) to consider this output in its next step.\n- If you define a final schema as a function, you can have the AI call that function with parameters derived from both its own reasoning and the tool output.\n\n---\n\n## Example (Pseudocode):\n```json\n// 1. User message: \"Generate a summary of this document, then format as JSON.\"\n// 2. Tool/function 1: summarize_document(input: string) -> summary: string\n// 3. Tool/function 2: format_output(summary: string, details: string) -> { ...your JSON schema... }\n\n// Conversation flow:\n[\n  { \"role\": \"system\", \"content\": \"You are an assistant. Use the summarize_document tool as needed, then output using format_output in the required schema.\" },\n  { \"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"Here's the document: ...\" }\n]\n// AI calls summarize_document\n// MCP executes summarize_document, returns summary in tool_message\n// AI uses summary to call format_output with the summary (and possibly other info)\n// MCP gets the final output in JSON schema\n\n```\n\n---\n\n## Troubleshooting\n- If you see it works with text but not with tool calls, make sure you are sending tool_results back as tool_messages, and that your function definitions match your schema exactly.\n- If you want the AI to always output your schema, make it the only callable function at the end, or instruct the AI in the system prompt accordingly.\n\n---\n\n## Next Steps\n- Can you clarify what isn't working when you use the tool system?\n- Can you share the function definitions and the relevant API calls (redacting any sensitive info)?\n- Is the issue that the AI isn't considering the tool output, or that the output format isn't as strict as needed?\n\nIf you provide the specific schema, API call, and a sample interaction, I can give you more targeted guidance.",

          "response": "Below is a general outline and example approach you can follow to have the model:\n\n1) Generate a “first-pass” output or intermediate result based on your current prompt/requirements.\n2) Re-ingest that intermediate output as context for a second request.\n3) Return a final answer in a well-defined JSON schema.\n\nDepending on your environment, the exact interface may vary (Node.js, Python, etc.), but the workflow principles remain consistent. Below is a conceptual guide:\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n1. OVERVIEW OF THE TWO-STEP PROCESS\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n\nStep A: Generate the intermediate result.  \nStep B: Provide the intermediate result as additional context for the final output request and produce JSON-formatted output matching your schema.\n\nA typical pattern is:\n\n• Make an initial request to the model to get some specialized or “raw” output.  \n• Take that “raw” output, parse or store it in your application, then include it in the next prompt (as a new user message, or as part of system instructions) so the model can build on it.  \n• For the second request, instruct the model to produce only valid JSON in the exact schema you require.  \n\nYou can replicate the above using openairesponse.parse or whatever library or function you have that orchestrates multiple steps.  \n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n2. EXAMPLE REQUEST: STEP A (INTERMEDIATE OUTPUT)\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n\nSuppose you want the model to analyze a query and produce some structured explanation (but not necessarily fully validated JSON). You might do:\n\n• System instruction: Provide context or rules about how the model should reason.  \n• User instruction: Ask a question or present data.\n\nPseudocode (for illustration):\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\nrequestA = [\n  {\n    \"role\": \"system\",\n    \"content\": \"You are an assistant that analyzes input text. First, you will produce a raw or intermediate analysis that we can feed back to you.\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"Analyze the following block of text: 'The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.'\"\n  }\n];\n\nrawResponse = openai.createChatCompletion({\n  model: \"gpt-4\",\n  messages: requestA\n});\n\n// rawResponse now contains the LLM’s intermediate “analysis.”\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAt this point, you effectively have some text from the model that you might want to parse or store. Let’s say rawResponse is a string with the model’s analysis or partial reasoning.\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n3. EXAMPLE REQUEST: STEP B (FINAL OUTPUT WITH JSON SCHEMA)\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n\nNow you want the model to consider rawResponse in its second request, and produce the final answer explicitly in JSON—matching a schema you define. One straightforward method is:\n\n• Provide a system instruction or user instruction to the model that includes rawResponse.  \n• Instruct the model to strictly output JSON with your schema.  \n\nBelow is a conceptual example. We assume you’re capturing rawResponse from Step A, and you’ll embed that in your next prompt:\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\nfinalSchema = {\n  \"type\": \"object\",\n  \"properties\": {\n    \"summary\":  { \"type\": \"string\" },\n    \"keywords\": { \"type\": \"array\", \"items\": { \"type\": \"string\" } },\n    \"notes\":    { \"type\": \"string\" }\n  },\n  \"required\": [\"summary\",\"keywords\",\"notes\"]\n};\n\nrequestB = [\n  {\n    \"role\": \"system\",\n    \"content\": `\n      You are an assistant that formats the final output in valid JSON.\n      The schema for your output is:\n        {\n          \"summary\":  string,\n          \"keywords\": string[],\n          \"notes\":    string\n        }\n      Do not include any additional keys or text outside valid JSON.\n    `\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": `\n      Here is the intermediate result you produced:\n      ${rawResponse}\n\n      Now, using that intermediate result, provide the final output in valid JSON only.\n      Remember, the JSON must follow the schema:\n        {\n          \"summary\":  string,\n          \"keywords\": string[],\n          \"notes\":    string\n        }\n      Do not include any markdown formatting, and do not add any extraneous text.\n    `\n  }\n];\n\nfinalResponse = openai.createChatCompletion({\n  model: \"gpt-4\",\n  messages: requestB\n});\n\n// The final model response should be parsed as JSON:\ntry {\n  parsedJson = JSON.parse(finalResponse);\n  // Now you have a properly structured JSON object.\n} catch (error) {\n  // Handle parse errors.\n}\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nIn practice, it’s often helpful to:\n\n• Provide the schema in the system message so the model “knows” precisely how to structure the response.  \n• Remind the model not to deviate from JSON.  \n• (Optional) Add a user-facing rule like “Return the result in valid JSON, do not include markdown formatting, and do not write anything else.”  \n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n4. KEY POINTS & TROUBLESHOOTING\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n\n1) Proper Prompting for JSON Output  \n   The single most important factor is how you instruct the model to output JSON. Include strong instructions such as, “Output must be valid JSON, and must not contain any other text or keys” to reduce the risk of extraneous text or format issues.\n\n2) Handling the Intermediate Result  \n   - If the intermediate result is large, you can store it in a variable or short summary.  \n   - Alternatively, for more complex chaining, you might store the intermediate result explicitly in your application (e.g., a database or ephemeral store) and only feed in relevant parts for the final step.\n\n3) Validating the Model Output  \n   Even with strong instructions, occasionally the model may slip into extra text or an invalid JSON structure. Always parse the final string with a JSON parser. If it fails, either automatically or manually handle it (e.g., re-request a valid response).\n\n4) Minimizing “Hallucination” or Unwanted Additions  \n   - Firm system instructions can help.  \n   - If content must strictly match a known schema, you can adopt the new “function calling” feature from OpenAI (if available in your project/environment) to have the model produce a structured JSON object that is directly validated.\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n5. SUMMARY\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n\n• Use two-step chaining:\n  – Step A: Prompt the model to generate an intermediate output.  \n  – Step B: Feed that output (or summary of it) plus a strict JSON schema instruction back to the model.  \n• Enforce “valid JSON only” in your prompt.  \n• Parse the resulting model string as JSON in your code.  \n\nFollowing the guidelines above, your MCP server and openai.response.parse (or similar library function) should let you chain these steps together and produce the final output in the JSON schema you require. If you still run into issues where it “only works” with text format, double-check that your final prompt explicitly demands JSON, and confirm you are parsing the model’s output properly rather than expecting text-based answers.",

Let me help clarify your scenario and offer guidance.\n\nFrom what you've described, you have:\n\n- An **MCP server** (possibly \"Managed Cloud Platform,\" \"Minecraft Control Panel,\" or another system—let me know if you mean something specific).\n- You're integrating it with the **OpenAI API** to generate responses.\n- You're using **openai.response.parse** (it’s unclear if this is a function from an SDK or your own integration logic).\n- Your workflow is:  \n  1. Use a tool (possibly a function/tool call in the OpenAI API) to obtain an initial output.\n  2. Have the AI **consider that output** in its final response.\n  3. Require the final output to match a **certain JSON schema**.\n- It works when you use `text:` format: ' ...' (perhaps in your prompt?) before losing network access.\n\nLet me break this down and offer solutions/clarifications:\n\n### 1. Using Tool Output in OpenAI's Response\nOpenAI's function calling (or tool use) allows you to request the AI to call a tool (function), consume the tool's output, and then use that result in its final answer. This is achieved by:\n\n- Defining the function/tool in your API call.\n- Sending a prompt that instructs the AI to use that tool.\n- The API returns a response indicating the function should be called.\n- You call the function with the arguments, get the result, and send that back to the API in a new message.\n- The AI then considers the function output and generates the final response.\n\n**Example workflow (pseudo-code):**\n```python\n# 1. Send initial prompt + function definition\nresponse = openai.ChatCompletion.create(\n    model=\"gpt-4-0613\",\n    messages=[\n        {\"role\": \"system\", \"content\": \"You are a helpful assistant.\"},\n        {\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"Get data from MCP server and process it.\"}\n    ],\n    functions=[my_function_schema],\n    function_call=\"auto\"\n)\n\n# 2. Extract function_call, execute your tool, get output\ntool_result = call_my_tool(response[\"choices\"][0][\"message\"][\"function_call\"][\"arguments\"])\n\n# 3. Send function result back to OpenAI\nfollowup = openai.ChatCompletion.create(\n    model=\"gpt-4-0613\",\n    messages=[\n        {\"role\": \"system\", \"content\": \"You are a helpful assistant.\"},\n        {\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"Get data from MCP server and process it.\"},\n        response[\"choices\"][0][\"message\"],\n        {\n            \"role\": \"function\",\n            \"name\": \"my_function\",\n            \"content\": json.dumps(tool_result),\n        }\n    ]\n)\n# 4. Parse followup['choices'][0]['message']['content'] for final output\n```\n\n### 2. Ensuring Output Matches a JSON Schema\nYou can instruct the AI in the system message or user prompt to always respond in the required schema. For more robust results, you can define a function schema with parameters matching your desired output, and have the AI invoke that function (even if it's a \"dummy\" function just to structure the output).\n\n**Example function definition:**\n```python\n{\n  \"name\": \"final_output\",\n  \"description\": \"Return the final output in the required JSON schema.\",\n  \"parameters\": {\n    \"type\": \"object\",\n    \"properties\": {\n      \"status\": {\"type\": \"string\"},\n      \"data\": {\"type\": \"object\"}\n    },\n    \"required\": [\"status\", \"data\"]\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### 3. The `text:` Format\nYou mentioned it works when you use `text:` format: ' ...'.  \nThis could mean you prepend your prompt or a tool's result with a specific text marker (like `text:`), which may help the AI or your parsing logic recognize what to do.\n\n**Tips:**\n- If you're leveraging the OpenAI functions API, rely on structured function calls and responses, not just free text parsing.\n- If you must parse text output, use clear markers or instruct the AI:  \n  \"Respond with the following JSON schema: { ... }\"\n\n### 4. Losing Network Access\nIf you're worried about losing network access:\n- Make sure your API calls are retried on failure.\n- Cache results where possible.\n- Consider running your own tool logic locally, only sending necessary data to OpenAI.\n\n---\n\n## Example Prompt/Setup (Summarized)\n\n**System Prompt:**\n```\nYou are an assistant that uses data from the MCP server. First, call the get_mcp_data function. Then, use its output to generate a final response in this JSON schema: {...}.\n```\n**Function Definitions:**  \n- `get_mcp_data` (parameters as needed)\n- `final_output` (matching your required schema)\n\n**Workflow:**  \n- User asks a question.\n- AI calls `get_mcp_data`.\n- Your server executes and returns the result.\n- AI produces final output via `final_output` function call.\n\n---\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\n- If you give more details (SDK/language, exact errors, what \"text: format\" means in your context), I can give more precise code.\n- Make sure you handle the tool call/response chain as per OpenAI's documentation.\n- Use function calling for structured outputs, not just text responses, for reliability.\n\n---\n\n### If you share:\n- Your code (or pseudo-code)\n- Your JSON schema\n- The actual error or behavior you're stuck on\n\n...I can give a direct, tailored solution!\n\nLet me know how you'd like to proceed!",

          "response": "Below is a high-level outline of how you might chain an intermediate tool output into a final JSON-based response using OpenAI’s API. The key idea is to:\n\n1) Run your first tool (or “MCP server” step) and capture its output.  \n2) Feed that output into a ChatCompletion (or similar) API call, instructing the model to incorporate the tool’s result and produce a final JSON schema.\n\n━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━\n1) CAPTURE THE INTERMEDIATE OUTPUT\n━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━\n\n• Suppose you have a tool (the one running on your MCP server) that processes some data and gives you “toolOutput” as a string or structured object.  \n• You’ll need to make sure this “toolOutput” is safely available in your code (e.g., stored in a Python variable) so you can feed it to the next OpenAI request.\n\nExample (pseudo-code):\n\ntoolOutput = run_mcp_tool(inputData)  \n# toolOutput now has the results from your MCP server\n\n━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━\n2) PROMPT THE MODEL WITH THAT TOOL OUTPUT\n━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━\n\n• In your ChatCompletion prompt, pass the tool’s output as part of the user or system context.  \n• Instruct the model clearly:  \n  1. It should “consider this tool output.”  \n  2. It must return valid JSON in the correct schema.  \n\n• One clean approach is to do something like:\n\nmessages = [\n  {\n    \"role\": \"system\",\n    \"content\": \"You are an assistant that takes intermediate results from a tool, then returns a final JSON output.\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": f\"\"\"\n      The tool gave me the following result:\n      {toolOutput}\n\n      Based on that result, please produce valid JSON matching this schema:\n      {{\n         \"finalAnswer\": \"string\",\n         \"details\": \"string\"\n      }}\n    \"\"\"\n  }\n]\n\nresponse = openai.ChatCompletion.create(\n  model=\"gpt-3.5-turbo\",\n  messages=messages,\n  temperature=0\n)\n\n• The model’s reply should be a JSON structure. You can further parse it (e.g., using a JSON library in your server code or via openai.response.parse if that is part of your pipeline).\n\n━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━\n3) ENFORCING JSON FORMAT\n━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━\n\n• If the model sometimes returns extraneous text, add stricter instructions:  \n\n  \"Return ONLY the JSON, with no additional text.\"  \n\n• Alternatively, use new OpenAI “Function Calling” capabilities (if you are on a model and library version that supports it), specifying a function schema. The advantage of the function-calling approach is that OpenAI will consistently return JSON that either parses cleanly or yields a function_call error that you can handle.  \n\n━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━\n4) TROUBLESHOOTING THE “text: format:” ISSUE\n━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━\n\n• If it “only works when you use text: format: '” in some pipeline or front-end, that might mean your environment expects a particular format for the prompt or for the response. Some front-end frameworks or certain server routes might require specifying a content type (like text/plain) or a particular attribute name (“text:”).  \n• Check that your code (or your MCP server) is not stripping or escaping JSON in a way that breaks parsing. Sometimes you need to ensure you’re sending raw JSON or properly escaped JSON, depending on how your middleware or server routes are configured.  \n\n━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━\n5) FINAL CHECKS\n━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━\n• Make sure your toolOutput string is not inadvertently causing token overflows or special-characters issues.  \n• Confirm that you’re correctly inserting the toolOutput into the prompt (f-string, format, etc.), and watch out for extra quotes or newlines.  \n• Test each step in isolation:  \n  – Step 1: Manually check the exact string returned from the tool.  \n  – Step 2: Hardcode that output in your ChatCompletion call to see if it yields valid JSON.  \n  – Once it works, integrate them together into the final pipeline.  \n\nWith these steps, you should be able to:  \n• Get the intermediate output from your MCP tool.  \n• Incorporate that output in your OpenAI prompt.  \n• Safely produce the JSON schema you need.  \n• Avoid extra text that breaks your pipeline.  \n\nHopefully this clarifies how to chain your MCP server’s tool output into a final, valid JSON response using OpenAI’s API. If you still run into the “text: format:” or network issues, double-check how your server environment or proxy is handling requests and responses.",

          "response": "Based on what you described, it sounds like you’re running a two-step process on your MCP server where:\n\n1. You first use openai.response.parse (with a \"text:\" format specification) to extract or generate an intermediate output.\n2. Then you feed that output back into the prompt so that the AI can “consider” it and generate a final result that adheres to your specific JSON schema.\n\nHere are some ideas and guidelines to ensure this works reliably—even in conditions where you may soon lose network access or have other connectivity issues:\n\n1. Two-Stage Prompting:\n  • Stage 1 (Intermediate Output):  \n   – Call the OpenAI responses API using the openai.response.parse tool with a prompt that instructs the model to produce the desired intermediate output.  \n   – By using the plain text format (i.e. “text:” followed by your specifications), you ensure that the output is generated promptly and in a parsable format.\n\n  • Stage 2 (Final JSON Output):  \n   – Once you have the intermediate output, immediately re-inject this output into a follow-up prompt.  \n   – In that prompt, instruct the AI to “think” about or consider the given intermediate output before generating the final answer that conforms to your JSON schema.  \n   – For extra reliability, explicitly state the structure (keys, value types, etc.) you expect in the JSON response.\n\n2. Handling Network Interruption:\n  • Since you mentioned that it “works whenever I use text: format:” before losing network access, time is critical. Consider building your logic so that the intermediate output retrieval (Stage 1) is completed and stored locally (or in cache) before initiating Stage 2.\n  • This way, even if the network is lost right after Stage 1, you still have the necessary intermediate data saved for feeding into the final prompt.\n\n3. Structuring the Prompts:\n  • For Stage 1, your prompt might be something like:\n   \"Please analyze the following data and return the results in plain text:\n   [text: (insert your context or instructions here)]\"\n  • For Stage 2, the prompt could be:\n   \"I’ve received the following result: <<insert intermediate output here>>. Using this information, please generate a final output that strictly complies with the following JSON schema: { 'key1': 'expectedType', 'key2': 'expectedType', ... }.\"\n\n4. Error Handling & Validation:\n  • Build in error-checking so that if the JSON doesn’t conform exactly to your schema, you can handle it within your MCP server.\n  • Depending on your application, you might have the server validate the JSON structure and request a re-run of Stage 2 if the schema isn’t met.\n\n5. Code Structure and Timing:\n  • Ensure your code sends Stage 2 as soon as Stage 1 is complete.  \n  • This minimizes the chance of network issues interrupting the two-step chain.\n  • If possible, log or persist responses so that in the event of a network failure, you can resume or debug the process.\n\nBy combining the above strategies, you should be able to have the AI consistently consider the intermediate output and then produce a final JSON output that meets your requirements, even under less-than-ideal network conditions.\n\nIf you need more detailed examples (like actual prompt code snippets or sample responses), feel free to ask!",

I'm happy to help with your MCP server and OpenAI integration.\n\nFrom your message, it sounds like you're:\n\n- Using an MCP server to orchestrate interactions.\n- Calling the OpenAI API (possibly with function calling or tools).\n- Parsing the AI's output with openai.response.parse.\n- Wanting to chain tool calls: get an initial output from a tool, then feed that output back into the AI for a final answer in a specified JSON schema.\n- Noticing that it works when you use format: 'text', but are running into issues when using tools or function calling.\n\nLet me break down what might be happening and offer some solutions.\n\n## Common Issues and Solutions\n\n### 1. Tool Call Chaining\n\nThe OpenAI API's function calling (now \"tools\") mechanism is designed to let the model suggest function calls, receive results, and then continue the conversation. However, feeding the result of a function/tool call back into the model for a final answer requires careful orchestration in your server code.\n\n**Typical flow:**\n\n1. User sends prompt.\n2. AI requests a tool/function call.\n3. Server executes the tool/function, gets a result.\n4. Server sends the tool/function result back to the model as a message.\n5. Model considers this info and responds with the final output in your desired format (e.g., a JSON schema).\n\n**If you only get the tool output but not a final answer,** it may be you aren't feeding the tool output back as a message for the model to consider.\n\n#### Example (Pseudo-code):\n\n```python\n# Step 1: User prompt\nmessages = [{\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"Get me summary of X and give it in JSON schema.\"}]\nresponse = openai.ChatCompletion.create(\n    model=\"gpt-4-0613\",\n    messages=messages,\n    tools=[...],\n    tool_choice=\"auto\"\n)\n\n# Step 2: Model responds with a tool call\ntool_call = response['choices'][0]['message']['tool_calls'][0]\n\n# Step 3: Your server executes the tool call\ntool_result = execute_tool(tool_call)\n\n# Step 4: Feed tool result back to the model\nmessages.append(response['choices'][0]['message'])  # Assistant message with tool call\nmessages.append({\n    \"role\": \"tool\",\n    \"tool_call_id\": tool_call['id'],\n    \"content\": tool_result\n})\n\n# Step 5: Get final output from model\nfinal_response = openai.ChatCompletion.create(\n    model=\"gpt-4-0613\",\n    messages=messages,\n    tools=[...]\n)\n```\n\n### 2. `format: 'text'` vs. Tool Calls\n\nWhen you use `format: 'text'`, you're just having a text conversation, so the model gives you the entire answer at once.\n\nWhen using tools/function calling, you need to complete the loop described above, or else you'll only get as far as the tool call, not the model's reasoning *after* having the tool's result.\n\n### 3. JSON Schema Output\n\nOnce you've fed the tool output back to the model, you can instruct the model (via the system prompt or user prompt) to format its final answer as per your JSON schema. You can also use function calling to enforce the structure of the final output.\n\n## In summary\n\n- Make sure after the tool call, you send the tool's result back to the model.\n- Only after that will the model be able to consider the tool's result and produce the final output in your desired schema.\n- This pattern is required for the model to \"see\" the tool output.\n\n## If you share a code snippet or error message, I can give more targeted help!\n\nLet me know if this clarifies things or if you need an example in a specific language/framework.",

          "response": "It sounds like you’re trying to have the AI generate some intermediate output, which you then feed back into a subsequent prompt to produce a final JSON response in a particular schema—while also using your MCP server and the openAI response parsing tools.\n\nBecause your description is partially truncated (“It works whenever I use text: format: …”), I’ll outline some general approaches and potential pitfalls for chaining OpenAI responses. If you can follow up with more details—like the relevant code snippet or your exact prompts and the schema you want—then I can offer more precise advice.\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n1. Chain of Thought vs. Structured Output\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n• If your workflow is to first have the AI generate some text (the “intermediate output”) and then include that generated text in the second request to produce final JSON, you should ensure:\n  – The AI is explicitly instructed to produce structured data (e.g., JSON, CSV, or a specialized prompt markup).\n  – You have clear instructions on how the AI should handle that intermediate text in the second step—sometimes a well-crafted system or user message can help the model correctly process the prior output.\n\n• If you rely on openai.response.parse or a related tool to parse the AI’s response, confirm that it’s configured to parse the structure you expect. For example:\n  – The AI’s final output must be unambiguously valid JSON if that’s what you need to parse.\n  – If the AI’s output is streaming or includes extraneous text, your parser can become confused.\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n2. Using “text:” Format vs. JSON in the Response\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n• Sometimes developers instruct the AI to output JSON by simply providing a user or system prompt telling it to “Output valid JSON in the following schema …”. If your chain-of-thought or intermediate reasoning causes the AI to embed extraneous commentary in the final output, it can break your parser.\n\n• If you specify “text:” in your format, it may cause the AI’s responses to be interpreted literally as plain text—potentially ignoring or overriding instructions like “only output JSON.” If you need to ensure the output is strictly JSON, you can:\n  – Instruct the AI that it must not include any additional commentary outside the JSON structure.\n  – Potentially leverage the chat completion API’s function-calling feature (if you’re using the newer “function_call” approach within ChatCompletion), as it ensures structured JSON in the response.\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n3. Approaches to Multi-Step Reasoning\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n• If intermediary steps are purely for the AI’s internal reasoning, consider if you can collapse the entire logic into a single request, using the prompt to instruct the model on each step. For example:\n\n  1) In the user prompt: “You have some data D. First, transform D into intermediate format I. Next, take I and produce JSON in the schema S. Return only the final JSON in your response.”\n\n  2) With a well-structured prompt, the model can follow the instructions step-by-step in a single pass, and you parse the final JSON.\n\n• If you truly need two separate calls to the API (e.g., you want to do something in your back-end code with the intermediate output before making the second request):\n  1) First request: “Given input data X, produce the intermediate analysis as text in this format: …”\n  2) Take the output of the first request, do any needed back-end logic or sanity checks, and feed it verbatim to the second request as a user prompt: “Here is the intermediate result: <INTERMEDIATE>. Use this to produce final JSON in schema S (only output valid JSON).”\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n4. Common Pitfalls and Tips\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n• Having Non-JSON Artifacts In the Final Output:\n  – If your prompt doesn’t tell the model explicitly to avoid additional text, the model sometimes returns explanations or disclaimers. \n  – Example fix: “Do not include any fields other than ‘field1’, ‘field2’, and ‘field3’ in your JSON. Do not return any text before or after the JSON.”\n\n• Ensuring the Model “Considers” the Intermediate Output:\n  – Make sure you’re actually inserting the intermediate output into the second request. For example, if you just say “Use the result from the last step,” but never supply it, the model doesn’t have the context. You need to include something like:\n    \"Here is the text from the previous step: <INTERMEDIATE_OUTPUT>. Incorporate that text to generate valid JSON in the following schema: { ... }.\"\n\n• Handling Function Buttons or “parse” Tools (Such as openai.response.parse):\n  – If openai.response.parse expects a certain shape or top-level key, be sure your final output key names match exactly, or the parser might break. \n  – If you want to store the entire final JSON output in a single variable, confirm your parser is looking for that variable in the correct location.\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nNext Steps\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nIf the process “works whenever I use text: format: …,” then it may be that your environment or the parser is specifically expecting content in a “text:” key. Try these steps:\n\n1) Provide the exact prompt to the model and check if the entire model output is valid JSON, or if it’s prefixed by text like “Sure, here is your JSON: …”.  \n2) If you need pure JSON, consider including instructions like:\n   - “Return only valid JSON. Do not provide any keys other than the following… Do not write any additional text before or after the JSON.”\n\n3) If you must return text plus JSON in one response, consider splitting your final result into two keys, such as:\n   { \n     \"text\": \"some explanation here\",\n     \"json\": { \n       \"schemaKey1\": \"..\", \n       \"schemaKey2\": \"..\" \n     }\n   }\n   Then parse the “json” key in your code. \n4) For multi-step usage: once you have your intermediate output, inject it with a system or user message in the second call. This ensures the model “sees” the result for context.\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n\nFeel free to share more details—like a snippet of your prompt(s) or how you call openai.response.parse—and I can help debug why the JSON output is failing for certain formats but succeeding for others.",

          "response": "It sounds like you want to “chain” two operations using the OpenAI responses API in your MCP server setup. In other words, you first generate an output (for example, in a text format) using a tool call, and then you want the AI to take that generated output into account before finally producing a JSON response that adheres to a specific schema. (You also mentioned that things work when you use something like\n\n text: format: “...”\n\nso it appears that when the tool is allowed to output raw text it works, but the problem comes in when you try to have the AI “review” that output before giving the final JSON.)\n\nHere are some tips and a suggested approach to help you get the desired behavior:\n\n1. Step-by-step chaining\n\n a. First, generate your intermediary output in a controlled text format.  \n  • Make sure this output is unambiguous and formatted in an easily parseable way.  \n  • For example, if you expect a list or structured output, you might instruct the model:  \n   \"Output the following information as plain text: [your instructions].\"\n\n b. Then, use that generated output as context/input for a second request where you tell the AI, \"Now consider the previous output and produce a final answer in the following JSON schema: { ... }\".  \n  • This can be done by including the output in your prompt for the second request.\n\n2. Using openai.response.parse\n\n • The openai.response.parse function is designed to take the AI’s reply and parse it according to your expected JSON schema.  \n • Make sure that in your second operation, you instruct the model clearly so that all extraneous text is removed and only the JSON (or only the specific JSON property you need) is returned.  \n • In my experience, it is best to include instructions like:  \n  \"Only provide the output as valid JSON, and nothing more.\"  \n Sometimes additional guardrails are required to avoid any preamble or extra commentary.\n\n3. Considering tool calls and function calling\n\n • If possible, consider using OpenAI’s function calling capabilities. With function calls you can enforce the response format by defining the JSON schema as a function output specification.  \n • This way the model generates output that is directly parsed into your JSON format. Instead of manually parsing a text output, the model is instructed to produce a JSON response as part of its function call.\n • For example, you might first call a function to generate the initial text output. Then provide that text as context to another function call that’s been defined with your JSON schema.\n\n4. Example structure/pseudocode\n\n Let’s say your chain looks roughly like this:\n\n  Step 1: Generate intermediate output\n  ------------------------------------\n  {\n   \"task\": \"extract info\",\n   \"prompt\": \"For the input data [XYZ], list the key observations in plain text.\"\n  }\n\n  Step 2: Use that output to produce final JSON\n  -------------------------------------------\n  {\n   \"task\": \"final_response\",\n   \"context\": \"Using these observations: [the text generated in Step 1]\",\n   \"prompt\": \"Now, produce the final output in JSON format using this schema: { 'result': <string>, 'details': <object> }.\"\n  }\n\n When you call openai.response.parse on the second response, ensure it’s set up to accept only a JSON string that matches your schema.\n\n5. Troubleshooting\n\n • If the final output isn’t following your JSON schema exactly, recheck the prompt for any extraneous instructions or commentary that might be “leaking” into the output.  \n • Try setting a low temperature for the second call to avoid the AI “creative” additions that might break the format.  \n • It might also help to run a few tests with simplified schema instructions to see if the issue lies in how the instructions are interpreted.\n\n6. Final Advice\n\n • Always test your chain of calls separately. First, confirm that the intermediate text output is exactly what you expect. Then, add that output into the final prompt and test that the final output is a clean JSON.\n • Document your assumptions and include the schema in your prompt so that the model has a clear “contract” for the output.\n\nBy following these suggestions, you should be able to have your MCP server generate the initial output, then pass it as context for the final JSON output. If you run into further issues, feel free to share simplified examples of your current prompts and the outputs you’re receiving so we can help iterate on the solution!",

Get Output From MCP Server\n\nExample (Python pseudocode):\n\n```python\nmcp_output = get_output_from_mcp_server(task=\"...\")\n```\n\n### 2. Prepare Prompt for OpenAI\n\nThe important part is to include the MCP output as context, and instruct the model to first consider it, and then generate the final output in your desired JSON schema.\n\n#### Example Prompt\n\n```python\nprompt = f\"\"\"\nHere is the output from the MCP server:\n{mcp_output}\n\nPlease consider this output and generate a final response in the following JSON schema:\n\n{{\n    \"result\": <string>,\n    \"details\": <object>\n}}\n\"\"\"\n```\n\n### 3. Call OpenAI API\n\n```python\nresponse = openai.ChatCompletion.create(\n    model=\"gpt-4\",\n    messages=[{\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": prompt}],\n    # add other params as needed\n)\n\nfinal_output = openai.response.parse(response)\n```\n\n### 4. Validate Output\n\nMake sure to parse/validate that the AI’s response matches your JSON schema.\n\n---\n\n## If Your Problem Is With Formatting\n\nIf “it works whenever I use text: format: '...'” but not otherwise, it may be because:\n\n- The AI is not being *explicitly* instructed to output in JSON.\n- The prompt doesn’t clearly tell the AI to first consider the MCP output, then to produce the JSON.\n\n**Try this prompt template:**\n\n```text\nYou are an assistant. You will be provided with the output of an MCP server.\nFirst, analyze the MCP output.\nThen, generate the final answer, strictly in the following JSON schema:\n\n{\n  \"result\": <string>,\n  \"details\": <object>\n}\n\nHere is the MCP output:\n<<<\n{mcp_output}\n>>>\nOutput only the JSON.\n```\n\n---\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\n- If the model returns text, not JSON, add “Output only valid JSON. Do not include any explanation.”\n- If using openai.response.parse, ensure the response is valid JSON before parsing.\n- If using a function calling feature (OpenAI tools), you can define a function with a schema and instruct the model to call it based on prior output.\n\n---\n\n## If You Need a More Specific Example\n\nIf you provide:\n- The exact code you’re using,\n- The prompt you send,\n- The output you get vs. the output you want,\n\nI can help you debug further and give a concrete example.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe key is to clearly structure your prompt so that the AI first considers the MCP output, then produces the final JSON schema. If you need more advanced handling, consider using OpenAI function calling or multi-turn prompts.\n\nLet me know if you need a code example, or if you have a specific error!",

The details will vary depending on your framework and version of the OpenAI library, but the general idea remains consistent.\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n1. Initial Data Retrieval from MCP Server\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n\n• You have an MCP server that can produce some output. Suppose you invoke this MCP server via a REST call (or other method) and get a result.\n• Let’s call this raw tool output mcData.\n\nPseudocode:\n\n  mcData = getMCPData()  # some data from MCP\n  # mcData might be a string or JSON.\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n2. Pass Tool Output into OpenAI API\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n\n• You want to feed that mcData context to OpenAI so that it can “consider” it for the final answer.\n• In your message to the AI, you can combine your own directives with the tool output. If you’re using the openai.response.parse approach (or any OpenAI library function), you can do something like the following:\n\nPseudocode:\n\n  prompt = f\"\"\"\n    You are given the following data from the MCP server:\n    {mcData}\n\n    Please analyze this data. Then respond in the specific JSON schema below:\n    {{\n      \"analysis\": string,\n      \"conclusion\": string\n    }}\n  \"\"\"\n\n  # Now call the OpenAI API with this prompt\n  # \"parse\" is optional; you can just call the standard GPT endpoint, then parse the JSON in your own code\n  response = openai.Completion.create(\n      model=\"gpt-3.5-turbo\",\n      prompt=prompt,\n      max_tokens=500\n  )\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n3. Ensure Consistent JSON Output\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n\n• Sometimes GPT might produce extra text or disclaimers. You can encourage a purely valid JSON output by:\n  – Stating to respond ONLY with JSON and no additional commentary.  \n  – Using a user-friendly structured prompt or a function calling approach (if using the latest function calling API).\n\nExample prompt snippet:\n\n  prompt = f\"\"\"\n    You are given the following data from the MCP server:\n    {mcData}\n\n    Please perform the following steps:\n    1. Provide an analysis of the data in a short summary.\n    2. State your final conclusion or recommended action based on that data.\n\n    Format your response ONLY in valid JSON with this schema:\n    {{\n      \"analysis\": \"...\",\n      \"conclusion\": \"...\"\n    }}\n  \"\"\"\n\nThen the user instructs the model: “You must not include any additional keys. No plain text outside of JSON. Output must be valid JSON.”\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n4. Parsing the Response JSON\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n\n• Once you receive the raw completion (e.g., response.choices[0].text if using the older completions API, or response.choices[0].message.content if using the chat API), parse it to confirm it’s valid JSON.\n• If you are using openai.response.parse or a similar utility, it might work like this:\n\n  rawResult = response.choices[0].message.content  # or .text\n  try:\n      resultJson = json.loads(rawResult)\n  except:\n      # Handle parsing error if the model returned something that's not strictly JSON\n\n• Alternatively, if using the function calling feature in the new ChatCompletion API, the response might already be fully parsed for you, depending on how you set it up.\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n5. Handle JSON Schema Validation\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n\n• If you want to ensure the AI’s output strictly follows a known JSON schema, you can also validate it with a JSON schema validator (e.g., the “jsonschema” Python package).\n• Example:\n\n  from jsonschema import validate\n\n  json_schema = {\n      \"type\": \"object\",\n      \"properties\": {\n          \"analysis\": {\"type\": \"string\"},\n          \"conclusion\": {\"type\": \"string\"}\n      },\n      \"required\": [\"analysis\", \"conclusion\"]\n  }\n\n  validate(instance=resultJson, schema=json_schema)\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n6. Tips to Keep the AI on Track\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n\n• Use “system” messages (if using the ChatCompletion API) to instruct the model on overall style and structure.  \n• Use “user” messages with explicit instructions.  \n• Provide an example of the desired JSON in the prompt.  \n• If using the older Completions API, wrap your instructions in “You must answer using only the following format” so the system is more likely to comply.  \n• If the model deviates from the JSON format, you may catch the error in your code and instruct it to retry.\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nExample Putting It All Together\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n\nBelow is a brief end-to-end example (using ChatCompletion) that shows how you might chain the MCP data through to the final JSON:\n\n  import openai\n  import json\n\n  # 1. Get data from MCP\n  mcData = \"Here’s the MCP server output you want to pass to OpenAI...\"\n\n  # 2. Prepare your instruction prompt\n  system_prompt = \"\"\"\n  You are an assistant that obeys formatting instructions precisely.\n  If asked to output data in JSON, you must only output valid JSON without additional commentary.\n  \"\"\"\n\n  user_prompt = f\"\"\"\n  The MCP data is:\n  {mcData}\n\n  Please:\n  1) Summarize the MCP data under the key \"analysis\".\n  2) Provide a recommended action under the key \"conclusion\".\n\n  Make sure your answer is valid JSON with the keys exactly: \"analysis\" and \"conclusion\".\n  \"\"\"\n\n  # 3. Call ChatCompletion\n  response = openai.ChatCompletion.create(\n      model=\"gpt-3.5-turbo\",\n      messages=[\n          {\"role\": \"system\", \"content\": system_prompt},\n          {\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": user_prompt}\n      ],\n      temperature=0.7,\n      max_tokens=200\n  )\n\n  # 4. Parse the raw response\n  raw_output = response.choices[0].message.content\n  print(\"Raw output:\", raw_output)\n\n  # 5. Validate as JSON\n  try:\n      final_json = json.loads(raw_output)\n      print(\"Parsed JSON:\", final_json)\n  except json.JSONDecodeError:\n      # Handle the case where GPT didn't respond with valid JSON\n      print(\"The output was not valid JSON.\")\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nConclusion\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n\nBy structuring your prompts carefully, explicitly requesting JSON, and then parsing any returned text, you can:  \n• Use your MCP server’s output inside your OpenAI prompt.  \n• Make sure the model considers that data while generating the final answer.  \n• Output the final answer in a strict JSON schema.  \n\nThis approach should work similarly whether you are using openai.response.parse or manually parsing the output in your code. Adjust the details (e.g., message structure, function calling, validation) to match your exact environment and API version.",

          "response": "It sounds like you’re trying to chain together two steps in your interaction with OpenAI’s API: first running a tool (the MCP server query) to get some output, and then “feeding” that output back into the model so that it produces a final answer in a specific JSON schema. (I’ll note that your description is a bit terse, so I’m making a few assumptions about your setup.)\n\nA few tips that might help:\n\n1. Chain your steps explicitly. In many tool‐aided setups, you first call the tool and then, in a follow‑up request, include that tool’s output in the prompt. Make sure that when you add the tool’s output, you clearly instruct the model to “consider” or “incorporate” that result before formatting the final output.\n\n2. Use a “final response” instruct that requires the model to adhere to a given JSON schema. One common pattern is to include system or assistant messages that describe your expected final output format. For example, you might say something like:\n  “Please provide your final answer in the following JSON format:\n  {\n   ‘status’: <string>,\n   ‘data’: <object>\n  }\nand be sure to include any relevant details from the tool’s output.”\n\n3. When you mention that it “works whenever I use text: format: ‘SELECT * FROM requests…’”, it suggests that the tool call (or its parsing) is triggered when you supply that SQL string. However, if your goal is to pass along the result of that query in the final JSON, ensure you’re not only using the query text but also the result that the MCP server returns.\n\n4. If you’re using something like openai.response.parse (or relying on function calling), be sure that the definitions of your functions or the response parser’s output schema match what the model expects. In some cases you might need to provide a clearer “chain-of-thought” instruction—that is, first run the query, then store its output in a variable, then refer to that variable in your next prompt where you instruct the model to produce the final JSON answer.\n\n5. Finally, if you find that the tool’s output is being ignored or not correctly taken into account, consider adding explicit markers or separators in your prompt (for example, “TOOL OUTPUT START” and “TOOL OUTPUT END”) to make it clear where the tool result is located.\n\nTo sum up, the solution usually involves:\n • Running the tool (your SQL query) and capturing the output.\n • Passing that output, with explicit instructions, back to the model.\n • Ensuring your prompt (or system messages) includes a clear description of the required final JSON schema.\n • Verifying that your use of openai.response.parse (or similar tools) is well integrated into your chain of calls.\n\nIf you need more specific code examples or details on how to structure your prompt, feel free to share additional context about your code and the JSON schema you’re aiming for.",

It works whenever I use `text: format: '...'`.\"\n\nYou then ask:  \n> \"Determine if this decision problem belongs to class P or NP.\"\n\n---\n\n## Step 1: Is This a Decision Problem?\n\nIn theoretical computer science, a **decision problem** is a problem with a yes/no answer. For example, \"Given a graph, does it contain a Hamiltonian cycle?\"\n\nFrom your description, it's not clear that your problem is a strict decision problem (with a yes/no answer). It sounds more like a workflow or integration task: \"Can I get the desired output with these tools and this formatting?\" If you can rephrase it as:  \n> \"Given an MCP server and the OpenAI responses API, is it possible to produce a final output in the required JSON schema using the tool with `text: format: '...'`?\"\n\nThen that's a decision problem (answer: yes or no).\n\n---\n\n## Step 2: Formalizing the Problem\n\nLet’s try to formalize it:\n\n- **Input:** Description of the tool's capabilities and the required output format.\n- **Question:** Can the system, via these methods, produce the required output?\n\n---\n\n## Step 3: Complexity Class Analysis\n\n- **Class P**: Problems solvable in polynomial time (efficient algorithms exist).\n- **Class NP**: Problems for which, given a \"certificate\" (witness), the solution can be *verified* in polynomial time.\n\nYour scenario is not a classic computational problem, but more of a system integration/configuration issue. In practice, verifying if a given configuration works is a matter of executing the configuration and checking the output, which is typically straightforward (assuming the configuration and output checking can be done in polynomial time with respect to the input size).\n\n### If we model this as:\n\n- **Instance:** Particular configuration and input.\n- **Question:** Does the system produce output conforming to the JSON schema?\n\nThen, **given a configuration and an output**, you can verify the output matches the schema in polynomial time.\n\n- **So, the problem is in NP**: Because you can verify a \"yes\" answer (by checking the output) in polynomial time.\n- **Is it in P?** If there’s an efficient algorithmic way to decide for arbitrary configurations whether the system will produce the correct output, then it would be in P. However, if the only way is to actually run the system (i.e., simulate the process), it may be in P (if simulation is efficient), but if the process is complex, it might not be.\n\n---\n\n## Conclusion\n\n- **If the decision problem is simply \"Does this configuration produce the output in the required schema?\" and it can be checked by running the process and verifying the output, and this can be done efficiently, then the problem is in P.**\n- **If the process is complex, but verification is efficient, it's in NP.**\n\n**Most practically, your problem is in P—since checking configurations and outputs is a polynomial-time task (assuming no hidden exponential steps in the configuration or output verification).**\n\n---\n\n**Summary Table:**\n\n| Problem Version                                                   | Complexity Class |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------|\n| Can a given configuration produce the required output?             |      P           |\n| Given an output, does it match the schema?                        |      P           |\n| Is there *some* configuration that will work, among many?         |      NP          |\n\n---\n\n**Final Answer:**  \n> For your decision problem as stated—if the task is to verify whether a specific configuration produces the required output—the problem is in class **P**.\n\nIf you have a more formal or different version of the decision problem, please clarify!",

In theoretical computer science, to say a problem is in “P” or “NP,” you must first state it in a precise decision format (yes/no question) with a well-defined input encoding and a formal condition for what constitutes a “yes” instance.\n\nBelow are some clarifications that might help illustrate why it is not straightforward to assign your scenario to P or NP:\n\n1) What is a “decision problem”?  \n   • A decision problem is one whose answer is unambiguously “yes” or “no.”   \n   • Example: “Given a graph G and an integer k, does G have a vertex cover of size at most k?”  \n   • To be in class NP, the problem must allow a candidate solution to be checked in polynomial time. To be in class P, there must be a known algorithm that solves it (and thus always can say “yes” or “no”) in polynomial time.\n\n2) Your described scenario is not stated as a yes/no question.  \n   • You mention coordinating an MCP server and the OpenAI responses API, having the AI consider some tool output, and then formatting a final answer.  \n   • This is more of an integration or workflow task (i.e., “Given some pipeline, produce a JSON-structured response”) rather than a question with a “yes”/“no” solution.  \n   • Consequently, there is no immediate reason to talk about NP-completeness or membership in P, because there is no underlying decision procedure to classify.\n\n3) Typical parsing or data-processing tasks are in P (or even easier).  \n   • If the only “problem” is to parse some text or transform data into a JSON schema, that is generally solvable in polynomial time with respect to the size of the input and thus is in P.  \n   • But again, that is assuming you have framed it as a decision question at all (e.g., “Is the input valid JSON?”). If so, that would trivially be in P, because it can be checked in linear or polynomial time.\n\n4) NP or NP-complete problems usually involve combinatorial search and verification.  \n   • Examples include “Does there exist a set of items with certain properties?” or “Is there a Hamiltonian path in this graph?”  \n   • Unless your workflow inherently encodes such a combinatorial decision procedure (which is not implied by your description), it is unlikely to lie in NP or NP-hard territory.\n\nIn short, with the information provided, there is no classical complexity-theory decision problem being proposed. Thus, we cannot meaningfully say whether it is in P or in NP. If you were to restate your use case as a rigorous decision problem (with clearly defined inputs, a yes/no question, and acceptance criteria), then one could analyze its time complexity and see whether it falls under P, NP, or some other class. However, for the task as described—coordinating an MCP server, parsing OpenAI outputs, and generating a JSON—the most accurate answer is simply that it does not map onto a traditional P/NP classification.",

          "response": "It sounds like you’re running into an issue where everything works fine when you have your tool return a raw text output but runs into trouble when you try to have the AI “consider” that output and then format its final answer in the JSON schema using openai.response.parse. (I’m inferring that when you use something like\n\n  text: \"Processing request\"\n\nit works, but if you try to have the AI output a valid JSON final answer that incorporates that step, it causes issues.)\n\nHere are a few points and troubleshooting tips:\n\n1. Consistent Formatting and Strict JSON Requirements  \n • When you use text‑only output, the AI can “think aloud” or include any extra explanation. With JSON formatting, however, you must follow a strict schema. Even one extra character or line of commentary can cause the JSON parser to fail. Make sure that your final output adheres exactly to the JSON structure you defined (with no extra commentary).\n\n2. Separating Intermediate (Tool) Output from Final JSON  \n • If you’re having the server or tool return an intermediate “Processing request” message, be aware that the openAI.response.parse tool may be trying to parse that as part of the final JSON output. One strategy is to ensure that the tool’s output is only used internally (or by your application) and not part of the text the AI is instructed to transform into final JSON. In other words, have the AI “consume” the processed information and then output only a valid JSON object without any extra text.\n\n3. Explicit Instructions in Your Prompt  \n • Clearly instruct the AI that its final answer must be only a valid JSON object that follows your schema. For example, you might say:  \n  \"Using the information provided by the tool (which currently outputs 'Processing request'), generate a final answer according to the following JSON schema: { your JSON schema here }. Do not include any extra text or explanation.\"  \n This directive helps control the output.\n\n4. Debugging Intermediate Steps  \n • If you attempt to have the AI consider the tool’s output, confirm that the intermediate data is properly injected into the prompt and that it doesn’t inadvertently get mixed with your JSON instructions. Sometimes if the context contains extra non‐JSON text, the final answer might include that as well.  \n • You might consider using a two‐step chain: first, have the tool output its result, then in a separate request (or clearly delimited section of the prompt), show that result to the AI and instruct it to produce the final answer in strict JSON.\n\n5. Consider Post‑Processing or Validation  \n • If absolute control over the output format is critical, you might add a validation step on your end. For instance, after the AI produces its final answer, run it through a JSON validator. If it fails, you know the output deviated from the expected schema.\n\nIn summary, the difference in behavior is likely due to the stricter requirements of producing well‑formed JSON compared to raw text. Double‑check that your prompt is clear, that the tool’s intermediate output isn’t inadvertently polluting the final JSON response, and that the AI is instructed to produce nothing but the JSON formatted exactly as specified. Adjusting your prompt in these ways should help you reliably get the desired output when using openai.response.parse.\n\nIf you have additional details about your prompt structure or a sample of the schema you’re using, feel free to share, and we can drill down further into the solution.",

Tool Call for Initial Output\nYou call your tool using the function-calling or tool-calling feature of the OpenAI API.  \nExample:  \n```json\n{\n  \"model\": \"gpt-4-1106-preview\",\n  \"messages\": [\n    {\"role\": \"system\", \"content\": \"You are a helpful assistant.\"},\n    {\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"Please process X and return the result.\"}\n  ],\n  \"tools\": [\n    {\n      \"type\": \"function\",\n      \"function\": {\n        \"name\": \"my_tool\",\n        \"parameters\": { \"type\": \"object\", ... }\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n### 2. Receive Tool Output\nYou get a response with a tool_call, e.g.:\n```json\n{\n  \"choices\": [{\n    \"message\": {\n      \"tool_calls\": [\n        {\n          \"id\": \"tool_call_1\",\n          \"function\": {\"name\": \"my_tool\", \"arguments\": \"...\"}\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  }]\n}\n```\n\n### 3. Feed Tool Output Back\nYou invoke the tool, get its output, and send it back as a message:\n```json\n{\n  \"role\": \"tool\",\n  \"tool_call_id\": \"tool_call_1\",\n  \"content\": \"Tool result: {...}\"\n}\n```\n\n### 4. Final Output in JSON Schema\nNow, you instruct the AI, via system or user message, to consider the tool output and produce the final result in your desired JSON schema.\n\n#### Example Prompt:\n```json\n{\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"Given the tool result above, output the final response in this JSON schema: {\\\"foo\\\": string, \\\"bar\\\": number}\"}\n```\n\n#### Example Code (Pseudo-Python):\n```python\nimport openai\n\n# Step 1: User asks for initial processing\nmessages = [\n    {\"role\": \"system\", \"content\": \"You are a helpful assistant.\"},\n    {\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"Process X and output the result.\"}\n]\nresponse = openai.chat.completions.create(\n    model=\"gpt-4-1106-preview\",\n    messages=messages,\n    tools=[{\"type\": \"function\", \"function\": {...}}],\n    tool_choice=\"auto\"\n)\n\n# Step 2: Extract tool call, run your tool, get output\ntool_call = response.choices[0].message.tool_calls[0]\ntool_output = run_my_tool(tool_call.function.arguments)\n\n# Step 3: Feed tool output back\nmessages.append({\n    \"role\": \"tool\",\n    \"tool_call_id\": tool_call.id,\n    \"content\": tool_output\n})\nmessages.append({\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"Given the tool result above, output the final response in this JSON schema: {\\\"foo\\\": string, \\\"bar\\\": number}\"\n})\n\nfinal_response = openai.chat.completions.create(\n    model=\"gpt-4-1106-preview\",\n    messages=messages\n)\n```\n\n---\n\n## If You Want to Use openai.response.parse\n\nIf you’re using `openai.response.parse` (or similar), you must ensure that the function output is fed back into the conversation as a tool message, and then instruct the model to produce the final output in your schema.\n\n---\n\n## Troubleshooting\n- Make sure each “step” is a separate message in the conversation.\n- Always explicitly ask the model (in a message) to consider the previous tool output and output in your schema.\n- If you use `\"text\": {\"format\": \"json_object\"}`, the model will try to output a valid JSON object.\n\n---\n\n## Example with `\"format\": \"json_object\"`\n\n```python\nfinal_response = openai.chat.completions.create(\n    model=\"gpt-4-1106-preview\",\n    messages=messages,\n    response_format={\"type\": \"json_object\"}\n)\n```\n\n---\n\n## Summary\n\nTo chain tool outputs and have the AI process them into a final output in a specific JSON schema:\n\n1. Call the tool and get its output.\n2. Feed the tool output back into the conversation as a tool message.\n3. Instruct the model to use the tool output to create the final result in your schema (optionally enforcing JSON output with `response_format`).\n\nIf you can provide the rest of your message, code snippets, or error messages, I can give more specific guidance!",

          "response": "It sounds like you have a multi-step process where:\n\n1. You first prompt the AI to produce some intermediate text or data.  \n2. You then want the AI to “consider” that intermediate output as part of the context for a final response.  \n3. The final response must conform to a specific JSON schema before being returned.\n\nWhen you say “It works whenever I use text: format: '...',” it suggests that your prompts and responses behave as expected in a more straightforward scenario (such as directly outputting text), but you’re having trouble structuring this in a multi-step process or ensuring the output is valid JSON.  \n\nBelow are some guidelines that often help when building this type of tool:\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n1. Prompt Engineering for Multi-Step Responses\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nIf you’re chaining outputs (i.e., sending an intermediate result back into the model in a subsequent prompt), you have two primary options:\n\nA) In-Code Chaining:  \n   • Make an API call to get the intermediate output.  \n   • Programmatically extract or store the result.  \n   • Feed that result into a new prompt in a second API call, instructing the model to incorporate or transform it.  \n\nB) Single Prompt with a “Thinking” Step:  \n   • Use a single prompt that includes instructions for first reasoning through the problem (in something like a hidden “let’s reason step by step” approach), then providing only the final structured output. For example, you might say “First, think through the problem step by step. Then, provide the final result in valid JSON according to this schema: …”. This is sometimes done with chain-of-thought prompting but that often works better in direct prompt usage, not necessarily in production.  \n\nGiven your description, approach A (in-code chaining) is more common if you truly need to capture an intermediate output, do something with it, and then feed it back on the next call.\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n2. Ensuring Valid JSON Output\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nTo ensure the final output is valid JSON, follow these best practices:\n\n• Add an explicit system or user instruction: “Return the data in the following JSON schema without additional text, code, or explanations.”  \n• Provide a short example of the exact JSON structure you want. For instance:\n\n  \"\"\"\n  You must output valid JSON following this schema:\n  {\n    \"summary\": \"string\",\n    \"metadata\": {\n      \"key\": \"string\",\n      \"value\": \"string\"\n    }\n  }\n  \"\"\"\n\n• If you are using openai.response.parse (or any JSON extraction technique), ensure your schema is somewhat flexible to handle any quirks in the AI’s text generation. Sometimes requiring a strict schema can lead to invalid JSON if you don’t handle edge cases in your application code (like unexpected quotes or line breaks).  \n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n3. Using openai.response.parse or Other Extraction Techniques\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n• If openai.response.parse is a function that parses responses to JSON (or some structured format), you might need to provide the model with explicit instructions like “Wrap all your output in a JSON code block,” or “Output only JSON, no markdown.”  \n• Then, in your code, you can strip out “```json” and “```” if the model adds them, or you can instruct the model not to include them at all.\n\nExample snippet (generic pseudocode):\n\n  # Step 1: get intermediate result\n  prompt_1 = \"Generate the intermediate data for the user’s request.\"\n  response_1 = openai.ChatCompletion.create(\n      ...\n      messages=[{\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": prompt_1}]\n  )\n  intermediate_output = response_1[\"choices\"][0][\"message\"][\"content\"]\n\n  # Step 2: feed intermediate output into prompt\n  prompt_2 = f\"\"\"\n  You are given the following data to consider:\n  {intermediate_output}\n\n  Now produce the final answer in valid JSON with the following schema:\n  {{\n    \"summary\": \"string\",\n    \"reasoning\": \"string\"\n  }}\n  Do not include any extra text. Return only valid JSON.\n  \"\"\"\n  response_2 = openai.ChatCompletion.create(\n      ...\n      messages=[{\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": prompt_2}]\n  )\n  final_output = response_2[\"choices\"][0][\"message\"][\"content\"]\n\n  # Step 3: parse final output as JSON\n  try:\n      final_json = json.loads(final_output)\n      # or use openai.response.parse if applicable\n  except json.JSONDecodeError:\n      # handle parsing errors\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n4. Handling Potential Model “Hallucinations”\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n• If the model sometimes returns text that doesn’t match your schema (for example, because it tries to add extra reasoning, disclaimers, or other text), you may need to add more explicit instructions or add a post-processing layer in your code.  \n• You can also try specifying a temperature of 0.0 to reduce creative output and keep the model closer to your strict instructions.\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n5. Common Pitfalls\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n• Not providing an example of the exact JSON structure you expect.  \n• Allowing the model to produce instructions or explanations instead of raw JSON.  \n• Using partial or ambiguous instructions that don’t explicitly demand “valid JSON.”  \n• Forgetting to handle unexpected tokens like trailing punctuation or disclaimers in the final output.\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n\nPutting it all together:\n1. Prompt the AI for intermediate data or text.  \n2. Store that result.  \n3. In a second prompt, supply the intermediate data back to the AI and instruct it to “use the data” and return the final JSON output.  \n4. If you need to parse it automatically, ensure you strictly instruct the model to output valid JSON, and then handle any exceptions in your code if the AI accidentally includes something else.\n\nThese steps usually provide a reliable method for multi-step transformation and final structured output. If you have additional details about how you’re calling openai.response.parse or the exact shape of your JSON schema, feel free to share them, and I can suggest more tailored debugging approaches.",

You mention it works when using text: format, but the rest of your message is missing.\n\nTo help you effectively, could you clarify:\n\n1. **What’s the full workflow?**  \n   Are you using OpenAI’s function calling (tools) to get structured outputs, and then want the AI to consider those outputs for a final response?\n\n2. **What’s the issue after using text: format?**  \n   Is the problem that when you use a different format (e.g., function/tool outputs), the AI doesn't \"see\" or consider the tool’s output in its final response?\n\n3. **What does your current prompt or API call look like?**  \n   This will help diagnose issues with context or chaining.\n\n### General Guidance\n\nWith OpenAI's function calling (tools) API, the typical workflow is:\n\n1. You send a user prompt and specify available tools (functions).\n2. The model decides if a tool should be called and emits a tool call.\n3. You execute the tool and return its result to the model as a tool message.\n4. The model receives the tool output and can now generate a final response, considering the tool's output.\n\n**Key point:** The model will only consider tool outputs if you pass them back in a new API call (as a message of type \"tool\" or \"function\" in the conversation history).\n\n**Example:**\n\n```json\n[\n  {\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"Get me the current weather in Boston and summarize it as a JSON.\"},\n  {\"role\": \"assistant\", \"content\": null, \"tool_calls\": [ ... ]},\n  {\"role\": \"tool\", \"tool_call_id\": \"...\", \"content\": \"{ 'temperature': 72, 'condition': 'sunny' }\"}\n]\n```\n\nThen the model can generate:\n\n```json\n{\"summary\": \"The weather in Boston is sunny and 72°F.\"}\n```\n\nIf you **only use text format**, the AI can't \"see\" the tool output unless you inject it into the prompt or message history.\n\n### If you want the AI to consider the tool’s output:\n\n- Ensure you’re correctly returning the tool output as a message of role \"tool\" (or \"function\" for older APIs) with the tool_call_id, so the AI can see and incorporate it.\n- Then, prompt for the final output (e.g., \"Now, summarize this information in the following schema: ...\").\n\n### If you share your full API call and what’s not working, I can give more targeted advice!\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nIt sounds like you need to make sure the tool output is passed back to the AI as a separate message, using the OpenAI function-calling protocol. This allows the model to consider the intermediate result before producing the final output in your desired JSON format.\n\nLet me know the details or clarify further, and I can help with concrete code or prompt examples!",

          "response": "Below are some suggestions and considerations for getting a JSON-based response from the OpenAI model—incorporating external tool output—so you can parse it reliably in your MCP server and/or via openai.response.parse. These steps assume you want to:\n\n1. Invoke a tool (or function) to generate some intermediate output.  \n2. Pass that output back into the model (or a follow-up request) so that the model can factor it into its final, strictly JSON-formatted output.  \n3. Ensure the final OpenAI response is valid JSON and can be parsed or used downstream.\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n1. Give the model clear instructions about the JSON schema\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n\nWhen you ask the model to produce JSON, be explicit and prescriptive. For example, if you need specific keys and types, provide a schema or a very explicit format. For instance:\n\n• Provide an example of valid JSON.  \n• Explicitly say “Do not include any additional text outside of the JSON object.”  \n• If you have an allowed or required property set, list them.  \n\nExample prompt snippet:\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nYou are an assistant that outputs JSON strictly in the following schema:\n\n{\n  \"result\": string,\n  \"analysis\": string,\n  \"metadata\": {\n    \"toolOutput\": string,\n    \"additionalNotes\": string\n  }\n}\n\nPlease do not include any additional keys, and do not include text outside the JSON.\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThis kind of guidance helps the model avoid extra commentary and ensures the response is parseable. If you need arrays or nested objects, just show those in the example schema as well.\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n2. Pass your tool’s (MCP server) output into the conversation\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n\nTo ensure the model “considers” the tool’s output, you can supply it via:\n\n• The system prompt: “The tool returned this output: <TOOL_OUTPUT>. Use it to fill in the JSON.”  \n• The user prompt directly: “Here is the tool output: <TOOL_OUTPUT>. Please produce a JSON object that includes it in 'metadata.toolOutput'.”  \n\nFor consistency, be sure the prompt states exactly where in the JSON the tool output belongs.\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n3. Use function calling (if available) for more robust JSON responses\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n\nIf you are using GPT-4 or GPT-3.5 with the “function calling” feature, you can instruct the model to produce JSON in a structured way by providing a function signature. The model will then produce a JSON object that matches your function’s parameter schema. For example (in pseudocode):\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n// Example function definition\n{\n  \"name\": \"report_tool_output\",\n  \"description\": \"Generate final JSON using output from a tool\",\n  \"parameters\": {\n    \"type\": \"object\",\n    \"properties\": {\n      \"result\": { \"type\": \"string\" },\n      \"analysis\": { \"type\": \"string\" },\n      \"metadata\": {\n        \"type\": \"object\",\n        \"properties\": {\n          \"toolOutput\": { \"type\": \"string\" },\n          \"additionalNotes\": { \"type\": \"string\" }\n        },\n        \"required\": [\"toolOutput\", \"additionalNotes\"]\n      }\n    },\n    \"required\": [\"result\", \"analysis\", \"metadata\"]\n  }\n}\n\n// Then you call the model with something like:\n{\n  \"messages\": [\n    {\n      \"role\": \"system\",\n      \"content\": \"You are a helpful assistant...\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"role\": \"user\",\n      \"content\": \"Here is the tool output: {TOOL_OUTPUT}...\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"functions\": [\n    {\n      \"name\": \"report_tool_output\",\n      \"description\": \"...\",\n      \"parameters\": { ... }  // the JSON schema above\n    }\n  ]\n}\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWhen GPT responds, it should return a valid JSON object in a standardized format so that your code (or openai.response.parse) can easily parse it. This approach is more robust than relying on the model not to produce extraneous text.\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n4. Validate the final JSON\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n\nWhenever the model returns JSON (with or without function calling):\n\n• Double-check that you receive valid JSON (no stray quotes, no trailing commas, no additional text).  \n• Use a JSON validator or a library (like Python’s json library, or similar) to confirm the structure.  \n• If possible, wrap your final JSON in triple backticks (“```”) in the model output so that it’s easy to separate from any system messages, especially if you’re not using the function-calling feature.\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n5. Example end-to-end flow\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n\nBelow is a high-level flow that should work well:\n\n1) Prompt the model to call a “tool” or “function” to get some data. This might be an external process or code snippet invoked by your MCP server.  \n2) Take the tool’s output and include it in your next request to the model.  \n3) In your next request, include an explicit JSON schema or function parameters. Example:\n\n   --------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n   // Pseudocode or conceptual example\n   system_prompt = \"\"\"\n   You are an AI that returns data in a strict JSON format.\n   \"\"\"\n\n   user_prompt = \"\"\"\n   The tool returned the following data:\n\n   Tool data: \"Some important text\"\n\n   Please generate JSON of the form:\n   {\n     \"result\": <string>,\n     \"analysis\": <string>,\n     \"metadata\": {\n       \"toolOutput\": <string>,\n       \"additionalNotes\": <string>\n     }\n   }\n\n   Use the 'toolOutput' field to include the exact tool data above.\n   \"\"\"\n\n   call OpenAI with {system_prompt, user_prompt, function: { schemaDefinition }}\n   --------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n4) The model responds with a JSON object (or function call) that includes the data. For example:\n\n   --------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n   {\n     \"result\": \"...\",\n     \"analysis\": \"...\",\n     \"metadata\": {\n       \"toolOutput\": \"Some important text\",\n       \"additionalNotes\": \"Here is how I'm using the tool output...\"\n     }\n   }\n   --------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n5) Use openai.response.parse or your own JSON parser to read the returned structured content, then handle it downstream.\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n\nSummary\n\n• Clearly define and enforce the JSON schema.  \n• Provide the output from your MCP server (tool output) to the model, telling it exactly where to place that data in the JSON.  \n• Consider using function calling for the most reliable JSON structure.  \n• Always validate the JSON response on your end.\n\nBy combining these approaches—including explicit JSON instructions, function calling (if available), and robust validation—you can ensure that you consistently get well-formed JSON, incorporate the external tool’s output, and parse the result successfully with openai.response.parse or any other method in your MCP environment.",

Step 3: Return tool output to the AI so it can consider it\n        followup_response = openai_client.chat_completion(\n            messages=[\n                {\"role\": \"system\", \"content\": \"You are an assistant...\"},\n                {\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": input_data},\n                {\"role\": \"function\", \"name\": tool_call['name'], \"content\": tool_output}\n            ],\n            functions=[...],  # Optional: redefine or remove tools if not needed\n            function_call=None,  # Now want AI to return final answer\n            response_format={\"type\": \"json_object\"}  # Enforce JSON schema\n        )\n        return followup_response['content']\n    else:\n        return initial_response['content']\n```\n\n## Key Points\n\n- **Tool output must be fed back to the AI**: After running your tool, inject the result as a function message so the model can \"see\" the output before producing the final response.\n- **Enforce JSON schema**: Use response_format={\"type\": \"json_object\"} in your OpenAI API call to enforce JSON output.\n- **If you only use text: format:** The model does not have access to tool outputs unless you explicitly feed them back.\n\n## Summary Table\n\n| Step                | Action                                                                 |\n|---------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| 1.

User: \"Summarize the file at URL X, then provide a JSON with its topic and summary.\"\n2. AI: Calls summarize_file(url=X)\n3. Your code runs summarize_file, gets summary.\n4.

Feed that output back into an OpenAI API call so that the AI can consider it.  \n3. Produce a final response in a specified JSON schema.\n\nThis example uses pseudo-code to illustrate the approach. If you are integrating with a specific library (such as a Node.js or Python SDK), simply adapt these steps accordingly.\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nPROCEDURE HandleTask(task: \"I have an MCP server that I am trying to use...\")\nBEGIN\n    IF task.isValid() THEN\n        Process(task)\n    ELSE\n        Reject(task)\nEND PROCEDURE\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n\n1. Get Intermediate Data from Your MCP Server\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n• You have an MCP server that returns some data or analysis you'd like the AI to consider.  \n• Let’s call that intermediate data “mcpResponse”.  \n\nExample (pseudo-code):\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nfunction getMCPData(input) {\n    // This function abstracts away the logic of communicating with your MCP server.\n    // Suppose it returns a string or JSON with the relevant content.\n    const mcpResponse = someMCPFunction(input);\n    return mcpResponse;\n}\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n\n2. Pass the MCP Output to OpenAI\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n• Once you have mcpResponse, you want to supply it as context to the AI.  \n• You can structure a Prompt template or openai.response.parse call to incorporate that data.  \n\nExample using a typical completion or chat approach (pseudo-code):\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nfunction callOpenAIWithMCPData(mcpData) {\n    // The following is a pseudo-code snippet that you would adapt to your library of choice.\n    // For example, if you are using the official OpenAI Node or Python library:\n    //\n    // Node (openai):\n    //   const { Configuration, OpenAIApi } = require(\"openai\");\n    //   const config = new Configuration({ apiKey: process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY });\n    //   const openai = new OpenAIApi(config);\n    //\n    // Python:\n    //   import openai\n    //   openai.api_key = \"YOUR_API_KEY\"\n\n    const prompt = `\n        The following content is from our MCP server. You must consider it before crafting a final\n        JSON response. MCP Data:\n        ${mcpData}\n\n        Now produce a JSON response with the following schema:\n        {\n          \"summary\": string,\n          \"details\": string,\n          \"recommendations\": [string]\n        }\n        \n        Please ensure valid JSON syntax.\n      `;\n\n    // Then call the OpenAI API:\n    const openAIResponse = openai.response.parse({\n        // Depending on the library, the method could be createChatCompletion or createCompletion.\n        // For example:\n        //\n        // model: \"gpt-4\",\n        // messages: [{ role: \"system\", content: \"You are a helpful assistant...\" },\n        //            { role: \"user\", content: prompt }],\n        // temperature: 0.7,\n        // ...\n    });\n\n    // Return the structured response from OpenAI.\n    return openAIResponse;\n}\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n\n3. Parse the AI Output to Validate JSON\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n• The AI should return valid JSON, but you’ll often want to validate or parse it.  \n• If using “openai.response.parse” or a similar library, it may already give you the response as JSON.  \n• If needed, manually JSON-parse and handle errors.  \n\nExample (pseudo-code):\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nfunction processAIResponse(aiResponse) {\n    try {\n        const jsonOutput = JSON.parse(aiResponse);\n        // Validate that jsonOutput has the keys \"summary\", \"details\", and \"recommendations\".\n        if (jsonOutput.summary && jsonOutput.details && Array.isArray(jsonOutput.recommendations)) {\n            return jsonOutput;\n        } else {\n            throw new Error(\"JSON schema is not valid.\");\n        }\n    } catch (e) {\n        // Handle parse or schema errors\n        console.error(\"Failed to parse or validate AI response:\", e);\n        return null;\n    }\n}\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n\n4. Integrate the Steps and Return the FinalJSON\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n• Combine everything in your main function or flow:  \n• Validate the user/task, call the MCP server for intermediate data, then call the AI, parse, and return.  \n\nExample (pseudo-code):\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nfunction handleTask(task) {\n    if (!task.isValid()) {\n        return { error: \"Task is invalid or malformed.\" };\n    }\n\n    // 1. Get data from MCP server\n    const mcpResponse = getMCPData(task.content);\n\n    // 2. Call OpenAI with the MCP data\n    const rawAIResponse = callOpenAIWithMCPData(mcpResponse);\n\n    // 3. Parse & validate the JSON output\n    const finalJSON = processAIResponse(rawAIResponse);\n\n    if (!finalJSON) {\n        return { error: \"Invalid JSON structure from AI.\" };\n    }\n\n    // Return the final JSON\n    return finalJSON;\n}\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n\n5. Tips for Ensuring Proper JSON Output\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n• Ask the model to produce JSON only. Provide explicit instructions like:  \n  “Do not include any extra text; return only valid JSON.”  \n• Provide an example JSON schema (like the snippet above).  \n• In a Chat API context, you can also use a system or developer message that carefully instructs the AI to reply only with JSON.\n\n6. Example of a Final JSON Output\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\nIf all goes smoothly, your finalJSON might look like:\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n{\n  \"summary\": \"The MCP server reported that all workflows are operational.\",\n  \"details\": \"No anomalies were found; recommended updates include performance improvements.\",\n  \"recommendations\": [\n    \"Increase cache size by 20%\",\n    \"Review load-balancing configuration\"\n  ]\n}\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n\nBy structuring your request clearly, and ensuring each step (MCP data retrieval, AI prompt, validation) is well-defined, you allow the AI to incorporate the MCP server’s output before returning a final JSON structured response. If you notice that the model often returns extra text or fails to produce valid JSON, tighten the instructions, or wrap the output in code fences when using the text completion (or set function_call/output format constraints in ChatGPT function calling if available).",

          "response": "Below is an explanation of techniques and design considerations that might help you get the desired behavior when chaining tool output into a final JSON response using the OpenAI responses API.\n\n──────────────────────────────\n1. Clarify the Workflow\n\nYou’re essentially doing two things in sequence:\n • First, you call an internal “tool” (or a preliminary call) to get a structured intermediate output (e.g., via text: format:\"…\").  \n • Then, you use that output as context for a call whose answer must conform to a specific JSON schema.\n\nOften this “chain-of-thought” mechanism helps the AI produce more informed responses.\n\n──────────────────────────────\n2. Why the Text Format Works\n\nYou mentioned that whenever you use a text: format (with the double quotes or correctly‐escaped string) the behavior is correct. This is likely because:\n • The text format forces the tool’s output to be unambiguous and follow the precise syntax you expect.\n • When the output is clearly delineated, you can reliably pass it as context for the next step.\n\nNon‑text modes (or ambiguous formats) can introduce unexpected formatting which may confuse the parser later in your process.\n\n──────────────────────────────\n3. Design Considerations for Your Process\n\na. Validate Inputs Early  \n Your pseudocode shows:\n  IF task.isValid() THEN Process(task) ELSE Reject(task)\n Always ensure task validation so that you do not pass unexpected data down the chain.\n\nb. Separation of Processing Steps  \n Consider a structure like:\n  – Step 1: Use a tool call (using openai.response.parse with text formatting) to extract the component you care about.  \n  – Step 2: Combine the tool’s output with additional instructions to produce a final prompt for the AI that includes a specification to conform to your desired JSON schema.\n\nc. Use Clear Formatting Instructions  \n When creating your final prompt, provide explicit instructions like:  \n  \"Using the following extracted data: [extracted_data] provide a JSON object that follows this schema: { 'field1': string, 'field2': number, ... }.\"  \n Encouraging strict adherence to output structure minimizes chances of deviation.\n\nd. Utilize OpenAI’s Parse Tools (if available)  \n Check if the API (or client library) supports a 'json_schema' parameter or similar. Incorporating a schema parameter can help enforce structure once you have the text-based intermediate output.\n\n──────────────────────────────\n4. An Illustrative Pseudocode Example\n\nBelow is a modified pseudocode version incorporating these ideas:\n\n PROCEDURE HandleTask(task: \"Your task description here\")\n BEGIN\n  // Validate the task early on\n  IF NOT task.isValid() THEN\n   Reject(task)\n   RETURN\n  END IF\n  \n  // Step 1: Extract intermediate output using text format to enforce structure\n  extracted_output ← openai.response.parse({\n   \"format\": \"text\",\n   \"prompt\": \"Extract the relevant data from the MCP server message: \" + task.details\n  })\n  \n  // [Optional] Validate extracted_output as needed\n  IF extracted_output is invalid THEN\n   Reject(task)\n   RETURN\n  END IF\n  \n  // Step 2: Build final prompt that incorporates the extracted output and enforce JSON schema\n  final_prompt ← \"Given the following data: \" + extracted_output + \n   \". Now produce a JSON output that matches this schema: { 'field1': string, 'field2': number }.\"\n  \n  // Call the API again to get a JSON response\n  final_response ← openai.response.parse({\n   \"format\": \"json\",   // or include a json_schema parameter if available\n   \"prompt\": final_prompt\n  })\n  \n  RETURN final_response\n END PROCEDURE\n\n──────────────────────────────\n5. Troubleshooting Tips\n\n• Ensure Escaping: When constructing your strings (especially for JSON), verify proper usage of quotes and escapes.\n• Log Intermediate Outputs: Logging the result after each step can help diagnose where the formatting might be deviating.\n• Schema Validation: If possible, perform programmatic JSON schema validation on the final output to catch errors early.\n\n──────────────────────────────\nSummary\n\nBy making explicit that your tool output is in a clear text format and using it carefully in the final JSON-producing prompt, you can help ensure the AI “considers” the intermediate output correctly. Structuring the process in two clear steps—first extracting necessary data and then reusing it to produce a final JSON conforming to your schema—is key to robust integration with the MCP server and the OpenAI responses API.\n\nThis approach should help you reliably produce output in the desired JSON schema.",

Let’s clarify and expand on your System Design Document, specifically Section 3.2: Request Processing, according to your requirements and context.\n\n---\n\n**Section 3.2: Request Processing**\n\n**Requirement:**  \nThe system integrates an MCP (Message Communication Protocol) server with the OpenAI API. The process involves sending a request to the OpenAI API, parsing the intermediate response using `openai.response.parse`, and then utilizing this parsed output as context for generating a final response. The final output must conform to a predefined JSON schema. This workflow functions correctly when using the `text:` format, but additional handling may be required for other formats.\n\n**Implementation:**  \n- The MCP server will receive incoming client requests.\n- Upon receiving a request, the MCP server forwards the prompt to the OpenAI API.\n- The OpenAI API returns an initial response.\n- The system invokes `openai.response.parse` to extract or transform the relevant portion of the response.\n- The parsed output is injected as context for a subsequent OpenAI API call, if necessary, or is used directly.\n- The final response from OpenAI is validated and formatted to adhere to the specified JSON schema before returning it to the client.\n- The system utilizes secure and standard API protocols (e.g., HTTPS, REST) for all communication.\n\n**Validation:**  \n- Automated integration tests will simulate full request/response cycles, including:\n  - Sending test prompts to the MCP server.\n  - Verifying that intermediate outputs from `openai.response.parse` are correctly extracted and considered for the final response.\n  - Ensuring the final output strictly matches the required JSON schema.\n- Unit tests will validate individual parsing, schema validation, and error handling logic.\n- End-to-end tests will confirm correct protocol usage and error recovery in the event of malformed responses.\n\n---\n\nIf you provide the specific JSON schema and more details about the formats or error cases you’re encountering, I can tailor this section further for your needs.",

That output should then be passed back into the AI processing flow for additional analysis.  \n• The final AI-generated response must adhere to a specific JSON schema.  \n• The process currently succeeds whenever using “text:” as the format in requests or responses. However, the design must also accommodate other structured response formats as needed.  \n\n3.2.2 Implementation\n----------------------------------------\n1. Architectural Overview  \n   a. The client (or any upstream service) sends a request to the MCP server.  \n   b. The MCP server processes command and control messages, orchestrating how the request is handled.  \n   c. The MCP server utilizes OpenAI’s responses API via openai.response.parse to handle AI interactions.  \n   d. Intermediate Data Flow:  \n      • The MCP server first calls a specialized tool or service to generate some initial data (e.g., a partial solution, a relevant context string, etc.).  \n      • That intermediate output is then passed to the OpenAI model, instructing it to incorporate or analyze the data before crafting the final response.  \n\n2. Data Exchange Format  \n   a. Use JSON-based or text-based request objects to pass payloads among services.  \n   b. For final outputs, ensure the AI’s response conforms strictly to the required JSON schema (e.g., specifying “status”, “data”, “errors” as necessary).  \n   c. The “text:” prefix or other structured markers can be employed if it helps the parser distinctly separate AI-generated text from regular text or logs.  \n\n3. Integration with openai.response.parse  \n   a. The openai.response.parse method will be called with carefully structured JSON or text prompts.  \n   b. Ensure that the pre-processing steps in the MCP server format the prompt so that the partial tool output is included unambiguously for the AI to reference.  \n   c. Validate that the AI model’s final response is still parsable under the expected JSON schema—particularly if any chain-of-thought or annotated text is present.  \n\n4. Protocols and Communication  \n   a. All interactions between the MCP server and the AI’s endpoint must use secure communication channels (HTTPS, TLS).  \n   b. Use standardized web service request/response patterns (e.g., RESTful endpoints, well-defined HTTP status codes).  \n   c. Error handling and retries should follow standard strategies (e.g., exponential backoff for transient errors).  \n\n5. Handling Schema Conformance  \n   a. Once the final AI response returns, the MCP server must parse and validate it against the JSON schema.  \n   b. If the response fails to pass schema validation, the MCP server can:  \n      • Log the event for troubleshooting.  \n      • Attempt a retry mechanism with an adjusted prompt or corrective instructions to the AI.  \n      • Return an appropriate system-level error status to upstream clients.  \n\n6. Implementation Checklist  \n   • Set up an MCP endpoint that acts as the main “orchestrator” for AI communication.  \n   • Implement a method that calls the required tool to generate initial context or a partial result.  \n   • Pass that partial result to the openai.response.parse method in a well-structured prompt.  \n   • Enforce JSON schema on the final response through a validation library.  \n\n3.2.3 Validation\n----------------------------------------\n• Automated Testing:  \n  1. Unit Tests:  \n     – Verify that partial results from the tool are correctly formatted before being sent to the AI model.  \n     – Test the openai.response.parse integration to ensure correct handling of inputs/outputs.  \n     – Confirm that JSON validation correctly identifies malformed or incomplete responses.  \n  2. Integration Tests:  \n     – Simulate a full end-to-end workflow where an external client request flows through the MCP server to the AI model, returning valid JSON.  \n     – Validate that error handling and fallback strategies are triggered correctly when the final response is outside the expected schema.  \n  3. Performance Tests:  \n     – Assess the time it takes to complete the request processing pipeline, focusing on concurrency and throughput in the MCP server.  \n     – Ensure that the system can handle surges in simultaneous requests without performance degradation or timeouts.  \n\n• Security Validation:  \n  – Confirm that communication with OpenAI’s API endpoints is encrypted via TLS.  \n  – Review access controls on the MCP server to ensure only authorized clients can initiate requests.  \n  – Inspect logging to guarantee sensitive information (e.g., partial result data, private keys) is masked or omitted.  \n\nBy implementing the above design for request processing, the system will consistently parse intermediate tool outputs, pass them through the AI model for final refinement, and generate valid JSON responses according to the required schema. The architecture ensures smooth integration between the MCP server and OpenAI’s API while maintaining reliability, security, and standard protocols.",

          "response": "Below is an example of how Section 3.2: Request Processing might be documented based on the provided requirements, implementation details, and validation criteria.\n\n──────────────────────────────\nSection 3.2: Request Processing\n\nOverview:\nThis section describes the design and processing flow for handling requests within the MCP server, which integrates with the OpenAI responses API. The design leverages the openai.response.parse tool to receive tool output, have that output considered, and then generate a final response structured in a specific JSON schema.\n\n1. Requirements:\n   • The MCP server shall integrate with the OpenAI responses API using openai.response.parse.\n   • The system must obtain an intermediate output via the tool, then allow the AI to consider that output as context before constructing the final output.\n   • The final output produced by the AI must conform to a specific JSON schema.\n   • The output generation process should behave consistently when using a text format input.\n   • The server shall support standard protocols for network communications and data exchange.\n\n2. Design and Implementation Details:\n   a. Request Flow and Data Handling:\n      • A client request is received by the MCP server, containing input parameters and intended processing instructions.\n      • The MCP server prepares the initial prompt and sends it to the OpenAI responses API.\n      • The tool “openai.response.parse” is invoked to extract or generate an intermediate formatted output based on the provided text, ensuring it adheres to the format required by subsequent processing.\n      • The extracted output is then incorporated into a new prompt, establishing context for the generation of the final output.\n      \n   b. Integration with OpenAI responses API:\n      • The system supports multiple payload formats but has been validated to work correctly when using the text format.\n      • The intermediate output is parsed and validated using the openai.response.parse tool, ensuring that any transformation required (e.g., conversion from text to a JSON intermediary) is performed accurately.\n      • The API call is wrapped within standard protocol requests (e.g., HTTPS) ensuring secure and reliable communication.\n      \n   c. Final Output Construction:\n      • With the consideration of the intermediate tool output, the final prompt is constructed with explicit instructions to produce a JSON document matching a specific schema.\n      • The design mandates that the final output includes necessary fields (e.g., “status”, “result”, “metadata”, etc.) as dictated by the JSON schema.\n      • The final response is then returned to the MCP server and forwarded to the client.\n\n3. Implementation Considerations:\n   • Standard Network Protocols: The system uses HTTPS for secure communication and JSON as the primary data-interchange format.\n   • Middleware: A middleware component is implemented to bridge between the MCP server business logic and the OpenAI responses API calls.\n   • Logging and Error Handling: The architecture incorporates comprehensive logging of both successful and failed steps, enabling easier diagnosis if the final output deviates from expectations.\n   • Configuration: Parameters such as API endpoints, request timeouts, and JSON schema validators are configurable to enable easy updates and maintenance.\n\n4. Validation and Testing:\n   • Automated Testing: Unit tests are created for each processing step (e.g., intermediate output parsing, final JSON schema validation) to ensure compliance with design requirements.\n   • Integration Testing: Automated scripts simulate full request flows—from input receipt to final JSON output—to verify that the tool chain (MCP server → openai.response.parse → OpenAI API) functions as expected.\n   • Schema Validation: The final output is automatically validated against the predefined JSON schema, ensuring all required fields are present and correctly formatted.\n   • Error Simulation: Tests include scenarios with incomplete or faulty tool output to confirm that error handling and logging mechanisms are robust.\n\n5. Summary:\n   The Request Processing design ensures that the MCP server seamlessly integrates with the OpenAI responses API using openai.response.parse to generate context-aware, JSON schema–compliant responses. By adhering to established protocols and incorporating automated testing/regression validation, the system meets the strict performance and reliability criteria required for deployed production environments.\n\n──────────────────────────────\n\nThis document section should serve as a precise guide for both developers and testers, ensuring that the integration behaves as intended and that any issues can be quickly identified and addressed during development and maintenance.",

Workflow Overview\n\nYou want to:\n- Use the OpenAI API to get some intermediate output (let’s call this “tool output”).\n- Pass that tool output back to the AI for it to consider before producing a final answer in a specific JSON schema.\n\nLet’s address each requirement step by step.\n\n---\n\n## Step 1: Dataset Preparation\n\n**Requirements:**\n- 1000+ training samples\n- 20% validation split\n- Target test accuracy: >95%\n\n**Approach:**\n- Collect or generate your dataset with relevant input-output pairs.\n- Example structure for each sample:\n  ```json\n  {\n    \"input\": \"raw user query or data\",\n    \"tool_output\": \"result from MCP server or other tool\",\n    \"final_output\": \"target JSON schema output\"\n  }\n  ```\n\n- Split the data:\n  - 80% for training (800+ samples)\n  - 20% for validation (200+ samples)\n\n---\n\n## Step 2: Model Architecture\n\n**Requirement:** Deep Neural Network\n\n**Recommended Approach:**\n- Use a two-step process:\n  1. **Tool Call**: Use the OpenAI function calling or tools API to get the intermediate output.\n  2. **Final Output Generation**: Feed both the original input and the tool output to the model to generate the final output.\n\n### Example with OpenAI Function Calling\n\n1. **First Step** (get tool output):\n    - Use OpenAI’s `functions` or `tools` feature to call your MCP server with the user input.\n    - Parse the result with `openai.response.parse` or directly use the function output.\n\n2. **Second Step** (consider tool output):\n    - Structure the prompt to include both the original input and the tool output:\n      ```\n      Given the user input: <input>\n      And the tool output: <tool_output>\n      Produce the final output in this JSON schema: { ... }\n      ```\n\n    - Use OpenAI's completion (or chat) endpoint with a prompt template, or fine-tune a model if you need more control.\n\n---\n\n## Step 3: JSON Schema Output\n\n- Define your target JSON schema, for example:\n  ```json\n  {\n    \"status\": \"success\",\n    \"answer\": \"...\",\n    \"metadata\": {...}\n  }\n  ```\n\n- Instruct the model (via system prompt or function definition) to always output in this schema.\n\n---\n\n## Step 4: Example Pipeline (Python Pseudocode)\n\n```python\nimport openai\n\ndef get_tool_output(input_text):\n    # Replace with actual call to your MCP server/tool\n    tool_output = call_mcp_server(input_text)\n    return tool_output\n\ndef get_final_output(input_text, tool_output):\n    prompt = (\n        f\"Given the user input: {input_text}\\n\"\n        f\"And the tool output: {tool_output}\\n\"\n        \"Produce the final output in this JSON schema: {...}\"\n    )\n    response = openai.ChatCompletion.create(\n        model=\"gpt-4\",  # Or your fine-tuned model\n        messages=[\n            {\"role\": \"system\", \"content\": \"You are a helpful assistant.\"},\n            {\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": prompt}\n        ]\n    )\n    return response['choices'][0]['message']['content']\n\n# Example usage\ninput_text = \"What is the sum of 2 and 3?\"\ntool_output = get_tool_output(input_text)\nfinal_output = get_final_output(input_text, tool_output)\nprint(final_output)\n```\n\n---\n\n## Step 5: Training & Validation\n\n- If you want a custom model, use your dataset to train a DNN (e.g., Transformer-based model).\n- Monitor validation accuracy, and adjust model complexity or dataset as needed to achieve >95% test accuracy.\n\n---\n\n## Step 6: OpenAI API Considerations\n\n- For production, consider using OpenAI’s function calling with tools, so the model can call your MCP server as needed and incorporate the result directly.\n\n---\n\n**If you have a specific error or issue (“it works whenever I use text: format: ...”), please provide more details so I can help debug or refine the workflow further.**\n\n---\n\n## Summary\n\n- Prepare your dataset with input, tool output, and target output in JSON.\n- Use a two-step pipeline: (1) get tool output, (2) generate final output considering tool output.\n- Enforce JSON schema in the model’s response via prompt or function definition.\n- Train/validate to meet accuracy targets.\n\nLet me know if you need a sample function definition for OpenAI, more details on dataset structure, or help with code!",

          "success": true,
          "response": "Below is one approach to chain outputs so that the AI “remembers” an intermediate result and then uses that information when constructing the final JSON output.\n\nBelow is an outline of a possible solution:\n\n─────────────────────────────  \n1. Two-Step (or Chain-of-Thought) Process\n\n• Step 1 – Intermediate Parsing:\n  – Your first call to openai.response.parse “text:” uses a prompt that produces the output you need (for example your “Dataset Requirements: …” snippet).\n  – This output is then stored as an intermediate variable (or “hook”) on your MCP server.\n\n• Step 2 – Final JSON Output:\n  – When you make a call to the API for the final response, you include the previously generated intermediate output as part of the prompt. For example, your system or user message can say:\n  \n    “Please consider the following output from an earlier step:\n    \n    [INTERMEDIATE_OUTPUT]\n\n    Now generate the final output in the JSON schema below:\n    {\n      \"dataset\": { \"samples\": “”, \"validation_split\": “” },\n      \"architecture\": “”,\n      \"performance\": { \"test_accuracy\": “” }\n    }”\n    \n  – This way, the AI has the intermediate analysis available for context.\n\n─────────────────────────────  \n2. Implementation Hints\n\n• Ensure that your MCP server stores the intermediate output reliably and passes it as context into the final API call.\n  \n• Format the prompt clearly. For example, you could use a multi-turn dialogue or a context-rich system prompt that summarizes:\n  \n    \"Earlier, you generated the following details: [intermediate output]. Now, combine that information with [any extra instructions] to produce the final JSON result.\"\n\n• Double-check that your final prompt explicitly defines the desired JSON fields so that the parser function (openai.response.parse) can reliably extract the JSON. You might include an “Example JSON” structure in the prompt.\n\n─────────────────────────────  \n3. Code Sketch (in Python-like pseudocode):\n\nAssuming you have a function call openai_response() that takes your prompt and returns the output:\n\n----------------------------------------------------\n# Step 1: Get the intermediate output\nprompt_intermediate = \"\"\"\nPlease provide the details in text:\nDataset Requirements:\n- Training samples: 1000+\n- Validation split: 20%\n- Test accuracy: >95+\n\nModel Architecture: Deep Neural Network\n\"\"\"\n\nintermediate_output = openai_response(prompt_intermediate)\n# Save the intermediate_output for use in the next stage\n\n# Step 2: Generate the final JSON output using the stored context\nprompt_final = f\"\"\"\nUsing the earlier provided details:\n{intermediate_output}\nNow please generate the final output using the following JSON schema exactly:\n{\n  \"dataset\": {\n    \"samples\": \"<value>\", \n    \"validation_split\": \"<value>\"\n  },\n  \"architecture\": \"<value>\",\n  \"performance\": {\n    \"test_accuracy\": \"<value>\"\n  }\n}\nPlease fill in the appropriate details accordingly.\n\"\"\"\n\nfinal_output = openai_response(prompt_final)\nfinal_json = openai.response.parse(final_output)\n----------------------------------------------------\n\nThis two-step approach ensures that the AI “sees” the first output before creating the final JSON result.\n\n─────────────────────────────  \n4. Other Considerations\n\n• Token Limits: When passing the intermediate result in the final prompt, be mindful of any token limits; if the intermediate text is lengthy, consider summarizing or trimming appropriately.\n\n• Prompt Engineering: Experiment with different prompt phrasings or chain-of-thought instructions so that the intermediate output is clearly available to the AI when forming the final answer.\n\n• Error Handling: In your MCP server’s code, always validate that the resulting JSON conforms to your schema and handle any errors (for example, missing fields) as needed.\n\n─────────────────────────────  \nSummary\n\nBy splitting the task into two discrete steps and explicitly incorporating the intermediate output into your subsequent API call, you enable the AI to “consider” that output in creating a final structured JSON answer. This approach works well with openai.response.parse when you want to enforce a machine-readable schema in your final output.\n\nFeel free to modify the prompt or code as needed based on your server’s requirements or the specifics of your language model implementation.",

          "response": "Based on your description, you have an MCP server, you're using the OpenAI Responses API (likely the v1/chat/completions endpoint with tools/function calling), and your goal is to:\n\n1. Get an initial output from a tool (function call).\n2. Have the AI \"consider\" (see/process) that output.\n3. Generate a final output in a specific JSON schema.\n\nYou mention that this works when you use text: format: ‘ but not otherwise (your sentence is cut off). I will infer the possible issues and solutions:\n\n**Key Considerations:**\n\n- OpenAI's function calling (tools) pipeline is designed for **multi-turn reasoning**. You send a message, it decides to call a tool, the tool returns data, you feed that back into the conversation, and then the model generates the final answer, possibly adhering to a JSON schema.\n- The \"consideration\" step requires you to **return the tool output as a message from the 'tool' role** before asking for the final output.\n\n**Possible Issues and Solutions:**\n\n### 1. Proper Function Call Loop\n\n**Correct Pipeline:**\n\n1. User message: \"Get X, then consider it and return Y in this schema.\"\n2. AI responds with function_call: { name: ..., arguments: ... }\n3. MCP server executes the function/tool, gets output.\n4. MCP server sends a new message to OpenAI:\n   - role: \"tool\"\n   - content: (tool output as JSON or text)\n   - tool_call_id: (from previous step)\n5. OpenAI now \"sees\" the tool output and can use it to generate the final response in your schema.\n\n**Check:** Are you sending the tool output back as a 'tool' role message before the final user/AI step? If not, the model cannot \"consider\" the intermediate output.\n\n---\n\n### 2. Output Format/Schema\n\nIf it only works with text: format: '...', perhaps your schema is not enforced. To force a specific JSON schema:\n\n- Instruct the model clearly in your system prompt/user prompt:  \n  \"After considering the tool output, respond ONLY in the following JSON schema: {...}\"\n- Use response_format: { \"type\": \"json_object\" } if available (recent OpenAI API), or post-process the output.\n\n---\n\n### 3. Example Pseudocode Using openai.response.parse\n\nHere’s a simplified flow:\n\n```python\nmessages = [\n    {\"role\": \"system\", \"content\": \"You are an assistant.\"},\n    {\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"Get weather for Boston, then return it in JSON: {city, temp, desc}.\"}\n]\n\n# Step 1: Send to OpenAI with tool definition\nresponse = openai.chat.completions.create(\n    model=\"gpt-4-1106-preview\",\n    messages=messages,\n    tools=[weather_function],\n    tool_choice=\"auto\"\n)\n\n# Step 2: If function_call, execute tool and get result\nfunction_call = response.choices[0].message.tool_calls[0]  # depends on SDK\ntool_result = call_weather_api(function_call.arguments)  # your MCP server logic\n\n# Step 3: Send tool result back as 'tool' message\nmessages.append({\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"tool_calls\": [function_call]\n})\nmessages.append({\n    \"role\": \"tool\",\n    \"tool_call_id\": function_call.id,\n    \"content\": json.dumps(tool_result)\n})\n\n# Step 4: Now, ask for the final output in your schema\nresponse2 = openai.chat.completions.create(\n    model=\"gpt-4-1106-preview\",\n    messages=messages,\n    response_format={\"type\": \"json_object\"}\n)\nfinal_output = response2.choices[0].message.content\n```\n\n---\n\n### 4. Debugging Checklist\n\n- Are you correctly capturing and passing the tool output as a 'tool' role message, not just appending it as text?\n- Are you specifying the desired output schema in your prompt and/or using the new response_format parameter?\n- Is your MCP server properly handling the multi-turn interactive flow (not just returning the first function call's output)?\n\n---\n\n## Summary Table\n\n| Step | Role    | Content                                                    |\n|------|---------|------------------------------------------------------------|\n| 1    | user    | Ask initial question/task                                  |\n| 2    | assistant | Decides to call a tool/function                          |\n| 3    | tool    | Return tool/function output (as JSON/text)                 |\n| 4    | assistant | Considers tool output, produces final output in schema   |\n\n---\n\nIf you clarify your code or the exact error, I can provide more targeted advice! But the most common pitfall is **not feeding the tool output back as a 'tool' role message** before asking for the final AI output. This breaks the reasoning chain.\n\nLet me know if you need an exact code sample for your stack!",

          "response": "Below is an outline of how you can set up a multi-step approach with OpenAI (for example, using “openai.response.parse”) so that your server-side code can retrieve an intermediate result, process or transform it, and then incorporate that output into a final JSON structure. The key ideas are:\n\n1. Use a “text” (or raw string) response from OpenAI when you need to do intermediate parsing logic (e.g., scanning for specific data or formatting “by hand”).  \n2. Once you have the intermediate data you need, feed it back into a second prompt (or function call) to generate the final output in your desired JSON schema.  \n3. Make sure the final step includes strong instruction for the model to produce valid JSON—especially if you’re using a custom schema.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n1) Break your logic into two steps\n\nStep A: The “intermediate” prompt  \n• The goal of this call is to get whatever you need from the AI in a more flexible form: it could be a snippet of text, bullet points, partial JSON, etc.  \n• Let’s imagine you have a specialized prompt that queries or extracts key data, then you parse it on your end.\n\nFor example:\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n# Step A prompt (pseudo-code)\nresponse = openai.ChatCompletion.create(\n  model=\"gpt-3.5-turbo\",\n  messages=[\n    {\"role\": \"system\", \"content\": \"You are a helpful assistant.\"},\n    {\n      \"role\": \"user\",\n      \"content\": \"Extract the user’s name, email, and a summary from the following content: ...\"\n    }\n  ],\n  # If you're using openai.response.parse or a third-party library, you might\n  # want a plain text completion so you can parse it reliably.\n  temperature=0.0\n)\n\n# Now parse the response (pseudo-code):\nparsed_data = parse_intermediate_response(response.choices[0].message.content)\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nStep B: The “final” JSON prompt (or function call)\n• Take all the data from parsed_data (the output from Step A) and feed it into the next prompt.  \n• In this prompt, instruct the model to produce valid JSON in the exact shape you need.\n\nIf you’re using ChatCompletion with function calling (supported by gpt-3.5-turbo-0613 or later and gpt-4-0613 or later), you can define a function schema that matches your desired JSON output. If you’re not using function calling, you can simply instruct the model to provide strictly valid JSON with a prompt like:\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n# Step B prompt (pseudo-code)\njson_prompt = f\"\"\"\nI have the following data:\nName: {parsed_data[\"name\"]}\nEmail: {parsed_data[\"email\"]}\nSummary: {parsed_data[\"summary\"]}\n\nPlease provide a valid JSON object, with the following format:\n{{\n  \"user\": {{\n    \"name\": \"<string>\",\n    \"email\": \"<string>\"\n  }},\n  \"summary\": \"<string>\"\n}}\n\"\"\"\n\nresponse_final = openai.ChatCompletion.create(\n  model=\"gpt-3.5-turbo\",\n  messages=[\n    {\"role\": \"system\", \"content\": \"You are a JSON output generator.\"},\n    {\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": json_prompt}\n  ],\n  temperature=0.0\n)\n\nfinal_json_str = response_final.choices[0].message.content\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n2) Handling partial text formats that break JSON\n\nWhen you say “It works whenever I use text: format: …,” that typically means your code or library is expecting raw text to parse. If you attempt to get direct JSON from the model but run into formatting issues (e.g., extra text, disclaimers, or apology statements), you might:\n\n• Add explicit instructions: “Return only JSON, do not include any additional text.”  \n• Use function calling (if possible)—the chat API can directly give you structured JSON in the “arguments” property without extra text.  \n• Post-process the model’s response to isolate the JSON. A robust approach is to attempt a JSON parse on the portion between the first “{” and the last “}” bracket.\n\n3) Ensuring the final schema matches exactly\n\nIf your final schema is strict (for example, machine-readable by your MCP server), be sure to:\n\n• Validate the JSON after the final step.  \n• Possibly use a library (like Python’s jsonschema) to confirm the model’s output is correct.  \n• Provide minimal degrees of freedom for the model: set temperature to 0.0, and reiterate: “Do not include additional keys, descriptions, or disclaimers.”\n\n4) Example using function calling (optional)\n\nIf you’re using a newer ChatCompletion model that supports function calling, you can define something like:\n\n--------------------------------------------------\nfunctions = [\n  {\n    \"name\": \"createData\",\n    \"description\": \"Creates a JSON with user information and a summary\",\n    \"parameters\": {\n      \"type\": \"object\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"user\": {\n          \"type\": \"object\",\n          \"properties\": {\n            \"name\": {\"type\": \"string\"},\n            \"email\": {\"type\": \"string\"}\n          },\n          \"required\": [\"name\", \"email\"]\n        },\n        \"summary\": {\n          \"type\": \"string\"\n        }\n      },\n      \"required\": [\"user\", \"summary\"]\n    }\n  }\n]\n\nstep_a_result = openai.ChatCompletion.create(\n  model=\"gpt-3.5-turbo-0613\",\n  messages=[\n    {\"role\": \"system\", \"content\": \"You are extracting data.\"},\n    {\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"Extract the user’s name, email, summary from: ...\"}\n  ],\n  temperature=0.0\n)\n\n# Suppose we parse step_a_result and store the relevant fields in local variables.\n\nstep_b_result = openai.ChatCompletion.create(\n  model=\"gpt-3.5-turbo-0613\",\n  messages=[\n    {\"role\":\"system\",\"content\":\"You are a JSON output generator.\"},\n    {\"role\":\"user\",\"content\":\"Now create the final JSON from the extracted values.\"}\n  ],\n  functions=functions,\n  function_call={\"name\":\"createData\"},  # Force the model to call createData\n  temperature=0.0\n)\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nHaving the model specifically call your defined function ensures the response is only JSON in the shape specified by your parameters.\n\n5) Summary & Recommendations\n\n• Use a two-step (or multi-step) approach so OpenAI can generate partial results that your code can parse/clean before generating schema-based output.  \n• If you are forced to rely on plain text completions, isolate the JSON portion in the final step or strongly instruct the model to return purely valid JSON.  \n• If possible, experiment with ChatCompletion function calling, which can eliminate many JSON formatting headaches by returning structured data in the model’s function call arguments.\n\nHopefully this provides a clearer picture of how to combine an MCP server (or any server that needs strict JSON) with OpenAI’s multi-step prompt approach, leveraging either raw completions or function-calling.

You then want the OpenAI responses API (using openai.response.parse) to use that output as context so that the final response it generates conforms to a specific JSON schema.\n\nBased on your description, here are some suggestions and things to check:\n\n• Chain Your Steps Explicitly  \n  Make sure that once the initial tool (which produces the “certain output”) runs successfully, you’re capturing its output correctly and then passing that output as part of the context (or prompt) in your next API call. In many workflows, you’d store the tool’s output in a variable and then add it as a “system prompt” or “assistant message” so the model considers it in the final generation.\n\n• Control the Format Rigorously  \n  If you state that it “works whenever I use text: format: '” (i.e. when you supply plain text), then it may be that the parser expects a clean, unadorned text output that exactly matches your JSON schema. Ensure that:\n  – The initial output is strictly in the format you expect.\n  – When you include it in the next prompt, you instruct the model not to add any extra commentary, explanations, or formatting like markdown syntax.  \n  A common tactic is to explicitly tell the model:  \n  \"Output only a valid JSON object that conforms to the following schema: {...}\"  \n  Double-check the prompt instructions and include sample outputs if possible.\n\n• Validate JSON Schema Compliance  \n  Since your final output must adhere to a JSON schema, consider adding a post-generation validation step. Once the final output is generated, pass it through a validator (or use try/except logic in your code) to catch any deviations. This can help when you’re debugging if the model’s final output isn’t parseable by openai.response.parse.\n\n• Parameter Settings and Timeout/Retry  \n  Your configuration parameters (PROCESSING_ENABLED, LOG_LEVEL, TIMEOUT, RETRY_COUNT) suggest that you’re handling errors and potential timeouts. Verify that the retry logic doesn’t inadvertently re-trigger prompts in a way that might change the chain-of-thought context. Logging (LOG_LEVEL=INFO) can help in determining if the output of the first tool is being correctly captured and forwarded.\n\n• Example Flow  \n  1. First API/tool call:  \n  - Use your MCP server to generate the output.  \n  - Let’s say the tool returns something like:  \n   { \"data\": \"XYZ\", \"details\": \"This output should be referenced\" }\n  2. Second API call:  \n  - In your prompt, include a clear instruction, for example:  \n   \"Based on the above output {insert tool output here}, produce a final response in exactly the following JSON format: { ...JSON schema... }\"  \n  - Ensure that your prompt contains a directive such as, \"Do not include any other text or explanation.\"\n\n• In Summary  \nCheck that you’re:\n  ○ Capturing the tool output completely and correctly.\n  ○ Instructing the model clearly to incorporate that output into a final answer that strictly adheres to your JSON schema.\n  ○ Validating the final output to ensure it’s well-formed JSON.\n\nIf you need more detailed help, you might want to share a minimal reproducible example (with sample input, the JSON schema, and the prompt you use for the final generation) so that any mismatches can be diagnosed.\n\nLet me know if you have additional questions or if there’s a specific part of the workflow that isn’t working as intended!",

Let me help you troubleshoot this integration.\n\n## Common Issues and Solutions\n\n### 1. **Schema Compatibility**\nWhen using `openai.response.parse` with structured outputs, ensure your JSON schema is compatible:\n\n```python\nimport openai\nfrom pydantic import BaseModel\n\n# Define your output schema\nclass FinalOutput(BaseModel):\n    result: str\n    confidence: float\n    reasoning: str\n\n# MCP tool call first\nmcp_result = await mcp_client.call_tool(\"your_tool\", parameters)\n\n# Then use in OpenAI call\ncompletion = openai.beta.chat.completions.parse(\n    model=\"gpt-4o-2024-08-06\",  # Ensure you're using a compatible model\n    messages=[\n        {\"role\": \"system\", \"content\": \"Consider the MCP tool output and provide structured response\"},\n        {\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": f\"Tool output: {mcp_result}\\nProvide analysis in the required format\"}\n    ],\n    response_format=FinalOutput,\n)\n```\n\n### 2. **Tool Output Serialization**\nEnsure MCP tool outputs are properly serialized:\n\n```python\n# If MCP returns complex objects, serialize them properly\nif isinstance(mcp_result, dict):\n    tool_output_text = json.dumps(mcp_result, indent=2)\nelse:\n    tool_output_text = str(mcp_result)\n```\n\n### 3. **Two-Step Processing Pattern**\nStructure your workflow to clearly separate tool usage from final parsing:\n\n```python\nasync def process_with_mcp_and_structured_output(query: str):\n    # Step 1: Get MCP tool result\n    mcp_response = await mcp_server.call_tool(\n        name=\"your_tool\",\n        arguments={\"query\": query}\n    )\n    \n    # Step 2: Process with OpenAI structured output\n    messages = [\n        {\n            \"role\": \"system\", \n            \"content\": \"You will receive tool output and must analyze it according to the specified schema.\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"role\": \"user\", \n            \"content\": f\"Tool provided this data:\\n{mcp_response}\\n\\nAnalyze and respond in the required format.\"\n        }\n    ]\n    \n    completion = openai.beta.chat.completions.parse(\n        model=\"gpt-4o-2024-08-06\",\n        messages=messages,\n        response_format=YourSchema\n    )\n    \n    return completion.choices[0].message.parsed\n```\n\n### 4. **Error Handling for Non-Text Formats**\nAdd robust error handling:\n\n```python\ntry:\n    # Your MCP + OpenAI integration\n    result = await process_with_tools()\nexcept openai.BadRequestError as e:\n    if \"schema\" in str(e).lower():\n        # Fall back to text format if schema issues\n        print(\"Schema validation failed, falling back to text format\")\n        # Retry with text format\n    else:\n        raise e\n```\n\n### 5. **Configuration for Your Setup**\nBased on your environment variables:\n\n```python\nimport asyncio\nimport logging\nfrom typing import Optional\n\n# Configure logging\nlogging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO)\nlogger = logging.getLogger(__name__)\n\nclass MCPOpenAIIntegration:\n    def __init__(self, timeout: int = 30, retry_count: int = 3):\n        self.timeout = timeout\n        self.retry_count = retry_count\n    \n    async def process_with_retries(self, mcp_tool_name: str, tool_params: dict, schema: BaseModel):\n        for attempt in range(self.retry_count):\n            try:\n                # MCP tool call with timeout\n                mcp_task = asyncio.create_task(\n                    self.call_mcp_tool(mcp_tool_name, tool_params)\n                )\n                mcp_result = await asyncio.wait_for(mcp_task, timeout=self",

Use a tool (possibly a function/tool call in the OpenAI API) to get intermediate output.\n2. Have the AI \"consider\" or incorporate that intermediate output before producing a final response in a certain JSON schema.\n3. You mention it works when you use the text: format, but your message seems to cut off there.\n\nTo help you further, here are some clarifying questions and suggestions:\n\n### Questions:\n- What exactly is the \"tool\"—is it an OpenAI function, a plugin, or a separate API call?\n- Are you using OpenAI function calling (tools) in the API, or just parsing responses from the model?\n- What does your current request/response workflow look like? (A sample request/response would help.)\n- What isn't working when you try to use the json schema? Is the AI not considering the tool output, or is the final output not matching your schema?\n- What do you mean by \"text: format\"? Are you referring to the model outputting plain text instead of JSON?\n\n### General Guidance:\nIf you want the AI to process data from a tool call and then produce a final output in a specific JSON schema, you typically do:\n\n1. Call the OpenAI API with function/tool definitions.\n2. When the model responds with a tool call, execute the tool on your side (MCP server).\n3. Pass the tool output BACK to the model in a new message (role: function or tool).\n4. Ask the model to produce the final output in your desired JSON schema, possibly by providing an explicit prompt or function definition.\n\n#### Example (OpenAI API function calling):\n```python\n# Step 1: Send initial user message and function definitions\nresponse = openai.ChatCompletion.create(\n    model=\"gpt-4-0613\",\n    messages=[\n        {\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"Do X and give me the result in this schema: ...\"}\n    ],\n    functions=[ ... ],  # Your function definition\n)\n\n# Step 2: If the model calls your tool/function, execute it and pass the result back:\ntool_output = run_my_tool(response['choices'][0]['message']['tool_call']['arguments'])\n# Step 3: Pass tool output back to OpenAI\nresponse2 = openai.ChatCompletion.create(\n    model=\"gpt-4-0613\",\n    messages=[\n        {\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"Do X and give me the result in this schema: ...\"},\n        {\"role\": \"tool\", \"content\": json.dumps(tool_output), \"name\": \"my_tool\"}\n    ],\n    functions=[ ... ],\n)\n# Step 4: Parse the final output\nfinal_json = openai.response.parse(response2)\n```\n\n#### Tips:\n- If your schema is not being respected, ensure your prompt or function definition makes the output schema very clear.\n- If you want the AI to consider the tool output, make sure it is included as context in the conversation (as a \"tool\" or \"function\" message).\n- If you’re using openai.response.parse, remember it expects a response that matches the schema.\n\n---\n\n**If you provide your current prompt, schema, and a sample of what works vs. what doesn't, I can give more precise help—including code or prompt structure suggestions.**",

Pass that intermediate output to the OpenAI “responses API” (using openai.response.parse, if I’m understanding correctly).  \n3. Have the AI consider that intermediate output, then produce its final answer in a specific JSON schema.\n\nIf it works in a “text:” format but not in other formats, here are a few potential points to check or adjust:\n\n1) Ensure the Output Content is Valid JSON  \n   • If your “final output” must be in a JSON schema, make sure the model is instructed with a system or user message that explicitly says “Please respond only with valid JSON matching the following schema…” or something similar.  \n   • If you’re concatenating responses or building JSON in a multi-step flow, ensure those intermediate strings don’t break JSON structure (extra quotes, commas, or unescaped special characters).\n\n2) Use Function Calls (If Available)  \n   • If you are working with the newer OpenAI Chat models, consider using function calling to enforce a JSON schema. This approach allows you to provide the model with a function signature that describes the JSON shape you expect. The AI will return data exactly in that schema, which can simplify parsing.  \n   • This avoids problems where the response might include explanation text or other tokens outside of the JSON.\n\n3) Pass the Intermediate Output as Context  \n   • In your prompt (or in the “system” or “context” portion of your OpenAI request), clarify the intermediate data you want the AI to consider. Something like:  \n     “You are given the following intermediate output: <paste-output-here>.  \n      With this output, produce the final JSON in this schema: …”  \n   • Make it explicit that the AI should incorporate that output into the final JSON.\n\n4) Check the openai.response.parse Behavior  \n   • If “openai.response.parse” is a custom or third-party utility, confirm that it expects exactly the format you are providing. Some parsing utilities are sensitive to slight formatting differences (missing fields, extra whitespace, or the presence of multiline responses).  \n   • Try logging exactly what you pass to openai.response.parse, as well as its returned output. This helps confirm whether the parse step or the model response is the issue.\n\n5) Validate Step by Step  \n   • It looks like you have a ValidationService that reports “Status: OK” in your trace. Confirm that your validation explicitly checks your final JSON structure. If possible, expand those validation checks (e.g., using JSON schema validation) to ensure it’s truly matching the structure you expect.  \n   • If your request logs show partial or malformed JSON, you may need to wrap the entire AI output in code blocks or explicitly instruct the model to output only JSON with no extra text.\n\nIn general, when bridging multiple tools (MCP server, openai.response.parse, validation steps, etc.), the most common issues are:  \n• Format mismatches (e.g., extra text outside JSON).  \n• Parsing assumptions that don’t match the actual output.  \n• Not passing the entire relevant context (the intermediate result) into the AI prompt.  \n• Not explicitly prompting the AI to respond in pure JSON.\n\nBy focusing on (1) the prompt instructions, (2) verifying the raw response from OpenAI, (3) ensuring your parse/validation steps align with that raw response, and (4) leveraging function calling if possible, you can usually resolve the “It works in text: format but not in others” issues.",

          "response": "It looks like you’re in the middle of debugging your integration between an MCP server and the OpenAI responses API. From your logs, I see that you’re using openai.response.parse to extract an output (likely in JSON) and then feeding that output back into the AI so it can generate a final response in a specific JSON schema. You also mentioned that everything works correctly when you use a “text:” format.\n\nHere are a few points and questions that might help narrow down the issue or clarify your setup:\n\n1. Intermediate Output vs. Final Output:  \n • It sounds like you’re first extracting some tool output (maybe via a chain-of-thought or an intermediate step) and then using that as a “context” for the final AI output. When you use plain text as your output format, the parsing works fine.  \n • Are you attempting to transition from plain text to a JSON object at some point? If so, make sure that the output produced is valid JSON before you feed it back into the final response generation. Even minor formatting issues (extra quotes, misplaced commas, etc.) can cause parsing errors.\n\n2. Using openai.response.parse:  \n • Ensure that when you’re calling openai.response.parse, you’re sending it a string that exactly matches the expected schema. Sometimes, unexpected characters or whitespace can cause the parser to fail.  \n • Check whether your intermediate step (if it’s producing text) is being correctly converted into JSON. For example, a robust approach might involve first validating that the output is well-formed JSON (perhaps with an additional validation function) before handing it off to the final generation step.\n\n3. Debugging Tips:  \n • Since your logs indicate [TRACE] and [DEBUG] messages and show that ValidationService.validate() reports OK and ExecutionEngine.run() is Processing, it seems that the lower-level services are working. This points toward an issue with the data exchange or formatting between the steps.  \n • You may want to print or log the intermediate output so you can verify that it indeed fits the JSON schema you expect. This could help pinpoint if it’s a formatting issue or something else.\n\n4. Questions for Clarification:  \n • When you say “It works whenever I use text: format,” do you mean that the entire workflow (including the final output) is correct with a plain text output but not when you switch to a JSON-specific schema?  \n • Have you confirmed that the JSON produced in the intermediate step is strictly adhering to the schema required by the final API call or processing function?\n • Is openai.response.parse set up to parse only text-based input, or can it handle JSON as well? Sometimes tools are geared toward text-parsing unless explicitly told to handle JSON.\n\n5. Suggestions:  \n • If possible, add an extra validation step after generating the text and before reprocessing it as JSON. Libraries like JSON Schema validators can be used to enforce the structure.  \n • Consider having a fallback or error-handling strategy in case parsing fails. This might include logging the exact output and error details so you can adjust your generation format accordingly.\n\nIf you can provide more details about what “doesn’t work” when not using the text format (for example, error messages or unexpected behaviors), I can offer more detailed help.

You use OpenAI's response parsing with a tool call\n3. The AI considers the tool output before generating a final structured JSON response\n\nBased on your description that \"it works whenever I use text format,\" I'm guessing you might be running into issues when trying to use structured outputs or specific JSON schemas. Here are some common patterns and potential issues:\n\n## Typical Workflow Pattern\n\n```python\nimport openai\nfrom openai import OpenAI\n\nclient = OpenAI()\n\n# First call - use the MCP tool\nresponse = client.chat.completions.create(\n    model=\"gpt-4\",\n    messages=[\n        {\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"I need information about X\"}\n    ],\n    tools=[\n        {\n            \"type\": \"function\",\n            \"function\": {\n                \"name\": \"mcp_tool_name\",\n                \"description\": \"Gets data from MCP server\",\n                \"parameters\": {\n                    \"type\": \"object\",\n                    \"properties\": {\n                        \"query\": {\"type\": \"string\"}\n                    }\n                }\n            }\n        }\n    ],\n    tool_choice=\"auto\"\n)\n\n# Handle tool call and get MCP server response\ntool_output = \"...\" # Your MCP server response\n\n# Second call - structured output with tool context\nfinal_response = client.beta.chat.completions.parse(\n    model=\"gpt-4\",\n    messages=[\n        {\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"Original request\"},\n        {\"role\": \"assistant\", \"content\": \"\", \"tool_calls\": [...]},\n        {\"role\": \"tool\", \"content\": tool_output, \"tool_call_id\": \"...\"},\n        {\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"Based on this tool output, provide the final structured response\"}\n    ],\n    response_format=YourPydanticModel\n)\n```\n\n## Common Issues & Solutions\n\n**1. Schema Complexity**\n```python\n# If your schema is too complex, try simplifying\nfrom pydantic import BaseModel\nfrom typing import List, Optional\n\nclass SimpleSchema(BaseModel):\n    result: str\n    confidence: float\n    sources: List[str]\n```\n\n**2. Message Context**\nMake sure you're including the tool interaction in your message history:\n```python\nmessages = [\n    {\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"Initial request\"},\n    {\"role\": \"assistant\", \"content\": \"\", \"tool_calls\": tool_calls},\n    {\"role\": \"tool\", \"content\": tool_output, \"tool_call_id\": tool_call_id},\n    {\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"Now format this as JSON schema\"}\n]\n```\n\n**3. Fallback Pattern**\n```python\ntry:\n    # Try structured output first\n    response = client.beta.chat.completions.parse(\n        model=\"gpt-4\",\n        messages=messages,\n        response_format=YourSchema\n    )\n    return response.choices[0].message.parsed\nexcept Exception as e:\n    # Fallback to text format\n    response = client.chat.completions.create(\n        model=\"gpt-4\",\n        messages=messages + [\n            {\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"Format as JSON matching this schema: ...\"}\n        ]\n    )\n    return json.loads(response.choices[0].message.content)\n```\n\nCould you share more details about:\n- What specific error you're encountering with structured outputs?\n- Your JSON schema/Pydantic model?\n- How you're integrating with the MCP server?\n\nThis would help me provide more targeted assistance!",

Generate a final response in a specific JSON schema\n\nAnd you mentioned it works when using `text` format.\n\nHere are some suggestions for making this work reliably:\n\n## 1. Structured Tool Output Flow\n\n```python\n# Example flow\nasync def process_with_tool(prompt):\n    # Step 1: Call MCP tool\n    tool_output = await mcp_server.call_tool(\"your_tool\", params)\n    \n    # Step 2: Incorporate tool output into prompt\n    enhanced_prompt = f\"\"\"\n    Consider this information: {tool_output}\n    \n    Based on the above, {original_prompt}\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # Step 3: Parse with schema\n    response = await openai.response.parse(\n        model=\"gpt-4\",\n        messages=[{\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": enhanced_prompt}],\n        response_format=your_json_schema\n    )\n```\n\n## 2. JSON Schema Format\n\nMake sure your JSON schema is properly formatted:\n\n```python\nresponse_format = {\n    \"type\": \"json_schema\",\n    \"json_schema\": {\n        \"name\": \"your_response\",\n        \"strict\": True,\n        \"schema\": {\n            \"type\": \"object\",\n            \"properties\": {\n                \"field1\": {\"type\": \"string\"},\n                \"field2\": {\"type\": \"number\"}\n            },\n            \"required\": [\"field1\", \"field2\"]\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\n## 3. Working with Text vs JSON\n\nIf it works with text format but not JSON, consider:\n\n- Converting tool output to string before including in prompt\n- Using `json.dumps()` for complex objects\n- Ensuring no special characters break the JSON parsing\n\nWould you like me to help debug a specific error you're encountering, or would you like to see a complete example implementation?",

For example:\n  process --input \"Line 1\\nLine 2: \\\"Special characters\\\"\"  \n\n• The --verbose flag can help you debug by showing intermediate steps. This is invaluable if you need to see how your data is handled before generating a final output.\n\n• If you need to ensure no changes are made to critical systems or data (e.g., in a production-like environment), use --dry-run first to verify behavior.\n\n• You mentioned leveraging AI output to produce or transform JSON data. In that scenario, you might chain this command’s output with other tools or scripts that parse JSON. For example:\n    process --input \"Desired text\" --verbose | jq .\n\n• For advanced usage involving AI (e.g., feeding partial output from your own scripts into an AI model), consider using a pipeline:\n    script-that-prepares-input | process --verbose | script-that-uses-output\n\nThese guidelines should help you effectively use the “process” command for a variety of scenarios—whether you’re simply passing a string, automating a pipeline, or integrating with AI-driven tasks.",

(your message seems to be cut off here).\n\n---\n\n**What does your schema currently allow?**\n- It lets you send a string input and receive a success flag + a message.\n\n---\n\n## Recommendations & Clarifications\n\n### 1. **Input type**\nIf your input is always a string (presumably some prompt or instruction), your schema is fine.  \nBut, if you need to pass structured data (like previous OpenAI output or intermediate results), you may want to use a custom input type:\n\n```graphql\ninput ProcessRequestInput {\n  prompt: String!\n  previousOutput: String\n  schema: String\n}\n```\n\nThen update your mutation:\n```graphql\ntype Mutation {\n  processRequest(input: ProcessRequestInput!): ProcessingResult\n}\n```\n\n### 2. **ProcessingResult**\nRight now, `message` is a string. If your output is a JSON object or needs to follow a schema, consider using a scalar type like `JSON`.  \nIf your GraphQL server supports it (e.g., Apollo), you can declare:\n\n```graphql\nscalar JSON\n\ntype ProcessingResult {\n  success: Boolean!\n  result: JSON\n  message: String\n}\n```\nThis allows you to return structured data.\n\n### 3. **Workflow Example**\n- **Client** calls `processRequest` with `input.prompt` (and optionally previous output).\n- **Server** (your MCP server) sends the prompt to OpenAI, possibly including previous output.\n- **Server** parses the OpenAI response (via `openai.response.parse`).\n- **Server** applies the final schema to the output.\n- **Server** returns the structured result in `ProcessingResult`.\n\n### 4. **Example of a full schema**\n```graphql\nscalar JSON\n\ninput ProcessRequestInput {\n  prompt: String!\n  previousOutput: String\n  schema: String\n}\n\ntype ProcessingResult {\n  success: Boolean!\n  result: JSON\n  message: String\n}\n\ntype Mutation {\n  processRequest(input: ProcessRequestInput!): ProcessingResult\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n## Next Steps / Questions\n\n- Do you want to pass intermediate outputs or schemas as part of your request?\n- Do you want the final output to be structured JSON?\n- Do you need to see an example resolver implementation for this flow?\n\n**Let me know your needs and I can provide a sample resolver or further refine the schema!**",

          "response": "Below is an example of how you might structure a GraphQL schema and resolver to handle an incoming request (via the MCP server) and process that request through OpenAI before returning a final JSON output. The key idea is to define a custom input type (rather than using a plain String!) if you want to pass more structured data to your resolver, and then to parse and transform the OpenAI response into your desired JSON schema before returning.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n1. GraphQL Schema Definition\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n# Define a custom input type so you can pass more structured data\ninput ProcessRequestInput {\n  # You can add additional fields here if needed\n  prompt: String!\n  # e.g. some identifier the MCP server might need\n  requestId: String\n}\n\ntype ProcessingResult {\n  success: Boolean!\n  # This can hold either plain text or a JSON string, depending on your need\n  message: String\n  # Optionally, if you want to store the final JSON in structured form, you can add more fields\n}\n\ntype Mutation {\n  processRequest(input: ProcessRequestInput!): ProcessingResult!\n}\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n2. Example Resolver Logic (Node.js / Apollo Server)\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nconst { openai } = require('openai'); // or however you're importing the OpenAI library\n\nconst resolvers = {\n  Mutation: {\n    processRequest: async (_, { input }) => {\n      const { prompt, requestId } = input;\n\n      try {\n        // 1. Send the prompt to OpenAI (example using text-completion; adjust as needed)\n        const openAIResponse = await openai.createCompletion({\n          model: 'text-davinci-003',\n          prompt: prompt,\n          max_tokens: 1000,\n        });\n\n        const rawText = openAIResponse.data.choices[0]?.text || '';\n\n        // 2. Parse / transform the OpenAI response\n        //    For example, if you want to produce a JSON schema from the response:\n        let finalJson;\n        try {\n          // If you’re using openai.response.parse or a library function that\n          // returns structured data (like a custom format), do your parsing here:\n          finalJson = JSON.parse(rawText);\n        } catch (err) {\n          // If the response is not strictly valid JSON, you could do more robust parsing\n          finalJson = { parsedContent: rawText.trim() };\n        }\n\n        // 3. Incorporate any additional logic. For instance:\n        //    - Use previously returned data from the MCP server\n        //    - Combine it with the AI-generated result\n        //    - Format it into your final JSON shape\n\n        // 4. Return in the shape required by your schema\n        return {\n          success: true,\n          message: JSON.stringify(finalJson), // or embed finalJson directly if you prefer\n        };\n      } catch (error) {\n        // Gracefully handle errors\n        return {\n          success: false,\n          message: `Error processing request: ${error.message}`,\n        };\n      }\n    },\n  },\n};\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n3. Notes and Tips\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n1. If you need multi-line text or a complex payload as input, defining a custom input type and sending it as a JSON string (or separate fields) can help. For example:  \n   mutation {\n     processRequest(input: {\n       prompt: \"\"\"\n         Your long text prompt here...\n       \"\"\",\n       requestId: \"abc123\"\n     }) {\n       success\n       message\n     }\n   }\n\n2. When returning data, you can either return raw text in \"message\" or store JSON in \"message\" by stringifying it. If you prefer a fully structured type, update your GraphQL schema’s ProcessingResult to contain more granular fields, or even create a nested type:\n   type ProcessingResult {\n     success: Boolean!\n     parsedData: YourNestedType\n   }\n\n3. The key to having “the AI consider the output before making the final output” is typically to:\n   • Make multiple OpenAI calls in sequence and feed the result of the first into the next (a “chain”).\n   • Or parse the first result, combine with any external data (MCP server output), and feed that combination back into a second OpenAI call.\n\n4. If your workflow “only works whenever I use text: format: ‘…’,” ensure your prompt strings are escaped properly for GraphQL and that any specialized formatting (e.g., JSON inside JSON) is carefully handled.  \n\nThis approach should let you generate a structured response from OpenAI, incorporate other data or logic from your MCP server, and expose the final result through GraphQL in a predictable format. Adjust the details to match your exact use case and the data structures you expect from OpenAI.",

          "response": "Below is an explanation of your schema along with some ideas on how you might integrate it with your MCP server and OpenAI response parser. Feel free to clarify or ask further questions if more details are needed.\n\n──────────────────────────────\nUnderstanding Your GraphQL Schema\n\nYour schema defines a mutation called processRequest that accepts a required input string and returns a ProcessingResult. The ProcessingResult type has two fields:\n\n• success (Boolean!) – Indicates whether the operation was completed successfully.\n• message (String) – Provides additional information, such as the response or an error message.\n\nThe schema looks like this:\n\n type Mutation {\n  processRequest(input: String!): ProcessingResult\n }\n\n type ProcessingResult {\n  success: Boolean!\n  message: String\n }\n\n──────────────────────────────\nThe Integration Context\n\nFrom your description it appears you’re trying to do the following:\n1. Use an MCP (Message Control Protocol?) server as part of your backend workflow.\n2. Use the OpenAI responses API along with a parser (openai.response.parse) to first get a “tool output.”\n3. Then have the AI consider that tool output in order to produce a final output in a specific JSON schema.\n\nYou mentioned that “It works whenever I use text: format: ‘…”, which suggests that when you explicitly provide or format the text input in a certain way, the output matches your expectation. The challenge seems to lie in getting the AI to produce an output following your JSON schema when the tool output is used as part of the prompt.\n\n──────────────────────────────\nStrategies to Consider\n\nHere are a few strategies to help achieve the desired result:\n\n1. Clarify the Prompt Instructions:\n • When calling the OpenAI API (or your openai.response.parse function), make sure the prompt instructs the model explicitly to:\n  – Produce only valid JSON.\n  – Follow a strict defined JSON format.\n Example instruction: “Please respond with only valid JSON that matches the following schema: { 'result': string, 'status': number }”\n\n2. Two-Step Process:\n • First, get the tool output. This could be some contextual or intermediate result obtained from your MCP server or other logic.\n • Then, feed that output into a second OpenAI API call where your prompt tells the model to consider that output and produce a final answer strictly according to your JSON schema.\n Example pseudocode:\n  a. toolOutput = openai.response.parse({ text: input, format: \"intermediate format instructions\" })\n  b. finalOutput = openai.response.parse({ text: toolOutput, format: \"final JSON schema instructions\" })\n\n3. Validate the Output:\n • Before sending the final result as the processing result in your GraphQL mutation, parse/validate the JSON. You might include try/catch logic:\n  – If parsing or schema validation fails, return success: false with an explanatory message.\n  – Otherwise, return success: true and include the parsed output in message.\n\n4. GraphQL Resolver Example:\nBelow is a simplified pseudocode example of what your resolver might look like:\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------\nasync function processRequestResolver(parent, args, context) {\n  const { input } = args;\n\n  try {\n    // Step 1: Obtain the tool output from your MCP server or a first OpenAI call.\n    const toolOutput = await callOpenAI({\n      // Using your openai.response.parse wrapper logic\n      text: input,\n      format: \"please produce an intermediate output\"\n    });\n\n    // Step 2: Use toolOutput in a follow-up prompt for final JSON schema output.\n    const finalOutput = await callOpenAI({\n      text: toolOutput,\n      format: \"please produce output in strictly valid JSON format matching: { \\\"result\\\": <string>, \\\"status\\\": <number> }\"\n    });\n\n    // Step 3: Validate the final output is proper JSON and matches your schema.\n    let parsedOutput;\n    try {\n      parsedOutput = JSON.parse(finalOutput);\n      // Optionally validate parsedOutput here against your expected schema.\n    } catch (parseError) {\n      return { success: false, message: \"Invalid JSON output: \" + parseError.message };\n    }\n\n    // Return the validated output as message (or another field if needed).\n    return { success: true, message: JSON.stringify(parsedOutput) };\n  } catch (error) {\n    // Error handling: return a failed ProcessingResult with error message.\n    return { success: false, message: error.message };\n  }\n}\n\nfunction callOpenAI({ text, format }) {\n  // This function wraps your call to openai.response.parse or similar API.\n  // It should pass the appropriate instructions and return the AI's output.\n  // Implementation details depend on your existing code.\n  return openai.response.parse({ text, format });\n}\n-----------------------------------------------------------\n\n──────────────────────────────\nSummary\n\n• Your GraphQL schema is correctly defined.\n• The key challenge is ensuring that when you pass the tool output to the AI, it understands the context and strictly follows a JSON schema in its final output.\n• Clear prompt instructions, a two-step process, and proper validation are essential to help the AI produce the output you need.\n\nIf you experience issues when you don’t use your predefined “text:” format, the problem might lie in ambiguous instructions or lack of strict output format enforcement in the prompt. Adjusting your prompt and/or applying post-processing validation should help.\n\nLet me know if you need more details or further assistance with any part of the integration!",
