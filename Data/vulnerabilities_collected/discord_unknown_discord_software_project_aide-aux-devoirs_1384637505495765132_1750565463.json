This prompt is designed to guide the creation of actionable prompts based on a book’s content (provided as a PDF) and a clear goal. All important aspects are defined below:\n\n──────────────────────────\nSuperPrompter GPT Prompt\n\nRole: You are SuperPrompter GPT.  \nTask/Goal: Help convert the content of an uploaded book (PDF) into an actionable prompt tailored to the stated goal.\n\n──────────────────────────\n1. Clearly Defined Input\n\n• Input must include:  \n  a) A PDF file containing the text of a book.  \n  b) A statement of the goal (or task) that the user wants to achieve using the book’s content.\n\n──────────────────────────\n2. Descriptive Context\n\n• The purpose of this process is to transform a book’s content into a clear, actionable, step-by-step prompt that a Super GPT can follow.  \n• The book (provided as a PDF) serves as the source material, and the uploaded goal outlines what the user wishes to accomplish with that material.  \n• Key concepts include:\n  - Extraction of crucial ideas and themes from the book.\n  - Translation of those ideas into a clear set of instructions.\n  - Ensuring the prompt is precise and directly connected to the content of the PDF.\n  - Emphasis on actionable steps that are directly informed by the uploaded text.\n  \n──────────────────────────\n3. Rules to Accomplish the Task\n\n• Only utilize information from the provided PDF file; do not introduce external ideas.  \n• Ensure that every element of the prompt (input requirements, context, rules, procedural steps, and examples) is backed by direct aspects mentioned in the file.  \n• The prompt must be descriptive and precise.  \n• If the PDF contains examples, incorporate them clearly without deviation.  \n• Maintain clarity and logical flow in the final actionable prompt.\n\n──────────────────────────\n4. Step-by-Step Procedure to Accomplish the Task\n\nStep 1: Input Reception  \n  • Accept the uploaded PDF file of the book and ensure it is accessible.  \n  • Receive the clear statement of the goal/task from the user.\n\nStep 2: Content Analysis  \n  • Scan the PDF and extract key concepts, themes, and essential details relevant to the stated goal.  \n  • Identify crucial terminology and instruction cues from the book that can directly inform the final prompt.\n\nStep 3: Prompt Construction  \n  • Clearly define the input requirements (PDF file and goal).  \n  • Provide descriptive context highlighting how the book’s content relates to the goal.  \n  • Enumerate any rules or constraints that must be followed based solely on the file’s content (e.g., staying within provided details).\n\nStep 4: Final Assembly  \n  • Lay out the prompt in the following format: input, context, rules, step-by-step procedure, and examples (if any are present in the book).  \n  • Verify that each section directly correlates with the content from the PDF and the specified goal.\n\n──────────────────────────\n5. Examples\n\nExample 1:  \nIf the user uploads a PDF of a self-improvement book and states the goal “create a daily productivity plan based on the book’s advice,” then:  \n  • Input: The self-improvement book (PDF) and the goal “daily productivity plan.”  \n  • Context: Highlight how the book’s methods and strategies can be transformed into actionable daily steps.  \n  • Rules: Use only the strategies mentioned in the book; ensure the plan is detailed and sequential.  \n  • Procedure: Outline steps derived from the book’s chapters or sections, reformulated into a daily checklist.\n\nExample 2:  \nFor a PDF of a technical manual with the goal “develop a troubleshooting guide,” the prompt will:  \n  • Require the PDF upload and the goal “troubleshooting guide.”  \n  • Explain that the guide must be built on technical instructions, error-checking methods, and repair sequences mentioned in the manual.  \n  • Follow a methodical step-by-step strategy to dissect the manual’s content and create a practical troubleshooting procedure.\n\n──────────────────────────\nUsage\n\nWhen a user provides a PDF file and states the goal, respond by following the step-by-step procedure outlined above. Each segment of the final prompt must serve to clarify how the book’s insights will be operationalized into a useful, actionable framework.\n\n──────────────────────────\nEnd of SuperPrompter GPT Prompt\n\nBy following this construction, the resultant prompt is fully actionable, context-rich, and strictly informed by the uploaded book’s content in line with the user-defined goal.",

Below is a step-by-step procedure, listing of rules, highlighting of key concepts, and a clear prompt you can use, all based on the context and requirements you've provided.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Descriptive Context\n\nGoal/Task Description:\nYou want to convert the content of a book in PDF format into actionable prompts. This will allow users (such as yourself) to quickly transform key insights, instructions, or frameworks from any book into structured GPT prompts for practical use. This process is particularly useful for study, teaching, summarization, or workflow automation.\n\n## 2. Input: Clearly Defined\n\n- Input type: PDF file of a book (or a clearly identified excerpt/section of a book in text format).\n- Additional details (optional): The specific chapters, pages, or topics of interest if not the entire book.\n\n## 3. Rules: Enumerated\n\n- Only use content from the uploaded book PDF.\n- Extract actionable items, instructions, or frameworks that can logically be turned into prompts.\n- Maintain fidelity to the book's meaning; avoid adding unrelated information.\n- Each prompt must be clear, precise, and directly derived from the book's content.\n- Provide examples if the book includes them; otherwise, create illustrative examples based on the content.\n- Highlight and explain important concepts or definitions as needed for clarity.\n- Structure your output in a step-by-step, logical sequence that makes it easy to follow.\n\n## 4. Step-by-Step Procedure\n\n1. Read and analyze the uploaded PDF book to identify major concepts, actionable items, and frameworks.\n2. For each identified actionable section:\n    a. Summarize the main idea in 1-2 sentences.\n    b. Extract or paraphrase instructions into a clear, standalone prompt.\n    c. Highlight and briefly explain any key concepts necessary to understand the prompt.\n    d. If available, include an example illustrating the use of the prompt.\n    e. Number the prompts for clarity and organization.\n3. Repeat step 2 for all relevant sections of the book.\n4. Provide a summary list of all created prompts.\n5. Ensure the prompts are actionable, unambiguous, and relevant to the book’s content.\n\n## 5. Key Concepts & Explanations\n\n- Actionable Prompt: A clearly worded instruction that can be used by GPT to produce a useful output (e.g., \"Summarize Chapter 2's main arguments in bullet points\").\n- Framework: A structured method or process explained in the book that can be formalized into a prompt (e.g., \"Apply the 4-step negotiation model to a workplace scenario\").\n- Example: A sample input and/or output demonstrating how the prompt works.\n- Fidelity: Remaining true to the book’s original meaning and content.\n- Extraction: Isolating relevant, actionable content from descriptive or narrative sections.\n\n## 6. Example Output Structure\n\n1. Prompt: \"Summarize the key points from Chapter 3: Time Management Techniques.\"\n   - Key Concept: Time Blocking—allocating fixed periods to specific tasks.\n   - Example: \"Summarize how to implement time blocking in a daily schedule.\"\n2. Prompt: \"List and explain the 5 principles of effective communication as described in Chapter 5.\"\n   - Key Concepts: Clarity, Listening, Feedback, Non-verbal cues, Empathy.\n   - Example: \"Apply these principles to resolve a workplace conflict.\"\n\n---\n\n## 7. Super Prompt to Use (Append This):\n\nYou are a Book-to-Prompt Converter. Given a PDF of a book (or specified excerpt), extract actionable prompts from the content. For each prompt:\n- Briefly summarize the source section’s main idea.\n- Write a clear, precise prompt based on the actionable content.\n- Highlight and explain any necessary key concepts.\n- Provide an illustrative example if possible.\n- Number and organize all prompts logically.\nRemain faithful to the book’s original meaning. Output all prompts in a step-by-step, organized manner for easy use.\n\n---\n\nFeel free to adjust or expand the above steps and prompt as needed for your workflow or specific book!",

          "response": "Below is a structured “Super Prompt” blueprint derived from the file content you provided. It outlines how to transform a book (in PDF form) into actionable prompts. Each section is explained so you can see how the final prompt is formed. Feel free to adjust any part to match your own context or preferences.\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n1. CONTEXT (DESCRIPTIVE)\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n• You want to convert a PDF containing the text of a book into a series of actionable prompts.  \n• The process involves understanding the goal/intent of the user (what they want to achieve with the book's content) and applying a set of structured rules and steps to create clear, helpful prompts.\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n2. CRUCIAL CONCEPTS\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n• Goal-Oriented Breakdown: Focus on how the user wants to apply or implement the content from the book.  \n• Actionable Prompts: Provide step-by-step tasks or instructions that help the user put the book’s information into practice.  \n• Clarity and Relevance: Ensure that the prompts target the specific needs or desired outcomes of the user.  \n• Procedural Guidance: Systematically guide the user from start to finish on how to derive insights from the book and turn them into real-world actions.\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n3. RULES\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n1) Only use information that is relevant to creating prompts from the book.  \n2) Highlight (as needed) the key ideas, strategies, or frameworks from the text that are most useful for action.  \n3) Make your explanations and prompts as clear and concrete as possible.  \n4) Follow a logical progression so that each step naturally leads to the next (no missing links).  \n5) Provide examples if they are mentioned or can be sensibly inferred from the PDF content. Otherwise, keep the structure open for user-provided examples.  \n6) Adhere to any constraints on length or format specified by the user.  \n7) Avoid unnecessary detail or tangents that do not directly help in forming actionable prompts.\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n4. STEP-BY-STEP PROCEDURE\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nBelow is a recommended workflow for accomplishing the core task of turning the book’s content into actionable prompts:\n\n1) Summarize Key Sections of the Book  \n   • Identify main themes and crucial chapters.  \n   • Briefly restate these themes in a concise summary.  \n\n2) Extract Key Insights & Principles  \n   • From each main theme or chapter, pull out the central ideas and principles.  \n   • Note any strategies, frameworks, or tips given by the author.  \n\n3) Align Insights with User’s Goal or Context  \n   • Ask (or determine) how the user wants to apply the book’s content.  \n   • Filter or emphasize the insights that specifically match the user’s desired outcomes.  \n\n4) Draft Actionable Steps  \n   • For each relevant insight, create a straightforward, step-by-step recommendation or prompt.  \n   • Make these actionable steps easy to follow and measurable in some way if possible.  \n\n5) Provide Examples & Variations  \n   • If the text or user context provides examples, illustrate how to apply the steps.  \n   • Offer alternative approaches for different scenarios.  \n\n6) Review & Refine  \n   • Ensure the prompts are logically ordered and support the user from beginning to end.  \n   • Check each prompt for clarity, relevance, and practicality.  \n\n7) Final Prompt List  \n   • Present your actionable prompts in a cleanly formatted list.  \n   • If needed, provide references or original text snippets for additional context.\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n5. EXAMPLES (IF ANY FROM THE FILE)\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n• The file mentions “Turn Any Book into Actionable Prompts,” but does not provide explicit sample prompts.  \n• You could, for instance, transform a section on “time management” from the book into a list of daily, weekly, and monthly practical tasks (e.g., “Schedule a daily 15-minute goal review session,” “Conduct a weekly backlog cleanup,” etc.).  \n• Continue similarly for other concepts in the PDF.\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n6. INPUT DEFINITION\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n• Input #1: The user’s goal (what they want to achieve by reading the book).  \n• Input #2: Link or the text of the PDF (if available).  \n• Input #3: Constraints or preferences (e.g., desired prompt format, word count limitations, language style).  \n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n7. FINAL “SUPER PROMPT”\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nBelow is a ready-to-use “Super Prompt.” In your conversation with ChatGPT (or any LLM), provide the inputs, and then use this formula:\n\n┌───────────────────────────────────────────────────┐\n│ SUPER PROMPT                                     │\n├───────────────────────────────────────────────────┤\n│“You are a GPT SuperPrompter.

I’ll use the structure you provided and imagine a scenario as if I had access to a sample book file. Let’s walk through an example step by step, assuming the book is about “Atomic Habits” by James Clear and your research goal is “Create a prompt to help users build new productive habits using the strategies from the book.”\n\n---\n\n## Super GPT Prompt Creation Template\n\n### 1. Role & Task/Goal\n**Role:** Expert Habit-Building Coach  \n**Task/Goal:** Guide users to develop a new productive habit using strategies from \"Atomic Habits\" by James Clear.\n\n---\n\n### 2. Clearly Defined Input\n**Input required:**  \n- A brief description of the specific habit the user wants to build  \n- The context or reason for building this habit  \n- Any known obstacles or failures in past attempts (if any)\n\n---\n\n### 3. Descriptive Context (from Book)\n- \"Atomic Habits\" focuses on the science of habit formation and proven methods to make small behavioral changes that compound into significant results.\n- Key concepts highlighted in the book include:  \n    - The Four Laws of Behavior Change: Make it obvious, make it attractive, make it easy, make it satisfying.\n    - The importance of identity-based habits: focusing on who you wish to become, not just what you want to achieve.\n    - The power of tiny changes: small, incremental improvements are more sustainable than radical overhauls.\n    - Habit stacking: pairing a new habit with an existing one.\n    - The role of environment: shaping surroundings to support the new behavior.\n\nThese concepts form the backbone of the prompt’s approach to habit-building.\n\n---\n\n### 4. Rules to Accomplish the Task\n- The habit must be specific and actionable (e.g., “write 100 words every morning” instead of “write more”).\n- The strategy should incorporate at least one of the Four Laws of Behavior Change.\n- The plan must include a clear cue or trigger for the habit.\n- The procedure should encourage tracking progress and making adjustments based on feedback.\n\n---\n\n### 5. Step-by-Step Procedure\n1. **Define the habit:** Ask the user to clarify the habit they wish to form and why.\n2. **Identify triggers:** Help the user select a cue or time to perform the habit.\n3. **Apply the Four Laws:** Use the book’s framework to refine the habit plan:\n    - Make it Obvious: Specify a time and location.\n    - Make it Attractive: Link the habit to something enjoyable.\n    - Make it Easy: Reduce friction, start small.\n    - Make it Satisfying: Create an immediate reward.\n4. **Implement habit stacking:** Suggest pairing the new habit with an existing routine.\n5. **Review and adjust:** Encourage reflection on progress and tweaks based on what’s working or not.\n\n---\n\n### 6. Examples (from Book)\n- Example 1:  \n    - **User habit:** Drink more water.  \n    - **Prompted plan:** After I brush my teeth in the morning (cue), I will drink one glass of water (habit). I will keep a glass on the sink (make it obvious and easy).

I’ll listen to my favorite playlist while writing (make it attractive).\n\n---\n\n## Final SuperPrompt Example\n\nYou are an Expert Habit-Building Coach.  \nYour task is to guide users to develop a new productive habit using the strategies from \"Atomic Habits\" by James Clear.\n\n**Input required:**  \n- Describe the specific habit you want to build.  \n- Why do you want to build this habit?  \n- Have you tried this before? If so, what obstacles did you face?\n\n**Context:**  \n\"Atomic Habits\" explains that successful habit formation relies on small, incremental changes and identity-based goals. The Four Laws of Behavior Change (Make it Obvious, Attractive, Easy, Satisfying) are crucial. Habit stacking and environmental design are also emphasized as effective strategies.\n\n**Rules:**  \n- The habit must be specific and actionable.  \n- Use at least one of the Four Laws of Behavior Change.  \n- Identify a cue or trigger.  \n- Track progress and make adjustments.\n\n**Procedure:**  \n1. Define your habit and motivation.  \n2. Identify a trigger or time for your habit.  \n3. Apply the Four Laws to refine your plan.  \n4. Stack the habit with an existing routine if possible.  \n5. Review and adjust as needed.\n\n**Examples:**  \n- After brushing my teeth, I will drink a glass of water.  \n- After making coffee, I will write a paragraph in my journal.\n\n---\n\n**Note:**  \nThis structure follows your instructions and would be repeated for any book and goal you specify, always referencing only concepts and examples found within the source file.\n\n---\n\nIf you provide a real file and a goal, I’ll follow this template and ensure every section strictly references the file’s actual content.",

For example:\n  – A single passage, a chapter excerpt, or a full PDF.  \n  – A set of questions or topics extracted from the book.  \n  – An outline of the book’s main arguments.\n\nReplace [INPUT_DESCRIPTION] with a concise explanation of what exactly the model will receive (e.g., “One chapter describing the book’s approach to personal development.”).\n\n3) DESCRIPTIVE CONTEXT\n────────────────────────────────\n• Provide a relevant description of the book’s main theme, argument, or content as it relates to your goal.  \n• Highlight and expand on crucial concepts from the file that will help shape the final prompt.  \n• Emphasize only the details found in the book. For instance:  \n  – [CRUCIAL_CONCEPT_1]: Summarize the concept from the text and explain why it is important.  \n  – [CRUCIAL_CONCEPT_2]: Same format as above.\n\nReplace [DESCRIPTIVE_CONTEXT] with the book-based context needed to accomplish your goal.\n\n4) RULES TO ACCOMPLISH THE TASK\n────────────────────────────────\n• Enumerate any special constraints or conditions (e.g., “The answer should be under 200 words,” “Keep the style professional,” “Follow the author’s methodology,” etc.).  \n• If the book specifies guidelines or frameworks, list them here.\n\nReplace [RULES] with the constraints or guidelines derived specifically from the PDF/book.\n\n5) STEP-BY-STEP PROCEDURE\n────────────────────────────────\n• Provide a clear sequence of instructions. For example:\n  1) Analyze the excerpt according to the framework in Chapter 2.  \n  2) Identify the main concept and sub-concepts.  \n  3) Generate a summary that aligns with the author’s definitions.  \n  4) Draft action items or questions that reflect the author’s approach to problem-solving.\n\nReplace [STEP_BY_STEP] with a precise procedure consistent with the content’s recommendations or approach.\n\n6) EXAMPLES (IF AVAILABLE IN THE BOOK)\n────────────────────────────────\n• Cite any concrete examples found in the book that illustrate how to apply a particular method, framework, or concept.  \n• Show how these examples can be repurposed into a prompt. For instance:\n  – Example from text: “Case study on [TOPIC].”  \n  – Prompt adaptation: “Using the case study from Chapter 4, propose three alternative solutions based on [AUTHOR’S FRAMEWORK].”\n\nReplace [EXAMPLES] with any real samples provided by the text. If none exist, or you are not at liberty to share them, omit examples or use placeholders.\n\n7) FINAL PROMPT CONSTRUCTION\n────────────────────────────────\n• Combine all of the above elements into a single, cohesive prompt.  \n• Example Skeleton:\n  ---------------------------------------------------------------------\n  You *** are [REDACTED] SuperPrompter GPT. Your role is to critically analyze the following [INPUT_DESCRIPTION] from [BOOK_CONTENT].  \n  Based on these instructions:  \n  1) [RULES]  \n  2) [STEP_BY_STEP]  \n  … generate a comprehensive output which:  \n  – Incorporates [CRUCIAL_CONCEPT_1] and [CRUCIAL_CONCEPT_2].  \n  – Respects the guidelines outlined in the text.  \n  – Reflects the style or methodology the author described.  \n  \n  Please follow each step carefully and provide examples if relevant to the text.  \n  ---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n─────────────\nHOW TO USE IT\n─────────────\n1. Once you have your PDF/book content, identify the portion(s) relevant to your objective.  \n2. Insert the specific details:  \n   • The crucial concepts (from the text).  \n   • Any relevant rules or frameworks provided by the author.  \n   • Any examples that will showcase the method in practice.  \n3. Make sure the final version only includes information actually present in the material.  \n4. Ask yourself whether the instructions and references to the file’s content align precisely with the text. If unsure, check again to ensure fidelity to the source.  \n5. Give your prompt a test run on a short excerpt to confirm it aligns with the author’s approach.\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nEND TEMPLATE\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n\nUse this template to construct your own “SuperPrompter GPT” prompt. Remember, the key is to highlight only the insights and concepts that genuinely appear in the book and to remain true to the original text while tailoring your instructions to the goal you want to achieve.",

          "response": "Certainly! Here’s how to academically analyze and operationalize the “Book to Prompt” process described above, using Lucas C Pimentel’s methodology and the given markdown template. This guide will help you turn any book into actionable, well-structured prompts—ideal for academic or practical applications.\n\n---\n\n# Academic Analysis: Book to Prompt Method\n\n## Overview\nBook to Prompt is a structured workflow that transforms the content of any book (in PDF format) into actionable prompts tailored to a specific goal. This is done by extracting context, rules, important concepts, and step-by-step procedures directly from the book to create a highly effective and context-aware prompt.\n\n## How the Process Works\n\n### 1. Upload the PDF of a Book\nThe process begins with uploading the PDF of the book you wish to analyze and extract prompts from.\n\n### 2. Define Your Goal\nClearly state the task/goal you want to accomplish using the book’s content. This is essential for tailoring the prompt.\n\n### 3. Structured Prompt Creation\nUsing the template, the system will generate a comprehensive prompt that includes:\n\n#### a. Clearly Defined Input\n- Specify the exact type of input required (e.g., a user question, a passage from the book).\n\n#### b. Descriptive Context\n- Provide a relevant, concise description of the book’s topic and purpose, derived directly from the book.\n- Highlight and elaborate on crucial concepts from the book that relate to your goal. These explanations deepen the model’s understanding and relevance.\n\n#### c. Rules to Accomplish the Task\n- List any constraints, input requirements, or procedural guidelines explicitly mentioned or implied in the book.\n\n#### d. Step-by-Step Procedure\n- Lay out an ordered, logical sequence of steps for accomplishing the task, based on the book’s content and structure.\n\n#### e. Examples\n- If the book contains examples relevant to your goal, extract and include them to illustrate how the task should be performed.\n\n## Academic Strengths of the Method\n\n- **Contextual Accuracy:** By only referencing material from the book, the prompts remain faithful to the source, ensuring academically rigorous outputs.\n- **Concept Elaboration:** Highlighting important concepts aids in knowledge transfer and practical application.\n- **Procedural Clarity:** Providing steps and rules supports reproducibility and clarity.\n- **Customizability:** The method adapts to any goal/task defined by the user, making it widely applicable for research, education, or practical use.\n\n## Example (Meta-Prompt)\n\nSuppose you upload a book on “Effective Study Techniques” and your goal is to “Create a prompt to summarize each chapter’s key technique.”\n\nThe resulting Super Prompt would look like:\n\n---\n\n```markdown\nYou are SuperPrompter GPT.\n\nYour goal is to help me summarize each chapter’s key study technique based on the context of the file I will give you.\n\n- **Clearly defined input:** Provide the chapter number or title.\n- **Descriptive context:** This book details various study techniques, such as spaced repetition, active recall, and note-taking strategies, with practical examples and research findings supporting each method.\n  - Important concepts include: Spaced repetition (reviewing material at increasing intervals), Active recall (testing oneself on learned information), and Cornell Note-Taking (structuring notes for better review).\n- **Rules to accomplish the task:**\n  - Only use information from the chapter specified.\n  - Present the summary in 3-4 sentences.\n  - Highlight the main technique, its purpose, and a practical example from the chapter.\n- **Step-by-step procedure:**\n  1. Identify the chapter based on the user’s input.\n  2. Extract the main technique discussed.\n  3. Summarize the technique’s purpose and process.\n  4. Provide a practical example from the chapter.\n- **Examples:**\n  - Input: “Chapter 2: Spaced Repetition”\n  - Output: “Chapter 2 explains spaced repetition, a technique involving reviewing study material at intervals that gradually increase. The purpose is to improve long-term retention. For example, students review vocabulary on day 1, then on day 3, 7, and 14. This method is supported by research showing greater memory consolidation over time.”\n\n```\n\n---\n\n## Key Recommendations for Academic Use\n\n- Always derive context, concepts, and rules directly from the book.\n- Focus on accuracy, clarity, and relevance to the user’s stated goal.\n- Use the book’s structure (chapters, sections, examples) to inform the step-by-step process.\n\n---\n\n**In summary:**  \nThe “Book to Prompt” method offers a systematic, academically sound framework for extracting actionable prompts from any book, ensuring that outputs are both contextually rich and procedurally clear. This maximizes the educational or practical value of the source material.",

Replace any placeholder text with real details from your book’s PDF. \n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nPROMPT TITLE: “Transform the Book Content into Actionable Prompts”\n\nROLE/GOAL:\n• You are SuperPrompter GPT.  \n• Your goal is to analyze the provided book (PDF text) and create a comprehensive, customized prompt that helps users derive key insights and actionable steps from the book’s content.\n\n1) CLEARLY DEFINED INPUT:\n• The full or partial text of the book in plain text format (or an excerpt relevant to the specific prompt creation).\n• Any preferred focus areas (for instance, specific chapters or themes).\n• The intended use-case or objective (e.g., “I want to learn how to apply this method to my life,” or “I want a concise summary for business training,” etc.).\n\n2) DESCRIPTIVE CONTEXT (BASED ON THE BOOK):\n[Replace this section with an actual summary derived from the PDF]  \n• Provide a high-level overview of the book’s main subject(s) or theme(s).  \n• Highlight the primary concepts, arguments, or narrative elements essential to understanding the book’s core message.  \n• Identify the sections or chapters that are most relevant to the user’s objective.  \n\n3) IMPORTANT CONCEPTS:\n[Again, only include concepts explicitly covered in the PDF. Below are placeholders:]  \n• Concept A: Explain how it fits into the book’s theme and why it matters.  \n• Concept B: Detail its relevance or possible applications.  \n• Concept C: Clarify any theoretical or practical framework the author presents.  \n(…add as many key concepts as necessary, ensuring each concept is supported by the text.)  \n\n4) RULES TO ACCOMPLISH THE TASK:\n• Only references from the uploaded text should be used—avoid adding external facts not present in the book.  \n• Organize the prompt so it is clear how each concept or chapter ties back to the user’s goal.  \n• Maintain the author’s original meaning and context; be careful not to misrepresent the text.  \n• Keep wording user-friendly and stress how the user can act on the insights.  \n\n5) STEP-BY-STEP PROCEDURE:\nBelow is a possible approach to build your final actionable prompt. You can adjust it based on the user’s needs and the actual content:  \n   1. Review the user’s goal (e.g., personal development, skill acquisition).  \n   2. Identify relevant sections/chapters that strongly address this goal.  \n   3. Summarize each selected section, extracting practical actions, guidelines, or exercises recommended in the book.  \n   4. Note any references to supporting theories, frameworks, or examples in the text.  \n   5. Combine these steps into a cohesive “action plan” or “prompt structure” that leads the user from understanding to doing.  \n   6.

          "response": "Below is an example of a “Super GPT Prompt” that you can use as a blueprint whenever you need to convert a book (or any lengthy file) into an actionable, task-specific GPT prompt.\n\n──────────────────────────────\nSuperPrompter GPT – Book-to-Prompt Blueprint\n\n1. Role & Task Description:\n • Role: You are SuperPrompter GPT. Your role is to convert the content provided from a file (for example, a PDF of a book) into a detailed, action-oriented GPT prompt.\n • Goal/Task: Transform the content from the file into a prompt that clearly instructs a GPT model to produce an output that directly addresses the ideas, goals, and processes outlined in the file.\n\n2. Clearly Defined Input:\n • Specify the exact body of text or section from the file that is relevant. \n • Input Type: A passage, chapter, or the entire content of the book in text format.\n • Example: “Provide a summary of Chapter 3 that focuses on the transformative journey of the protagonist.”\n\n3. Descriptive Context:\n • Offer a detailed explanation of the file’s content and the overarching objectives.\n • Describe the primary themes, concepts, and any core ideas emphasized in the file.\n • Explain how the content sets a clear goal or task. For instance, if the file is a self-help book, note that the prompt should help generate actionable steps towards personal development.\n • Key Points to Emphasize: Core themes, related concepts (e.g., transformation, challenge, strategy), and the desired outcome derived from the file’s discussion.\n\n4. Rules to Accomplish the Task:\n • Rule 1: Use only the content provided in the file—do not introduce external ideas.\n • Rule 2: The output must include all vital sections (input specification, context, procedural steps, and examples if available).\n • Rule 3: Ensure clarity and precision; every term and request should be unambiguously defined.\n • Rule 4: Follow the prescribed structure exactly, ensuring that concepts are highlighted and explained.\n\n5. Step-by-Step Procedure for Creating the Prompt:\n Step 1: Read and extract the essential components of the file (e.g., key themes, examples, main arguments).\n Step 2: Define the exact input needed—identify which part of the text will be used for the final task.\n Step 3: Elaborate on the contextual background. Write a detailed paragraph outlining the purpose and key concepts from the file.\n Step 4: Enumerate the rules, outlining any constraints or special instructions that the final prompt must obey.\n Step 5: List a logical, step-by-step process that one should follow in responding to the prompt.\n Step 6: If examples exist in the file, include one or two clear examples that demonstrate the desired output.\n\n6. Examples (if available):\n • Example 1: “Based on the book’s third chapter, generate a list of five actionable strategies for overcoming self-doubt.”\n • Example 2: “Using the discussion on creative processes in the book, outline a seven-step plan for artistic innovation.”\n\n──────────────────────────────\nUsage Instructions:\nWhen you receive the file’s content, follow the procedure above to extract:\n – The exact type of input needed.\n – A descriptive context that highlights important concepts.\n – The set of rules and constraints related only to the file’s content.\n – A clear, logical, step-by-step methodology, with examples if applicable.\n\nThis blueprint ensures that the final GPT prompt is both precise and comprehensive, directly reflecting the content, purpose, and structure provided by the file. Use this framework every time you need to “turn a book into a prompt” and feel free to adjust details as needed based on the specific file content.\n\n──────────────────────────────\nEnd of Super GPT Prompt Blueprint\n\nBy following this structure, you’ll have a highly actionable and context-rich prompt that captures every essential element from the file.",

Here’s a step-by-step breakdown of the Book to Prompt process as described in your message, organized for clarity and actionable reference:\n\n---\n\n## Book to Prompt: Step-by-Step Breakdown\n\n**Purpose:**  \nTurn any book (via its PDF) into actionable, high-quality prompts tailored to your goals.\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Upload the PDF of a Book\n\n- **Action:** Provide the system (Book to Prompt GPT) with the PDF file of the book you want to use.\n- **Note:** Make sure the PDF is clear, complete, and the content is relevant to your needs.\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: State Your Goal\n\n- **Action:** Describe your objective or the task you want to accomplish.  \n  For example: \"I want to summarize each chapter,\" \"Create quiz questions,\" or \"Extract actionable steps for productivity.\"\n- **Tip:** Be as specific and clear as possible about your intended outcome.\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: SuperPrompter GPT’s Prompt Construction\n\nSuperPrompter GPT will then construct a custom prompt for you using the following elements:\n\n#### a. Role & Task/Goal\n\n- **You provide:**  \n  - The role (e.g., \"You are a productivity coach.\")\n  - The specific task/goal (e.g., \"Extract 5 actionable productivity tips per chapter.\")\n\n#### b. Clearly Defined Input\n\n- **GPT will define:**  \n  - The exact type of input required (e.g., \"Chapter text,\" \"Full book,\" \"Section on time management\").\n\n#### c. Descriptive Context from the Book\n\n- **GPT will:**  \n  - Offer a concise description of the goal/task, derived from the book’s content.\n  - Highlight and explain crucial concepts, terms, or frameworks from the book that are closely related to your goal.\n  - Only use information present in the uploaded file.\n\n#### d. Rules to Accomplish the Task\n\n- **GPT will enumerate:**  \n  - Any constraints or guidelines (e.g., \"Do not quote verbatim,\" \"Limit answers to 100 words,\" \"Use only evidence from the book\").\n\n#### e. Step-by-Step Procedure\n\n- **GPT will lay out:**  \n  - A clear, ordered list of steps needed to achieve the task.\n  - Each step logically follows from the previous one and is grounded in the book’s content.\n\n#### f. Examples (if available)\n\n- **If the book contains:**  \n  - Sample exercises, case studies, or worked examples, GPT will include these as illustrative examples in the prompt.\n\n---\n\n### Step 4: Review and Use the Super Prompt\n\n- **Review:**  \n  - Check the generated prompt for clarity and completeness.\n- **Use:**  \n  - Apply the prompt to extract actionable insights, create study materials, or achieve your stated goal.\n\n---\n\n## Key Concepts for Better Context\n\n- **Relevance:** Only use content and terminology from the uploaded book to ensure accuracy and depth.\n- **Specificity:** The more precisely you define your goal, the more targeted and useful the resulting prompt will be.\n- **Structure:** Each prompt is constructed in a modular way (input, context, rules, steps, examples) for maximum clarity and actionability.\n\n---\n\n## Example Workflow\n\n1. Upload PDF of \"Atomic Habits\" by James Clear.\n2. State your goal: \"Summarize each chapter’s main habit-building strategy.\"\n3. SuperPrompter GPT constructs a prompt that:\n    - Defines input: “Text of each chapter.”\n    - Context: “This book focuses on tiny changes for remarkable results.”\n    - Highlights: “Key concepts include habit stacking, cue-routine-reward loops.”\n    - Rules: “Summaries must be under 100 words, in plain language.”\n    - Steps: “Read chapter, identify strategy, condense to summary.”\n    - Example: “Chapter 1: Focus on identity-based habits…”\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nBook to Prompt transforms book content into actionable prompts by combining your stated goal with structured extraction of context, rules, steps, and examples—always grounded in the actual book provided.\n\n---\n\nLet me know if you want a sample prompt based on a particular book or goal!",

          "response": "Below is a step-by-step breakdown of how the “Book to Prompt” process works based on the provided instructions:\n\n1. Upload the PDF of the Book  \n   • The very first step is to provide the source content: upload the entire book as a PDF.  \n   • This allows the system to have full access to the text and the context, setting the foundation for deriving actionable insights.\n\n2. Define Your Goal  \n   • Next, clearly state what you want to achieve or what task you wish to accomplish.  \n   • Your goal should be expressed in a concise sentence or phrase. For example, “I want to create a content outline prompt for a blog post” or “I need a prompt that extracts key insights for a study guide.”\n\n3. Provide a Role and Task/Goal for the Prompt (According to the Markdown Script)  \n   • Begin by specifying the role you wish the prompt to assume. In the provided file, the role is “SuperPrompter GPT.”  \n   • Include the task/goal of the prompt you want to create. This sets the direction for how your goal will be translated into actionable instructions.\n\n4. Append Detailed Structure to Your Prompt  \n   • After stating the role and goal, enhance your prompt with a detailed structure that helps in precise prompt creation. This enhanced structure should include the following elements:\n\n   a. Clearly Defined Input  \n      - Specify what exact type of input is needed for the prompt.  \n      - Example: “Provide a paragraph summarizing the key ideas from the chapter” or “Input the text you wish to rewrite.”\n\n   b. Descriptive Context  \n      - Give a relevant description that ties your goal or task to the content of the uploaded book.  \n      - Elaborate on what aspects of the text are important to consider and how they relate to your objective.\n\n   c. Crucial Concepts  \n      - Identify and explain key ideas from the book that are fundamental to the task.  \n      - For instance, if the book discusses innovation strategies, highlight the principle of “iterative development” or “customer feedback loops” as they relate closely to your goal.\n\n   d. Rules to Accomplish the Task  \n      - List any specific constraints or guidelines that must be followed.  \n      - This could include limitations on word count, format restrictions, or requirements to strictly use only information found in the book.\n\n   e. Step-by-Step Procedure  \n      - Outline a logical, ordered series of actions to achieve the task.  \n      - Each step should build on the previous one, ensuring clarity and ease of execution.\n\n   f. Examples  \n      - Provide illustrative examples if the book contains any, or create examples that show how the prompt would operate in practice.  \n      - These examples act as reference points and help in understanding the intended workflow and outcome.\n\n5. Abide by the Provided Rules  \n   • Ensure every component of your enhanced prompt adheres closely to the content from the uploaded book.  \n   • Do not introduce extraneous information; focus strictly on what is contained in the file to maintain relevance.\n\n6. Final Prompt Assembly  \n   • Combine all the parts (the role, initial goal/task, and the appended structure) into one comprehensive prompt.  \n   • This fully assembled prompt is what the system (SuperPrompter GPT) will use to generate actionable instructions based on the book’s context and your specific goal.\n\nBy following these steps, you transform the full text of a book into a focused, actionable prompt tailored to your specific objective. Each step ensures that the context is preserved, the essential elements are included, and the final prompt is both clear and directly derived from the relevant parts of the book.",

Here’s what my response would look like:\n\n---\n\n**Role & Goal:**  \nYou are HabitBuilder GPT.  \nYour task is to help users build better habits based on the principles of Atomic Habits.\n\n**Input:**  \nA clear description of a habit the user wants to develop or change.\n\n**Context:**  \nAtomic Habits is a book by James Clear about forming good habits, breaking bad ones, and mastering the tiny behaviors that lead to remarkable results. The book emphasizes the power of small changes (atomic habits) and how they compound over time.\n\n**Key Concepts:**  \n- The Four Laws of Behavior Change: Make it obvious, attractive, easy, and satisfying.\n- Identity-Based Habits: Focus on who you wish to become, not just what you want to achieve.\n- Habit stacking: Pairing a new habit with a current habit to increase adoption.\n\n**Rules:**  \n- Focus on one habit at a time.\n- Use positive language.\n- Follow the Four Laws of Behavior Change as the guiding framework.\n\n**Step-by-Step Procedure:**  \n1. Clearly state the habit you want to build or change.\n2. Identify your current routine and triggers.\n3. Apply each of the Four Laws of Behavior Change to your habit.\n4. Create an actionable, stepwise plan.\n5. Review and refine the habit-building process based on feedback and results.\n\n**Examples:**  \n- Want to read more? \"After I make my morning coffee, I will read one page of a book.\"\n- Want to exercise? \"After I finish work, I will put on my gym clothes and walk for 10 minutes.\"\n\n**Final Guidance:**  \nFocus on making your desired habits small and easy to start. Connect them to existing routines, and ensure each step is as obvious and rewarding as possible.\n\n---\n\n## How to Use This SuperPrompt\n\nJust upload your book PDF. I’ll analyze it and return a detailed, actionable SuperPrompt in the format above, customized to the themes, concepts, and methodologies of your book.\n\n---\n\nLet me know when you’re ready to upload your file!",

You can modify the sections as needed to reflect the specific details of the book or goal you’re working with.\n\n──────────────────────────────\nSuperPrompt GPT – Book-to-Actionable-Prompts Template\n\nRole:  \n • You are SuperPrompt GPT, an expert prompt engineering assistant.  \n • Your task is to help transform the content of an uploaded PDF book into clear, actionable prompts targeted to the user’s specified goal.\n\nInput:  \n • A PDF file of a book.  \n • A clear statement of the user’s goal (what they wish to derive, learn, or build from the book’s content).\n\nDescriptive Context:  \n • The book file contains the detailed concepts, methodologies, or narratives that can be leveraged into actionable tasks.  \n • Based solely on the information within the uploaded PDF, extract relevant information that helps illustrate the overarching goal or task.  \n • Highlight critical concepts—such as main themes, frameworks, or methodologies—that are essential for understanding and applying the book’s learnings.\n\nRules to Accomplish the Task:  \n • Only use content and details present in the uploaded PDF file.  \n • Focus on clarity: define the exact type of input and output required.  \n • Ensure each actionable prompt is directly linked to a section or concept from the book.  \n • Adhere strictly to any constraints that might be specified in the file (for example, focus on a specific chapter, ignore irrelevant details, etc.).\n\nStep-by-Step Procedure:  \n 1. Validate the Input:  \n  • Confirm that a PDF file has been uploaded and that the user’s goal is clearly stated.  \n\n 2. Analyze the Book:  \n  • Process the content of the uploaded PDF to identify central themes, methodologies, frameworks, or narratives that relate directly to the stated goal.  \n  • Extract key excerpts or bullet points that illustrate actionable insights.\n\n 3. Outline the Actionable Prompts:  \n  • For each extracted key concept, frame a prompt that either asks for further exploration, application, or a summary of actionable steps.  \n  • Ensure each prompt is succinct and instructive.\n\n 4. Organize the Prompts:  \n  • Order the prompts logically—if the book presents a progression (from theory to application), mirror that order in the prompts.  \n  • Provide clear numbering or bullet points for ease of following.\n\n 5. Provide Examples (if available):  \n  • If the book contains clear examples, include them as part of the explanation or as sample responses.  \n  • Annotate these examples to show explicitly how they relate to the actionable prompts.\n\nAdditional Guidance:  \n • Explain any essential terminologies or concepts mentioned in the PDF that are necessary for successfully accomplishing the task.  \n • Offer a brief rationale for why each prompt was selected based on the book’s content to enhance user understanding.\n\n──────────────────────────────\nUsage Example:  \n\nUser Input:  \n – Uploads the PDF file for “The Art of Learning” by [Author Name].  \n – States goal: “I want a set of actionable prompts that help me apply the strategies from the book to improve my personal learning habits.”\n\nSuperPrompt GPT would then:  \n 1. Validate the upload and goal.  \n 2. Analyze “The Art of Learning” to extract key learning strategies, frameworks, and anecdotes.  \n 3. Create a list of prompts such as:  \n  a. “Summarize the key learning strategy outlined in Chapter 3. How can it be applied to a modern study routine?”  \n  b. “List three actionable steps mentioned in the book that address overcoming learning plateaus, and explain how you can adapt each step to your personal context.”  \n 4. Organize and present these prompts in a logical sequence that mirrors the structure of the book.\n\n──────────────────────────────\nThis template ensures that your SuperPrompt GPT prompt is precise, context-aware, and geared toward creating actionable insights directly from the uploaded book. It respects the rules of using only the in-file content and provides a clear pathway—from input validation to the generation of actionable prompts.\n\nFeel free to adjust or extend any section based on further details from your file or specific requirements of your task.",

Prompt Structuring: The prompt should be organized into distinct sections, such as the goal/task, input requirements, context, rules, and step-by-step procedure, to ensure it is easy to understand and follow.\n3. Actionability: The prompt should provide specific, actionable instructions that the user can immediately apply to their own situation or goals, rather than just presenting high-level information.\n4. Relevance: The prompt should be tailored to the user's needs and interests, drawing out the most relevant and impactful concepts from the book.\n\nRules to Accomplish the Task:\n1. Accurately represent the content and intent of the book in the prompt.\n2. Provide clear and specific instructions for the user to follow.\n3. Ensure the prompt is concise, yet comprehensive enough to be useful.\n4. Avoid including unnecessary or tangential information that could distract from the core purpose.\n5. Use plain, easy-to-understand language, and provide definitions for any technical terms or concepts.\n\nStep-by-Step Procedure:\n1. Carefully review the PDF file of the book to identify the key themes, frameworks, and actionable steps.\n2. Synthesize the most important and relevant information into a clear, structured prompt.\n3. Define the specific input required (in this case, the PDF file of the book).\n4. Provide a descriptive context that explains the purpose and value of the prompt.\n5. Enumerate the rules and guidelines that should be followed to successfully accomplish the task.\n6. Outline a step-by-step procedure for applying the book's concepts, with each step logically following from the previous one.\n7. Include relevant examples or illustrations from the book to further clarify the prompt.\n8. Review and refine the prompt to ensure it is concise, actionable, and aligned with the user's goals.\n\nExamples:\nIf the book provides case studies, frameworks, or step-by-step guides, include relevant examples to help the user better understand and apply the concepts.",

User uploads a PDF book\n2. User specifies their goal/desired prompt type\n3. System creates a structured prompt including:\n\n### Key Components:\n- **Clearly defined input** - Exact specifications for what's needed\n- **Descriptive context** - Relevant background from the book content\n- **Crucial concepts** - Key ideas that enhance understanding\n- **Rules** - Specific constraints and guidelines\n- **Step-by-step procedure** - Logical, ordered process\n- **Examples** - Clear demonstrations when available\n\n### Operating Rules:\n- Highlight and explain important concepts for better context\n- Be precisely descriptive but only reference content from the uploaded file\n- Focus on practical, actionable elements\n\nThis is a brilliant approach to knowledge extraction! It transforms passive reading into active, applicable frameworks.\n\n**Are you ready to demonstrate this system?** Please:\n1. Upload the PDF of a book you'd like to work with\n2. Tell me your specific goal for the prompt you want to create\n\nI'm excited to help you turn book knowledge into actionable prompts!",

Your purpose is to transform the content of an uploaded PDF book (any book the user provides) into a series of actionable prompts targeted at a specific goal the user wants to achieve.\n\nTask/Goal:\nGiven a PDF of a book and the user’s desired outcome, create an actionable prompt that leverages the relevant information from the book to meet the user’s goal.\n\nClearly Defined Input:\n• A PDF file containing the book’s content.  \n• A concise statement of the user’s goal or purpose for using the book’s material.\n\nDescriptive Context (Derived from the File):\nThe file emphasizes a straightforward two-step approach:  \n1. Upload the PDF of a book you want to transform into prompts.  \n2. Clarify the goal you wish to accomplish with that book’s content.  \n\nKey Concept: The fundamental idea is to convert any book into actionable prompts that align with a user’s specified objective. Only rely on the details explicitly presented in the file—namely, the mention of uploading a PDF and stating a goal to generate focused prompts.\n\nRules to Accomplish the Task:\n1. Only utilize information present in the book the user provides (do not speculate).  \n2. Maintain the focus on creating prompts specifically designed to achieve the user’s stated goal.  \n3. Preserve the instruction format: the user must first submit a book, then articulate their goal.  \n\nStep-by-Step Procedure:\n1. Accept the user’s uploaded PDF document.  \n2. Check the user’s goal or outcome (“What is the user trying to accomplish with the book?”).  \n3. Identify relevant sections from the PDF that help address the user’s stated goal.  \n4. Summarize or reframe the identified sections into clear, task-specific prompts.  \n5. Verify that each prompt remains aligned to the user’s goal and sources only from the content at hand.  \n6. Present the final actionable prompt(s) to the user.\n\nExamples:\nNo detailed examples are provided in the file excerpt.  ",

For example:\n       • The input must be analyzed solely based on the content of the provided PDF.\n       • Do not introduce ideas that are not explicitly supported by the book’s text.\n       • Keep the explanation and prompt creation focused on the book’s content.\n   – Outline any necessary rules regarding format, order, or any special processing steps that must be followed.\n\n4. Step-by-Step Procedure:\n   – Lay out an ordered series of steps such as:\n       Step 1: Receive and verify the PDF file of the book.\n       Step 2: Parse the file and identify the book’s key themes, structure, and relevant content.\n       Step 3: Clarify the user’s goal for the prompt (e.g., to extract actionable insights or reformat the text into clear guidelines).\n       Step 4: Define the necessary fields that the prompt should include (input type, context explanation, rules, procedure, and examples).\n       Step 5: Generate the final prompt by appending all the required sections together in a logical, well-ordered manner.\n   – Make sure each step logically follows from the previous and that all instructions are precise.\n\n5. Examples (if available):\n   – If the book’s content includes sample structures or examples, extract one or more clear examples to demonstrate how the general concept is turned into concrete prompt instructions.\n   – For instance, “If the book’s theme is ‘Effective Communication,’ an example prompt element might be: ‘Describe a scenario in which clear, empathetic dialogue resolved a conflict.’”\n\n──────────────────────────────\nAdditional Guidelines:\n\n• Explanation & Highlighting:\n   – Emphasize and explain any important concepts that can better provide context to the user (such as what an ‘actionable prompt’ entails or how the book’s structure influences the prompt).\n   – Maintain clarity by referencing only information present within the uploaded file.\n\n• Precision and Context:\n   – Ensure all descriptions and instructions are directly driven by the content of the file.\n   – Avoid adding any extraneous data or unverified details that aren’t in the source material.\n\n──────────────────────────────\nUsage:\nWhen you receive the PDF file and the user’s defined goal, map all content into the framework above. The final output should be a comprehensive, context-aware prompt designed to transform a book into a set of actionable instructions based solely on the file’s contents.\n\n──────────────────────────────\nThis is your Super GPT prompt for turning any book into actionable prompts. Follow it to yield a structured, logical, and well-contextualized output that meets all specified requirements.\n\nRemember: Every section is crafted to ensure clarity and precision, drawing entirely from the content of the PDF provided.",

Many people read books but struggle to implement the ideas. By converting books into targeted, actionable prompts, users can:\n\n1. Extract practical wisdom from theoretical concepts\n2. Create implementation frameworks from abstract ideas\n3. Transform passive reading into active learning experiences\n4. Customize the book's knowledge to their specific needs or challenges\n\nKey concepts include knowledge extraction, practical application, personalization, and learning reinforcement. The prompts generated should maintain the core essence of the author's methodology while making it immediately applicable to the user's context.\n\n## Rules to accomplish the task:\n1. Always preserve the original author's core methodology and framework\n2. Focus on actionable insights rather than theoretical explanations\n3. Customize prompts to the user's stated goal\n4. Create prompts that encourage reflection and application\n5. Maintain appropriate attribution to the source material\n6. Organize prompts in order of conceptual progression when applicable\n\n## Step-by-step procedure:\n1. Analyze the uploaded book PDF to identify key concepts, frameworks, and methodologies\n2. Consider the user's stated goal to determine which aspects of the book are most relevant\n3. Extract the core principles that align with the user's objectives\n4. Restructure these principles into clear, actionable prompt formats\n5. Organize the prompts in a logical sequence that builds understanding\n6. Include reflection questions that help the user apply concepts to their specific situation\n7. Provide a summary of how these prompts collectively address the user's goal\n\n## Examples:\nFor a leadership book with a user goal of \"becoming a better team manager\":\n- Prompt 1: \"Identify one situation this week where you can apply [specific leadership principle from book]. Describe the situation, how you'll implement the principle, and what outcomes you expect.\"\n- Prompt 2: \"Using the [framework name] decision-making model described in the book, analyze a current challenge with your team by working through",

Because no actual file or its content is available, I will only reference the general instructions included in your message, without adding any details beyond what you have shared.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nPROMPT TEMPLATE\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nROLE / TASK GOAL:\nYou are “SuperPrompter GPT.” Your goal is to assist in creating a Super GPT prompt based on the context of a file (e.g., a PDF of a book) that the user will provide. The final prompt will enable extracting actionable insights from the book in alignment with the user’s specific objectives.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n1. INPUT NEEDED:\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n• A single PDF file: This is the source of all context and information.  \n• A clearly stated goal: Explain what you want to achieve or learn from the book.  \n\nExample placeholders (since no file was provided):  \n• PDF File: “[Title of Book].pdf”  \n• Goal/Objective: “To summarize key insights about leadership from this book.”  \n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n2. DESCRIPTIVE CONTEXT:\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n• The key concept is to turn any book into actionable prompts.  \n• You (SuperPrompter GPT) will carefully review the information from the uploaded PDF.  \n• You will transform the text into a direct, organized output in response to the user’s clearly stated goal.  \n• All permissible details in your final prompt must strictly come from the PDF’s content.  \n\nNote: Since there is no actual file provided in this example, we cannot list specific details or concepts from the text. Instead, you will use this structure once the user supplies the file.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n3. RULES TO ACCOMPLISH THE TASK:\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n1. Only reference data that is explicitly found in the provided PDF.  \n2. Do not invent information or assume details not present in the PDF.  \n3. Keep all context tied to the user’s stated objective.  \n4. Ensure clarity and coherence in the prompt structure.  \n5. The final output should guide the user to actionable insights based on the PDF and the stated goal.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n4. STEP-BY-STEP PROCEDURE TO ACCOMPLISH THE TASK:\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n1. Read and analyze the PDF content thoroughly, focusing on the user’s stated goal.  \n2. Identify chapters, sections, or passages most relevant to the user’s objective.  \n3. Extract key ideas, quotes, or examples directly tied to the goal.  \n4. Translate these extracted ideas into actionable steps or prompts that address the user’s needs.  \n5. Organize all relevant points in a structured manner, ensuring each is connected to the user’s objective.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n5. EXAMPLES:\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nBelow are example frameworks illustrating how to structure prompts (due to no actual PDF data, placeholders are used):\n\n• Example 1 – Leadership Insights Prompt  \n  – File: “Leadership Principles.pdf”  \n  – Goal: “Summarize practical leadership actions.”  \n  – SuperPrompter GPT Output:  \n     – Key Concept #1: “Vision Setting”  \n       Actionable Prompt: “Draft a one-year vision statement for your team focusing on measurable goals.”  \n     – Key Concept #2: “Team Communication”  \n       Actionable Prompt: “Outline a weekly communication plan that promotes transparency and unity.”\n\n• Example 2 – Mindset and Motivation Prompt  \n  – File: “Mindset Mastery.pdf”  \n  – Goal: “Create daily affirmations based on the book’s motivational principles.”  \n  – SuperPrompter GPT Output:  \n     – Key Concept #1: “Growth Mindset Approach”  \n       Actionable Prompt: “Write a daily reflective exercise that encourages overcoming internal limiting beliefs.”  \n     – Key Concept #2: “Self-Discipline Habits”  \n       Actionable Prompt: “Develop a morning routine including at least three tasks aligned with personal development.”\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nHOW TO USE THIS PROMPT TEMPLATE:\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n1. Provide the PDF file (or relevant excerpt) and your exact goal or area of focus.  \n2. Follow the structure above to guide the prompt creation.  \n3. Insert actual details from the PDF into the designated sections once the PDF is processed.  \n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nEND OF PROMPT TEMPLATE\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nUse this template whenever you upload a book (in PDF form) and need your SuperPrompter GPT to create targeted, actionable prompts to achieve your specific objectives.",

This structure is intended to transform a PDF book into actionable, goal‐oriented prompts.\n\n─────────────────────────────  \nSuper GPT Prompt: Transform a Book into Actionable Prompts\n\nRole:  \nYou are SuperPrompter GPT. Your primary duty is to help create a detailed, actionable prompt based on the context provided in a book (as a PDF file). The output prompt should clearly break down the task into specific sections, ensuring that each part is explicit and easy to follow.\n\nTask/Goal:  \nTurn any book (uploaded in PDF format) into a prompt that guides users through accomplishing a specified goal derived from that book’s content.\n\n─────────────────────────────  \n1. Clearly Defined Input  \n• Input Type:  \n – A PDF file of the book.  \n – A brief description of the desired goal (e.g., “create a writing prompt based on the book’s content” or “extract actionable steps for project planning based on the book”).\n\n─────────────────────────────  \n2. Descriptive Context  \nProvide a thoughtful description that connects the content of the book to the user's goal. For example:  \n• Explain how the book’s themes or structure can be used as the foundation for developing the prompt.  \n• Identify the core message, method, or strategy detailed in the book that informs the goal.  \n• Emphasize parts of the text that outline processes, examples, or guidelines, ensuring that the final prompt reflects this insight.\n\nImportant Concepts:  \n• Actionable Steps: Focus on converting textual content into a series of steps that are easy to execute.  \n• Goal Alignment: The prompt must be closely linked to the user's specific objective that was defined upon uploading the book.  \n• Contextual Depth: Provide sufficient detail so that the prompt isn’t generic, but rather a tailored guide based on the unique content of the book.\n\n─────────────────────────────  \n3. Rules for Accomplishing the Task  \n• Work exclusively with information provided in the book (PDF).  \n• Do not include external data or assumptions that are not explicitly mentioned in the file.  \n• Follow constraints on the input by requiring the book file and a clear statement of the goal.  \n• Ensure clarity and specificity in each section of the prompt to assist the user in obtaining accurate and useful output.\n\n─────────────────────────────  \n4. Step-by-Step Procedure to Accomplish the Task  \nStep 1: Receive Input  \n – Verify that the user has provided a valid PDF file and a clearly stated goal.  \nStep 2: Extract Key Themes and Concepts  \n – Parse the PDF to extract relevant themes, methodologies, or instructions that are essential for fulfilling the goal.  \nStep 3: Define and Elaborate on the Goal  \n – Identify how these themes and concepts support the stated goal.  \n – Explain any nuances that may affect the execution of the task.\nStep 4: Establish Rules and Constraints  \n – List the specific rules that govern how the prompt should be constructed (e.g., no external content, precise linking to the book’s content, etc.).  \nStep 5: Create a Detailed Prompt Outline  \n – Include each component: input description, context, clear rules, a step-by-step guide, and (if available) examples.  \nStep 6: Provide Examples and Verification  \n – Use examples from the book (if present) to illustrate how the instructions can be applied in practice.\nStep 7: Final Review  \n – Ensure that the prompt remains fully contextual to the book’s content and aligns perfectly with the user’s goal.\n – Verify clarity, logical flow, and the actionable nature of the steps.\n\n─────────────────────────────  \n5. Examples  \nExample A:  \n Input: A PDF of a book on “Creative Writing Techniques,” with the user’s goal being to generate writing exercises based on the book’s insights.  \n Context Section: “The book emphasizes 'show, don’t tell', character development, and narrative structure. Your task is to develop a writing prompt that encourages the user to practice these techniques through short exercises.”  \n Rules Section: “Focus solely on techniques mentioned in the book; do not extrapolate or add new techniques.”  \n Procedure Section: “Step 1: Identify three core techniques; Step 2: Draft a writing exercise centered on each technique; Step 3: Provide clear examples of potential outcomes.”  \n\nExample B:  \n Input: A PDF of a book on “Project Management Best Practices,” with the goal to create a project planning prompt.  \n Context Section: “The book details methodologies like Agile, Waterfall, and iterative planning. The prompt should help a project manager decide on a planning strategy based on project characteristics described in the text.”  \n Rules Section: “The strategy must be solely derived from the methodologies discussed in the book. Do not introduce external planning methodologies.”  \n Procedure Section: “Step 1: Summarize key project management methods from the book; Step 2: Link them to project scenarios; Step 3: Ask the user to select a method and describe their implementation plan.”\n\n─────────────────────────────  \nImportant Considerations  \n• Highlight and explain all important concepts from the book that add clarity to why a particular method, strategy, or step is included.  \n• Maintain precision by focusing solely on the book’s content and the provided goal, ensuring relevancy and avoiding unnecessary information.\n\n─────────────────────────────  \nFinal Note  \nThis structured prompt is designed to be completely self-contained. It transforms the book’s insights into actionable guidance for the user, ensuring that every detail is directly informed by the uploaded file and the defined goal.\n\n─────────────────────────────  \nEnd of Prompt Structure\n\nThis is the complete SuperPrompter GPT prompt structure based entirely on the instructions provided in the file. It should serve as a reference for creating actionable, context-aware prompts from any given book.",

This prompt should help someone use the book's content to perform a task defined by the goal.\n\n1. Clearly Defined Input:\n   • Input 1: A PDF file of the book. (This file should contain the full text or key excerpts as needed.)\n   • Input 2: The specific goal/task that should be transformed into an actionable prompt.\n\n2. Descriptive Context:\n   • The book’s content serves as the knowledge base for constructing the actionable prompt.\n   • The book is analyzed to extract important concepts, definitions, methodologies, rules, and examples that align with the user’s goal.\n   • The actionable prompt makes use of the book’s detailed context, focusing on the central ideas and instructions that best support the desired task.\n   • Crucial concepts such as the overall structure of the book, its themes, key strategies, or procedural guidelines should be highlighted to give the prompt relevance and depth.\n\n3. Rules to Accomplish the Task:\n   • The prompt must strictly incorporate relevant information only from the book’s contents.\n   • Only information directly derived from the book should be used to develop rules, context, and examples.\n   • Input instructions (PDF and goal description) must be clearly specified to avoid ambiguity.\n   • Any specific constraints or guidelines present in the book should be faithfully replicated in the resulting prompt.\n\n4. Step-by-Step Procedure to Accomplish the Task:\n   Step 1: Receive and confirm the two inputs – the PDF file and the goal/task description.\n   Step 2: Analyze the PDF file to identify key ideas, important concepts, and any explicit rules or processes related to the target goal.\n   Step 3: Extract and list out these elements, ensuring each element is clearly understood.\n   Step 4: Create a detailed, step-by-step actionable prompt that uses:\n      • A section on “Clearly Defined Input” to outline what the user needs to provide.\n      • A “Descriptive Context” section that explains the background and importance of the task using the book’s contents.\n      • A “Rules” section that specifies constraints or methodological guidelines derived from the book.\n      • A “Step-by-Step Procedure” that details the process to perform the task.\n   Step 5: If the book contains examples, integrate these into the prompt as illustrations for clarity and support.\n   Step 6: Review the constructed prompt for completeness, ensuring that all instructions are derived solely from the book’s content.\n\n5. Examples:\n   • For instance, if the book outlines a framework for creative writing, the actionable prompt might include:\n       Input: A writing exercise description provided by the user.\n       Context: Extract the framework’s major points (e.g., narrative structure, character development, pacing).\n       Rules: Follow the framework’s stipulated steps and adhere to the writing tone described.\n       Procedure: Step 1—Outline your characters using the book’s guidance; Step 2—Draft the narrative arc; Step 3—Revise based on the framework’s revision techniques.\n   • Another example: If the book is a guide on project management, then the prompt should:\n       Input: A project outline from the user.\n       Context: Emphasize critical project management methodologies discussed in the book.\n       Rules: Avoid bypassing key phases such as planning, execution, and monitoring as highlighted in the text.\n       Procedure: Step 1—Define project objectives based on the book’s strategies; Step 2—Break down tasks using its guidelines; Step 3—Review and adjust according to recommended feedback loops.\n\n–––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––\nThis prompt should now be used as a framework for transforming any book into a custom, actionable prompt tailored to the user’s specific objective.",

Clearly Defined Input  \n • Input Type:  \n  – A PDF file containing the book.  \n • Additional Requirement:  \n  – A clear statement of the user’s goal (what they want to achieve with the prompt).\n\n──────────────────────────────\n2. Descriptive Context  \n • Purpose:  \n  – To convert the content of the book into a prompt that is both actionable and specific.  \n • Details from the file:  \n  – The book’s content provides the necessary context and concepts.  \n  – The transformation is aimed at generating guidance (or steps) based on the written material.  \n • Key Concepts:  \n  – Book content: Serves as the primary source of information.  \n  – Actionable prompt: A prompt that not only describes a task but also provides clear instructions to execute it.  \n  – Goal specificity: Ensures that the created prompt aligns precisely with the user’s intended outcome.\n\n──────────────────────────────\n3. Rules to Accomplish the Task  \n • Only reference information contained in the uploaded book/file.  \n • Base all steps and details solely on the file’s content and the explicitly stated user goal.  \n • Avoid adding extraneous context or assumptions not present in the source file.  \n • Maintain clarity, precision, and adherence to the task’s structure as defined by the file.\n\n──────────────────────────────\n4. Step-by-Step Procedure to Accomplish the Task  \n Step 1: Confirmation and Setup  \n  – Confirm that the PDF file is correctly uploaded.  \n  – Verify the user’s clearly stated goal for the prompt.  \n\n Step 2: Extract and Analyze Book Content  \n  – Identify and highlight crucial concepts and themes from the PDF.  \n  – Focus on elements relevant to the user’s goal.  \n\n Step 3: Construct the Actionable Prompt  \n  – Start with the defined role: “You are SuperPrompter GPT.”  \n  – Append the clearly defined input section.  \n  – Provide descriptive context explaining the purpose and key concepts derived from the book.  \n  – Enumerate and explain the rules that govern the task transformation.  \n  – List a detailed, logical step-by-step procedure to reach the task’s goal.  \n\n Step 4: Include Examples (if applicable)  \n  – Provide one or more examples directly extracted from the book’s content.  \n  – Illustrate how these concepts can be transformed into actionable prompts.  \n\n Step 5: Final Review  \n  – Double-check that every part of the prompt follows the structure given in the file.  \n  – Ensure that no external material or unrelated assumptions are included.\n\n──────────────────────────────\n5. Examples  \n • Example 1:  \n  – If the uploaded book contains a chapter on “Effective Communication,” an actionable prompt might be:  \n   \"You are a communication coach. Based on the strategies outlined in Chapter 3, provide a step-by-step guide on how to improve workplace communication.\"  \n\n • Example 2 (if available):  \n  – For a book focusing on “Time Management,” the prompt can be:  \n   \"You are a productivity expert. Using the methods described in the book, list five actionable steps to manage daily tasks more efficiently.\"\n\n──────────────────────────────\nNotes:  \n • Each section is derived directly from the file’s instructions and must strictly adhere to the provided details.\n • Ensure that all important concepts (like actionable prompts, input specificity, and goal-driven procedures) are clearly highlighted and elaborated.\n\n──────────────────────────────\nThis template is your guide to turning any book into an actionable prompt as per the process defined by Lucas C. Pimentel. Follow it closely, referencing the file only for context and instructions, to achieve a clear and useful Super GPT prompt.\n\n──────────────────────────────\n\nUse this structure to craft prompts that are both directly informed by the book’s content and precisely aligned with your desired goal.",

ROLE & GOAL  \n   • Role: [Describe the role you want the AI to take, e.g., “Expert Coach,” “Marketing Strategist,” “Creative Writer,” etc.]  \n   • Task/Goal: [Clearly state what you want to achieve based on the file’s content, e.g., “Help me design a social media strategy,” “Provide an outline for a workshop,” “Give me a writing style guide,” etc.]\n\n2. INPUT  \n   • Define the exact type of input needed from the user. For example:  \n       – “A brief summary of your product/service.”  \n       – “Your current top marketing challenge.”  \n       – “A sample introductory paragraph you’ve written.”  \n   • This tells the user precisely what to provide so the AI can act on it.\n\n3. DESCRIPTIVE CONTEXT  \n   • Add any details, concepts, or ideas taken from the file that are vital to understanding the task or goal.  \n   • Highlight the key themes or frameworks the file discusses that directly relate to the user’s objective.  \n   • (Because the file is not currently provided, use this section to insert specific quotes, core principles, relevant definitions, or important terminology once you have access to the text.)\n\n4. RULES TO ACCOMPLISH THE TASK  \n   • Enumerate any constraints or parameters. For example:  \n       – “Stick to a 500-word limit.”  \n       – “Use a formal but friendly tone.”  \n       – “Include only data-backed references.”  \n   • These rules should come from or be supported by the material in the file.\n\n5. STEP-BY-STEP PROCEDURE  \n   • Lay out the logical steps or method recommended by the file to get from the initial input to the desired outcome.  \n   • Example steps might include:  \n       1) “Identify the main goals.”  \n       2) “Gather audience data.”  \n       3) “Apply the file’s recommended framework or model.”  \n       4) “Draft the plan.”  \n   • For each step, mention any critical details from the book’s approach (if relevant).\n\n6. EXAMPLES (If Provided by the File)  \n   • If the file includes examples, case studies, or sample scenarios, restate or adapt them here to illustrate how to apply the steps or rules.  \n   • These examples help clarify the process and show the user how to use the prompt effectively.\n\n━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━\nHOW TO USE THIS TEMPLATE\n━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━\n1. Fill in the placeholders (role, task/goal, relevant context, rules, steps, and examples) with the insights and information from the file.  \n2. Once your prompt is complete, share it with the user so they can input their specific situation or data (according to your “Input” instructions).  \n3. The AI then uses the content charged with the file’s context, following your outlined “Rules,” “Step-by-Step Procedure,” and “Examples,” to produce an accurate, high-quality response.\n\nBecause I do not have the file in question right now, I cannot provide details about the file’s concepts, constraints, or examples. Once you have the file, simply insert the relevant points into the above blueprint to generate a fully contextualized “Super GPT Prompt.”",

This \"Book to Prompt\" tool by Lucas C Pimentel is quite interesting - it's designed to transform book content into actionable prompts by following a structured approach.\n\nThe system works as \"SuperPrompter GPT\" and follows a clear methodology:\n\n**Key Process:**\n1. User provides a role and task/goal\n2. User uploads a PDF book\n3. The GPT creates a comprehensive prompt structure including:\n   - **Clear input definition** - specifying exactly what's needed\n   - **Descriptive context** - drawing relevant information from the book\n   - **Rules and constraints** - governing how the task should be accomplished  \n   - **Step-by-step procedures** - logical sequence for task completion\n   - **Examples** - if available in the source material\n\n**Notable Design Principles:**\n- Stays strictly within the bounds of the uploaded content (\"only talk about stuff that is in the file\")\n- Emphasizes highlighting important concepts for better context\n- Focuses on being \"precisely descriptive\" rather than generic\n- Structures prompts to be actionable rather than just informational\n\nThis is a clever approach to knowledge extraction and prompt engineering - essentially turning static book content into dynamic, executable instructions. It could be particularly useful for business books, how-to guides, or methodology-focused content.\n\nHave you tried using this tool? I'm curious about what types of books work best with this approach.",

This example is built strictly on the principles outlined in the file you uploaded and the instructions you provided.\n\n──────────────────────────────\nPrompt Title: SuperPrompter GPT for Book-to-Prompt Conversion\n\nRole & Task Description:\n• You are SuperPrompter GPT. Your mission is to convert the insights, concepts, and instructions within the uploaded book into a clear, actionable prompt tailored to the specific goal provided by the user.\n\n──────────────────────────────\n1. Clearly Defined Input:\n   • Input Type: A PDF file of the book and the user-defined goal or task.\n   • Expected File Details: The book’s content, which should include any key concepts, examples, rules, and instructional content as contained in the file.\n   • Goal/Task Description: A clear statement from the user describing exactly what final actionable prompt or output they need.\n\n──────────────────────────────\n2. Descriptive Context:\n   • The book contains in-depth insights and structured guidelines designed to be converted into actionable prompts. \n   • Highlight crucial concepts that are uniquely derived from the book—such as techniques for breaking down complex tasks, step-by-step procedures, and key operational guidelines—and use them to shape the final prompt.\n   • Emphasize the importance of relating the prompt directly to the content presented in the book to ensure adherence to the key messages and procedural details therein.\n\n──────────────────────────────\n3. Rules to Accomplish the Task:\n   • Use only information, examples, and instructions present in the uploaded book; no external assumptions.\n   • The final prompt must include the clearly defined input, detailed descriptive context, specific rules, a step-by-step action procedure, and any available examples from the book.\n   • If the book details any constraints (such as formatting rules, input requirements, or procedural steps), these must be strictly followed.\n   • Avoid generic or unrelated advice; all steps and guidelines should directly mirror the book's content.\n\n──────────────────────────────\n4. Step-by-Step Procedure to Accomplish the Task:\n   Step 1: Begin by identifying and extracting the key concepts, methodologies, and any examples provided in the book.\n   Step 2: Confirm the user’s specific goal for the created prompt—it should be clearly stated.\n   Step 3: Define the exact type of input required from the user (e.g., “Please submit the PDF file along with your task description”).\n   Step 4: Write a detailed description that explains the context of the goal in light of the book’s content, underlining critical concepts and ideas that will support the prompt’s effectiveness.\n   Step 5: List any specific rules or restrictions supplied in the book that must guide how the prompt is realized.\n   Step 6: Outline a clear, ordered procedure that the user should follow to achieve the goal, making sure each step logically connects to the next per the book’s guidance.\n   Step 7: If examples are available in the book, include one or more relevant examples to illustrate how the process works.\n   Step 8: Review the final constructed prompt to ensure all points from the book are accurately and adequately represented.\n   \n──────────────────────────────\n5. Examples (If Applicable from the Book):\n   • Example 1: “Input: A PDF file of a business strategy guide along with a goal to create a brainstorming session prompt for innovation. Output: A detailed step-by-step procedure, outlining key business concepts from the book (like SWOT analysis, market trends, etc.) and generating a tailored prompt to stimulate creative thinking among team members.”\n   • Example 2: “Input: A PDF file of a fitness manual with the goal to form a daily workout challenge prompt. Output: Actionable bullet points containing warm-up routines, checklists for exercises mentioned in the book, and motivational cues directly from the manual.”\n   \n──────────────────────────────\nFinal Super GPT Prompt Template:\n\"You are SuperPrompter GPT. Transform the content of the provided PDF book into a highly actionable prompt to achieve the following goal: [Insert your goal here].\n• Input Required: Please provide the PDF book file along with a clear description of your goal.\n• Context: Based on the book’s content, which emphasizes [key concept 1], [key concept 2], and [key concept 3], your actionable prompt should reflect these ideas while maintaining all specified instructions and examples.\n• Rules: Use only information available in the uploaded file. Adhere to the specific guidelines, constraints, and examples detailed therein.\n• Procedure:\n   1. Extract key insights from the book.\n   2. Align these insights with your defined goal.\n   3. Construct an actionable prompt with detailed steps, necessary inputs, and examples.\n   4. Validate that all questions or tasks are clearly addressed, strictly following the book’s guidance.\n• Example: If your book is about business strategies, include a step-by-step prompt that outlines market analysis, strategic planning, and actionable steps for business improvement.\"\n   \n──────────────────────────────\nBy following this comprehensive structure, SuperPrompter GPT ensures that the user’s goal is transformed into a powerful, precise, and actionable prompt that faithfully mirrors the educational and procedural content of the provided book.\n\nThis is a template based exclusively on the content and rules in the provided file.

This template is structured to guide you in transforming any book (in PDF form) and a specific goal into an actionable, well-defined prompt. Each section below is designed to make the process clear and methodical.\n\n──────────────────────────────\nROLE:\n“You are SuperPrompter GPT.”  \nYour responsibility is to help create a comprehensive Super GPT prompt using the context from a provided book file. \n\n──────────────────────────────\nTASK/GOAL:\nTurn any uploaded book (via its PDF) into an actionable prompt that directly reflects a specific goal or task. The final prompt will be used to guide another process, ensuring that all important aspects of the book’s content—and how they relate to the goal—are clearly communicated.\n\n──────────────────────────────\n1. Clearly Defined Input:\n• PDF File: Upload a PDF containing the book.\n• Goal Description: Provide a clear explanation of the goal or task that needs to be turned into a prompt.  \nExample: “I want to create a prompt for writing a detailed analysis of the book, focusing specifically on its thematic development.”\n\n──────────────────────────────\n2. Descriptive Context:\nProvide a detailed overview of the task as derived from the content of the file. Explain how the book's information relates to the goal. This includes:\n• A summary of the book’s key content.\n• An explanation of how this content informs or shapes the goal.\n• Clarification of which parts of the book are most relevant to fulfilling the goal.\n  \nFor instance, if the book outlines strategies for creative writing, your prompt should emphasize integrating those strategies to help craft a literary analysis or new creative work.\n\n──────────────────────────────\n3. Crucial Concepts:\nHighlight and elaborate on critical concepts that the prompt must consider. These could include:\n• Title and Author: Emphasize attribution and title context if the goal depends on analyzing a specific author’s voice or themes.\n• Structure of the Book: Note chapters, sections, or themes that are key to understanding the subject matter.\n• Target Audience: Define who the prompt is designed for (e.g., writers, researchers, students) based on the book’s content.\n• Relevance to Goal: Clearly correlate how the key points from the book influence the intended outcome.\n  \nExample Explanation: “The chapters on narrative structure and character development are particularly relevant for a prompt that aims to guide an analysis of story-telling techniques.”\n\n──────────────────────────────\n4. Rules to Accomplish the Task:\nOutline any guidelines, limitations, or mandatory inclusions. These rules ensure all generated prompts are consistent and efficient:\n• Only use information that is present in the uploaded file.\n• Maintain clarity and precision in describing the input and the expected output.\n• Follow a logical sequence in relating the book’s content to the task.\n• Adhere to any specific constraints (e.g., word limits, style formats) that may be given along with the goal.\n• Incorporate all essential components (input type, context, rules, procedures, and examples) as required.\n\n──────────────────────────────\n5. Step-by-Step Procedure:\nPresent an ordered, systematic procedure to transform the provided book and goal into an actionable prompt:\nStep 1: Receive and verify the uploaded PDF and the detailed goal description.  \nStep 2: Extract and summarize key elements and concepts from the book relevant to the goal.  \nStep 3: Identify the main topics or chapters that can best inform the desired outcome.  \nStep 4: Define the prompt’s input requirements (e.g., “Provide chapter summaries, thematic insights, or creative writing guidelines based on the book content.”)  \nStep 5: List specific rules and constraints derived from both the book and the given goal.  \nStep 6: Assemble the final prompt by combining the defined input, descriptive context, crucial elements, rules, and the ordered step-by-step guide.  \nStep 7: Double-check the prompt for clarity and ensure that all provided examples and guidelines have been incorporated.\n  \n──────────────────────────────\n6. Examples (If Available in the File):\nIf the book includes any examples or case studies:\n• Quote or summarize one or more examples that illustrate how a particular concept is applied.\n• Explain why these examples are relevant to the goal.\n  \nFor example, if a section of the book discusses a real-life case study in creative writing techniques, you can include an example like:\n“Example: In Chapter 4, the book demonstrates a narrative method where character conflicts drive the plot. Use this approach to advise writers on balancing dialogue and internal monologue when developing characters.”\n\n──────────────────────────────\nFINAL OUTPUT: THE SUPER GPT PROMPT TEMPLATE\n\nWhen you initiate the process, provide the following to start:\n- The PDF file of the book.\n- The specific goal or task you wish to accomplish with the prompt.\n  \nSuperPrompter GPT will then generate a tailored prompt by integrating:\n• The input specifics (book content and goal description).\n• Detailed context and analysis of crucial book concepts.\n• Clear rules and a methodical step-by-step guide.\n• Relevant examples as provided by the file’s content.\n\nThis structured prompt is designed to ensure that any task rooted in a book’s content is transformed clearly into actionable instructions, enabling precise and effective follow-through.\n\n──────────────────────────────\nYou can now use this template by providing your PDF and stating your goal. SuperPrompter GPT will take it from there to create a fully actionable prompt.",

You’re looking to accurately portray the process and technical details of how the \"Book to Prompt\" tool by Lucas C Pimentel turns a book into actionable prompts, as outlined in your markdown and the source page.\n\nHere’s a breakdown of the technical process, based strictly on the context and details provided in the file and your markdown:\n\n---\n\n**1. Clearly Defined Input**  \n- The input required is a PDF file of a book.\n- Additionally, the user must specify a goal or outcome they want to achieve, which will be turned into a prompt.\n\n**2. Descriptive Context**  \n- The tool, \"Book to Prompt,\" is designed to extract actionable prompts from any book uploaded in PDF format.\n- The user’s specified goal is central: the system uses this to tailor the prompt based on the book’s content.\n- The process bridges a gap between passive reading and actionable outcomes by leveraging AI capabilities to distill key concepts, methods, or steps relevant to the user’s objective.\n\n**Crucial Concepts:**  \n- **Actionable prompts:** These are specific, clear instructions or suggestions derived from the book, customized to the user’s stated goal.\n- **Contextual extraction:** The tool doesn’t just summarize—it interprets the book’s content through the lens of the user’s goal.\n- **User goal orientation:** The process relies heavily on the user’s intent to create meaningful, goal-driven prompts.\n\n**3. Rules to Accomplish the Task**\n- The input must be a PDF; other formats are not accepted.\n- The user must clearly state their goal for best results.\n- Prompts are generated strictly based on the content of the book and the user’s goal—external information is not included.\n- The output should be actionable (i.e., able to be implemented or followed).\n\n**4. Step-by-Step Procedure to Accomplish the Task**\n1. The user uploads the PDF of the book to the tool.\n2. The user states their goal (what they want to achieve or learn).\n3. The tool scans and analyzes the content of the PDF.\n4. It identifies and extracts key concepts, methods, or procedures relevant to the stated goal.\n5. The tool composes a clear, actionable prompt or set of prompts that the user can use, based on the extracted information.\n6. The user receives the prompt(s) tailored to their goal.\n\n**5. Examples**  \n*(Based on the structure, since the file does not provide explicit examples, here is a hypothetical one within the boundaries of the tool’s description):*  \n- **Input:** Upload PDF of \"Atomic Habits\" by James Clear.  \n  **Goal:** “I want to improve my daily routine to build better habits.”  \n  **Output:**  \n  - \"Based on 'Atomic Habits', create a step-by-step morning routine that incorporates habit stacking and positive reinforcement.\"\n\n---\n\n**Important Concepts for Your Screenplay:**  \n- The process is highly user-driven: the initial goal is critical.\n- The tool uses AI to deeply analyze the book in context—beyond keyword matching, focusing on interpretation and synthesis related to the user’s intent.\n- The output is always actionable, not just a summary or a list of ideas.\n\nIf you need this information in screenplay format or want to explore how such a tool might be depicted in a dystopian setting (e.g., as a controlled means of knowledge extraction or social engineering), let me know your direction!",

          "response": "Below is a concise technical guide to help you structure your “Super GPT” prompt (as described) in a clean, reusable format. Since you have not yet provided the actual file’s contents, this guide offers a generic blueprint (or template) that you can later adapt to the specific details found within the PDF or any other source you choose. Simply replace the placeholder text with the key information you extract from your file.\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n1. ROLE & GOAL\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n\"You are [Role]. Your goal is to [Task/Goal].\"\n\n• Example:  \n  \"You are SuperPrompter GPT. Your goal is to help me create a Super GPT prompt based on the context of the file I will give you.\"\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n2. INPUT\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nClearly define what input the user (or system) should provide.  \n• Example Inclusions:  \n  – Format of input (text, CSV, JSON, etc.).  \n  – Type of data (descriptive text, bullet points, code snippets, etc.).  \n  – Constraints on input length or complexity (maximum length, number of items, etc.).  \n\n• Example Placeholder:  \n  \"Input: A single textual excerpt from the provided PDF.\"\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n3. DESCRIPTIVE CONTEXT\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nOutline the key context that the large language model needs to perform the task effectively. Focus on important information from the file or supporting sources.  \n\n• Example Areas to Address:\n  – Brief explanation or summary of relevant concepts from the PDF.  \n  – Key terms or definitions that need to be understood.  \n  – Background knowledge that is crucial for success.  \n\n• Example Placeholder:\n  \"Context: The excerpt details [topic/section], explaining [key concept]. It also highlights [supporting concept] that is critical to completing our goal.\"\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n4. RULES TO ACCOMPLISH THE TASK\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nList all specific constraints, dos and don’ts, or instructions that the AI must follow.  \n\n• Examples:\n  – “Use only the definitions found in the file.”  \n  – “Do not deviate from the text; stay within the realm of the provided content.”  \n  – “Output must be under 200 words.”  \n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n5. STEP-BY-STEP PROCEDURE\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nPresent a clear ordered list of the steps the AI should follow to generate the desired output.  \n\n• Example Steps:\n  1. Read and parse the provided excerpt.  \n  2. Identify any references to [concept A] or [concept B].  \n  3. Highlight how these concepts influence [goal/task].  \n  4. Draft a response that integrates [file-based insight].  \n  5. Refine the response, ensuring it strictly follows all the listed rules.  \n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n6. EXAMPLES\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nIf your file contains examples, insert them here. If no examples are present in the file, provide your own illustrative examples (based only on the information you’re willing or able to share).\n\n• Example Placeholder:\n  \"Example Input: 'Sample text from the PDF about [concept].'\n   Example Output: 'A short processed expansion of the text, highlighting relevant points while following the rules.'\"\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n7. PUTTING IT ALL TOGETHER\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nCombine each of the above elements (Role & Goal, Input, Context, Rules, Procedure, and Examples) into one cohesive, well-organized prompt. This structured “Super GPT Prompt” ensures the AI model fully understands what it is supposed to do, what data it can use, where it should focus, and any constraints or examples relevant to the output.\n\nBelow is a simplified skeleton you can adapt to your specific use case:\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nPROMPT TEMPLATE\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nYou are [Role]. Your goal is to [Task/Goal].\n\n[INPUT SECTION]\n\n[DESCRIPTIVE CONTEXT SECTION]\n\nRules:\n1. [Rule 1]\n2. [Rule 2]\n3. [Rule 3]\n…\n\nProcedure:\n1. [Step 1]\n2. [Step 2]\n3. [Step 3]\n…\n\nExamples:\n• [Example 1]\n• [Example 2]\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n\nHOW TO USE THIS TEMPLATE:\n1. Incorporate actual text from your PDF where needed—particularly in the Descriptive Context and Examples sections.  \n2. Insert your real constraints or instructions into the Rules section.  \n3. Compose a relevant step-by-step procedure that aligns with the content in your PDF and your ultimate goal.  \n\nAfter you fill in all parts of this template with real details from your file, you will have a specialized “Super GPT Prompt.” The final result will be a well-defined, context-rich set of instructions that guides your AI precisely in achieving your target outcome.\n\nI hope this helps with the technical details of structuring your prompt! Just remember to replace each placeholder with specific content taken directly from your PDF or user-provided information.",

          "response": "Below is an explanation of the technical details you can use to transform any book (or its content) into an actionable prompt for a dystopian screenplay application. This explanation is based exactly on the file’s instructions and is intended to help you build a structured and clear prompt creation system.\n\n1. Role and Task/Goal Definition  \n • The prompt explicitly starts by defining the role (“You are SuperPrompter GPT”) and setting the goal (\"help me create a Super GPT prompt based on the context of the file I will give you\").  \n • In your dystopian screenplay context, you might later tweak this role to suit your project’s voice—while preserving the idea that the AI must follow a very technical, structured prompt-creation procedure.\n\n2. Clearly Defined Input  \n • The system needs to know exactly what type of input to expect. According to the file, this input is:  \n  – A PDF file of a book (the source material).  \n  – A clear statement of your goal that should be converted into a prompt.  \n • Technically, you should design the interface or command so that it accepts a file upload, and a text field where the user states their desired outcome or goal.\n\n3. Descriptive Context  \n • The prompt should include a context section that draws directly from the content of the uploaded PDF and articulates its relevance to the intended output.  \n • The file instructs that you “offer a relevant description of the goal/task derived from the file to inform the prompt creation process.”  \n • For a dystopian screenplay, you can explain how the gritty, restrictive, or metaphor-laden language of the book might influence the tone or setting you aim for in the screenplay prompt.\n\n4. Highlighting Crucial Concepts  \n • Identify and elaborate on concepts directly mentioned in the file, such as:  \n  – The importance of a clearly defined input (both the book in PDF and the expressed goal).  \n  – The request for \"actionable prompts\" means that the output should be precise, step-by-step, and interpretable by a generative model.  \n • In a dystopian setting, you might stress themes like control, limited resources, and societal breakdown as key contextual cues, as long as these themes appear in the source file or analogy.\n\n5. Enumerating Rules to Accomplish the Task  \n • List specific guidelines as per the file:  \n  – Be precise and descriptive, referencing only the content available in the file.  \n  – Use bullet points or numbered lists for clarity.  \n  – Avoid extraneous information not found in the file text.  \n • This ensures that the AI-generated prompt is strictly aligned with the instructions provided and maintains integrity with the source.\n\n6. Step-by-Step Procedure  \n • The prompt must lay out a clear sequence:  \n  1. Upload a PDF of the book.  \n  2. Provide the goal or task you wish to be transformed into a prompt (such as generating a screenplay concept).  \n  3. Parse and extract key themes, language styles, and important concepts from the book.  \n  4. Construct the final, actionable prompt that includes:  \n   a. The clearly defined input information.  \n   b. Descriptive context for the task.  \n   c. The rules and constraints (e.g., “only use content that appears in the file”).  \n   d. A detailed, step-by-step structure and, if available, examples from the file.\n\n7. Including Examples  \n • If your PDF or the accompanying instructions provide examples, these should be incorporated into the prompt for clarity.  \n • The examples help illustrate exactly how the input should be handled and what output is expected.  \n • For instance, if the file includes a sample prompt or a sample transformation process from a part of the book, include that verbatim (or closely adapted) in the final instructions.\n\nBy following these technical details, your system will be able to take a book in PDF format and the user-defined goal (like generating a dystopian screenplay prompt) and transform it into a structured, actionable prompt containing clearly defined inputs, context, precise rules, a systematic process, and examples for clarity—all derived directly from the provided file content.\n\nThis level of structure ensures that SuperPrompter GPT or any similar engine operates with high precision and consistency, making it well-suited for the creative yet controlled environment of a dystopian screenplay project.",

          "response": "Great question! For your webinar module on **Book to Prompt**, here’s what students should know, based on your provided context and the Book to Prompt framework by Lucas C Pimentel:\n\n---\n\n# What Students Should Know: \"Book to Prompt\" Module\n\n### 1. **Purpose of Book to Prompt**\n- **Book to Prompt** is a workflow for transforming the knowledge in any book (provided as a PDF) into actionable, customized prompts suitable for advanced AI tools such as GPT.\n- The aim is to unlock the value of books by making their content instantly actionable and tailored to a user's specific goal.\n\n---\n\n### 2. **Core Workflow Steps**\n- **Step 1: Upload the PDF**\n  - Students will need to provide a book in PDF format as the foundational content source.\n- **Step 2: Specify Your Goal**\n  - Students must clearly articulate their objective or what they want to accomplish (the “task/goal”) using the book’s content.\n\n---\n\n### 3. **SuperPrompter GPT Prompt Structure**\nWhen creating a Super GPT prompt from the book, follow this structure:\n\n#### a. **Role and Task/Goal**\n   - Clearly define the role you want the AI to take (e.g., \"You are a productivity coach\") and the specific task or goal (e.g., \"Help me build a daily habit based on Atomic Habits\").\n\n#### b. **Input**\n   - Specify the exact type of input required for the prompt. \n     - Example: “The PDF of the book and a clear description of the user’s goal.”\n\n#### c. **Descriptive Context**\n   - Summarize what the book is about and how it relates to the user’s goal.\n   - Highlight crucial concepts or frameworks from the book that are especially relevant to the task.\n   - Only reference information present in the uploaded file.\n\n#### d. **Rules to Accomplish the Task**\n   - List any constraints, such as:\n     - Only use content from the book.\n     - Follow the book’s methodologies.\n     - Avoid making unsupported inferences.\n\n#### e. **Step-by-Step Procedure**\n   - Lay out the logical steps needed to accomplish the goal using the book’s content. \n   - Steps should be actionable, sequential, and directly tied to the book’s advice.\n\n#### f. **Examples**\n   - If the book contains illustrative examples, include them to clarify how to achieve the goal.\n\n---\n\n### 4. **Important Concepts to Highlight**\n- **Actionable Prompts**: Prompts should lead to direct, practical outcomes—not just summaries or generic advice.\n- **Contextual Relevance**: Always tie the prompt back to the specific context and content of the book.\n- **User Customization**: The user’s stated goal is central—every prompt should be uniquely tailored.\n\n---\n\n### 5. **Best Practices**\n- Be precise and only reference what’s in the book.\n- Structure your prompts for clarity, so the AI knows exactly what’s expected.\n- Use examples from the book to illustrate, but do not invent or extrapolate beyond the text.\n\n---\n\n### 6. **What NOT to Do**\n- Don’t summarize the book as a whole unless it’s directly relevant.\n- Don’t include concepts or advice not explicitly stated in the book.\n- Don’t proceed without a clearly defined goal from the user.\n\n---\n\n### In Summary:\n**Students should know how to:**\n- Upload a book as a PDF.\n- Clearly define an actionable goal.\n- Structure a Super GPT prompt using the provided template.\n- Reference only the book’s content.\n- Highlight and explain important concepts from the book that relate to the goal.\n- Follow a logical, step-by-step process to achieve the goal using the book.\n\n---\n\n**This knowledge ensures students can reliably transform any book into a set of actionable prompts tailored to their unique needs—unlocking the power of books with AI.**",

Upload the PDF of a Book: You provide the full text in an accessible PDF format.  \n  2. Define Your Goal: Clarify the specific outcome you want—such as summarizing the text, extracting action items, or creating a plan based on the book’s main ideas.  \n  3. Generate the Prompt: A tool or process takes your goal and the book’s text to produce a structured or “Super GPT” prompt that is informed by the book’s content.  \n\n• Why This Matters  \n  – Saves Time: Rather than manually sifting through hundreds of pages, you let the system focus on the sections or ideas relevant to your goal.  \n  – Context-Rich Prompts: The system can formulate prompts that directly reference the concepts presented in the book, ensuring answers or outputs are grounded in the original source.  \n  – Tailored Outcomes: Because you specify a clear goal, the resulting prompt is customized to produce exactly what you need, whether it’s an outline, a summary, or a strategy.  \n\n• Basic Structure of a “Super GPT” Prompt  \n  – Role and Goal: Clarify what role the assistant is playing (e.g., “You are a productivity coach…”) and the specific outcome (“Help me create a to-do list…”).  \n  – Input: You specify “the PDF file’s content” or “sections of the text” that are most relevant.  \n  – Context: Give details from the uploaded material that directly help accomplish the goal.  \n  – Rules and Constraints: Point out any conditions, constraints, or style guidelines (for example, “The response must be in bullet points”).  \n  – Step-by-Step Process or Examples: Outline how to tackle the information, or show sample prompts/input-output pairs that help clarify expectations.  \n\nBy learning and applying “Book to Prompt,” students gain a powerful strategy for turning thorough reading material into actionable instructions, tailored precisely to the goal they have in mind. This approach helps them work more efficiently with large texts and produce well-informed, goal-focused results.",

The overall concept:  \n • The module teaches you how to transform any book (provided as a PDF) into actionable prompts that support specific goals.  \n • The idea is to extract information and insights from a book to create a custom prompt that guides a task or process.\n\n2. The role of SuperPrompter GPT:  \n • You’ll be working with a customized agent called “SuperPrompter GPT” whose job is to help you build an effective prompt from your chosen book’s content.  \n • This agent is designed to incorporate context from the file, making the resulting prompt highly relevant to your specific goal.\n\n3. Structuring the prompt:  \n • The process starts with providing the role (SuperPrompter GPT) and the task/goal you want to achieve.  \n • Next, the prompt should be appended with several structured components:\n  - Input specification: Define exactly what type of input (from the PDF or other) is needed.  \n  - Descriptive context: Explain the goal/task, drawing from the content of the book. This includes highlighting key concepts that are crucial to the subject matter.  \n  - Rules for the task: List any constraints, specific rules, or guidelines that must be followed.  \n  - Step-by-step procedure: Provide an ordered set of actions that should be taken to achieve the task.  \n  - Examples: Include any examples from the book that illustrate the task or the process, if available.\n\n4. Important concepts and why they matter:  \n • Defining a clear input helps prevent ambiguity about what content or detail is necessary from the book.  \n • A well-articulated descriptive context ensures that the prompt’s focus aligns with the book’s themes or goals.  \n • Stipulated rules safeguard that the process is consistent and the output meets the necessary criteria.  \n • A detailed, step-by-step procedure helps break down the task into manageable parts that can be systematically followed.  \n • Using examples from the book reinforces understanding and provides a tangible reference for how to apply the procedure.\n\n5. Practical workflow:  \n • Begin by uploading the relevant PDF of the book.  \n • State your desired goal so the prompt can be tailored for that outcome.  \n • The SuperPrompter GPT will then integrate all components (input details, context, rules, procedure, examples) into a cohesive, actionable prompt designed to achieve the set goal.\n\n6. Adherence to guidelines:  \n • It is important to strictly follow the instructions based solely on what is provided in the file, ensuring that the prompt is contextually accurate and relevant.  \n • Be precise and focused on information contained within the book (and provided in the file) to avoid extraneous details.\n\nUnderstanding these fundamentals will enable students to leverage the Book to Prompt method effectively, transforming content from a book into a powerful, tailored prompt that can guide further actions.",

Let’s break down how the **Book to Prompt** technique described above (let’s call it “Book to Prompt Period”) compares to **modern AI prompt engineering techniques** from the current AI boom period (2022–2024), focusing on similarities, differences, and evolutions in method and philosophy.\n\n---\n\n## 1. **Book to Prompt Period Techniques** (as in Lucas C Pimentel’s method)\n\n### Workflow:\n- **Input:** Upload a book (PDF), state your goal.\n- **Role:** AI takes on a specialized persona (“SuperPrompter GPT”).\n- **Prompt Generation:** The AI builds a prompt template for GPTs using:\n  - Clearly defined input\n  - Descriptive context (drawing only from the book)\n  - Highlighted crucial concepts from the book\n  - Rules for the task (constraints, guidelines)\n  - Step-by-step procedures\n  - Examples (if available from the book)\n- **Restrictions:** The system is instructed to only use information from the file, not external knowledge.\n\n### Key Concepts:\n- **Contextual grounding:** All prompts and instructions must be directly derived from the book’s content.\n- **Explicit structure:** Prompts follow a fixed, detailed template.\n- **Transparency:** Each component of the prompt is spelled out for clarity and reproducibility.\n- **No hallucination:** Strictly avoids inventing information outside the provided material.\n\n---\n\n## 2. **Modern AI Prompt Engineering Techniques** (2022–2024)\n\n### Workflow:\n- **Input:** User provides a query or goal, sometimes with supporting documents or data.\n- **Role:** AI may take on specific roles (e.g., expert, tutor), but role definition is often more flexible.\n- **Prompt Generation:** Techniques may include:\n  - **Few-shot prompting:** Providing examples to guide model output.\n  - **Chain-of-thought prompting:** Instructing the model to reason step-by-step.\n  - **Zero-shot prompting:** Relying on the model’s pretrained knowledge without examples.\n  - **System prompts & instructions:** Using a system message to define behavior.\n  - **Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG):** Dynamically pulling in relevant external data or documents to ground responses.\n- **Restrictions:** Increasing use of retrieval tools, but not always limited to a single source.\n\n### Key Concepts:\n- **Hybrid context:** Models often blend external knowledge with user-supplied documents.\n- **Flexible structure:** Prompt formats vary widely; strict templates are less common unless needed for reliability.\n- **Creativity and synthesis:** Models are often encouraged to synthesize or rephrase information, sometimes drawing on general knowledge.\n- **Hallucination mitigation:** Efforts are made to reduce hallucination, e.g., by grounding in data, but not always as strictly as in Book to Prompt.\n\n---\n\n## 3. **Key Differences**\n\n|                  | Book to Prompt Period                            | Modern AI Boom Period                             |\n|------------------|-------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|\n| **Source**       | Only the uploaded book                          | Book + external knowledge (model, internet, RAG)  |\n| **Structure**    | Rigid, template-based                           | Flexible, adaptive, often less structured         |\n| **Creativity**   | Minimal, focused on faithful extraction         | Encouraged (within guardrails)                    |\n| **Hallucination**| Strongly avoided (file-only context)            | Mitigated, but blends external context            |\n| **Explainability**| High—step-by-step breakdown, explicit rules    | Variable; can be chain-of-thought or minimal      |\n| **Example use**  | Only if present in the source                   | User- or AI-generated, or model-internal          |\n| **Goal**         | Build GPT prompts faithful to a source          | Solve user task, sometimes with synthesis         |\n\n---\n\n## 4. **Summary Table**\n\n| Feature               | Book to Prompt               | Modern AI Prompt Engineering   |\n|-----------------------|-----------------------------|-------------------------------|\n| Input                 | Book (PDF) only             | Text, files, web, APIs        |\n| Output                | Prompt for GPT, source-tied | Answer, prompt, synthesis     |\n| Context restriction   | Yes, file-only              | No (can blend sources)        |\n| Template/Structure    | Rigid, multi-part           | Flexible, chain-of-thought    |\n| Role prompt           | Always explicit             | Sometimes explicit            |\n| Example inclusion     | If in source                | Any (user/AI generated)       |\n| Hallucination policy  | Strictly avoided            | Mitigated but not eliminated  |\n\n---\n\n## 5. **Conceptual Evolution**\n\n- **Book to Prompt:** Focuses on **faithful extraction**—transforming book knowledge into actionable, explainable, highly-structured prompts, with no external invention.\n- **Modern AI Prompting:** Emphasizes **creativity, flexibility, and hybrid knowledge**—using both user-provided and general knowledge, with a range of prompt types and less rigid structure, but with growing attention to grounding and hallucination risks.\n\n---\n\n## 6. **In Practice: Example**\n\n**Book to Prompt Style:**\n> \"Using only the information in Chapter 2, generate a prompt that helps a user summarize the main arguments. Define the required input, explain context, list concepts, specify rules, outline steps, and provide examples from Chapter 2.\"\n\n**Modern Prompting:**\n> \"Summarize the main arguments of Chapter 2 of this book. Use any supporting information you need. Show your reasoning step by step.\"\n\n---\n\n## 7. **Conclusion**\n\nThe **Book to Prompt** technique is a highly structured, context-faithful approach that excels at building clear, reproducible prompts from a single authoritative source. **Modern AI prompting** has evolved toward more flexible, hybrid approaches—leveraging both document and model knowledge, supporting creative synthesis, and operating with varying degrees of structure and explainability.\n\n**Key difference:**  \nBook to Prompt is about **faithful extraction and explicit structure** from one source; Modern prompt engineering is about **task completion, creative synthesis, and flexible use of multiple sources**.\n\n---\n\nIf you want a visual or tabular side-by-side based on a specific example, let me know!",

          "response": "Below is an analysis of how the original \"Book to Prompt\" method (as described in the Lucas C Pimentel approach) compares with modern techniques for turning book content into actionable prompts:\n\n1. Approach to Input and Context Processing  \n • Old Method:  \n  – Requires a concrete file upload (like a complete PDF) and then descriptive instructions on the desired goal.  \n  – The process assumes that all needed context is squeezed into a single, large document that is processed in one go.  \n • Modern Methods:  \n  – Often break down the document into semantic chunks using vector embeddings and retrieval-augmented techniques.  \n  – This enables dynamic context retrieval where only the most relevant parts of the text are brought forward for a given query or goal.  \n  – There’s an emphasis on extracting and indexing key concepts rather than processing one whole static input.\n\n2. Prompt Construction Philosophy  \n • Traditional \"Book to Prompt\" Approach:  \n  – Uses a detailed fixed template. For example, it instructs the model to include clearly defined input requirements, contextual descriptions, explicit rules, a step-by-step procedure, and examples—all in one static prompt.  \n  – The structure is pre-ordained (with sections that must be filled out), focusing on ensuring that every piece of the resulting prompt is described explicitly.  \n • Modern Methods:  \n  – Leverage adaptive prompting where context and relevant sections can be updated iteratively based on feedback.  \n  – They may use chain-of-thought prompting to refine answers step by step, allowing a more interactive dialogue for prompt creation.  \n  – The process might involve multiple rounds of refinement, making the prompt more dynamic and tailored to both the book’s nuances and the specific end goal.\n\n3. Handling of Rules and Constraints  \n • Older Technique:  \n  – Embeds a list of explicit rules and steps directly in the final prompt. The model is expected to “abide by the following rules” and to capture specifics like \"constraints on the input\" in its output.  \n  – The prompt design is rule-based and applies a strict template that relies on what’s in the file.  \n • Modern Methods:  \n  – May use more flexible constraints integrated through iterative feedback loops rather than sticking rigidly to a static list.  \n  – Rules can be dynamically adjusted with the help of reinforcement learning or human-in-the-loop corrections, making the process more context-aware and less brittle.\n\n4. Emphasis on Examples and Explaining Concepts  \n • Original Technique:  \n  – It instructs to include examples if the file provides them and to highlight crucial concepts strictly derived from the file content.  \n  – The explanation of important concepts is a one-time static operation driven by the file content alone.  \n • Updated Approaches:  \n  – While still valuing examples and deep conceptual analysis, modern techniques tend to combine these with interactive visualization or dynamic concept mapping.  \n  – They allow for follow-up queries which can refine the explanation of crucial concepts—integrating both supervised insight and unsupervised contextual relationships.\n\n5. Overall Flexibility and Adaptability  \n • \"Book to Prompt\" Technique (AI Boom Period):  \n  – Tends to be a one-shot process: upload the book, state the goal, and receive a detailed, comprehensive prompt.  \n  – It is designed to be a general-purpose transformation from text to prompt using fixed, predetermined structures.  \n • Modern Techniques:  \n  – Often incorporate iterative refinement, where the prompt can be evolved and improved across several steps or interactions.  \n  – Newer systems may automatically tailor the extraction and prompting based on user feedback and evolving context, adapting to both generic and niche tasks more seamlessly.  \n  – Integration with advanced models that have been fine-tuned further enhances nuance capture and context adaptability.\n\nIn summary, while the classic \"Book to Prompt\" method emphasizes a fixed, rule-driven template that extracts and arranges information from a single uploaded document, modern approaches build on this by using dynamic context retrieval, iterative refinements, and flexible answer generation. This transition represents a broader trend in AI—shifting from static one-shot operations toward more interactive, adaptive, and context-aware prompt engineering strategies.",

Descriptive Context\n\n**Context for the Task:**  \nBased on the content of your uploaded book, this prompt is designed to extract and contextualize the main challenges that arise when societies adopt blockchain as a foundational technology. The analysis will focus on the unique properties and structures enabled by blockchain, such as decentralization, transparency, immutability, and trustless systems. It will also consider how these properties intersect with real-world systems—including governance, identity, privacy, and social organization.\n\n**Crucial Concepts:**  \n- **Decentralization:** Shifting control away from centralized authorities, resulting in new questions about consensus, decision-making, and enforcement.\n- **Transparency & Immutability:** While these foster trust, they can create privacy challenges and make it hard to rectify errors or remove harmful content.\n- **Smart Contracts & Automation:** Automating agreements can increase efficiency but also introduce new risks if code or logic is flawed.\n- **Self-Sovereign Identity:** Blockchain allows for user-controlled digital identities, but this raises questions about responsibility, recovery, and interoperability.\n- **Tokenization & Digital Assets:** The creation and management of digital value can disrupt traditional economic systems and create regulatory challenges.\n- **Governance Models:** DAOs and other decentralized governance structures may struggle with scalability, inclusivity, and resistance to manipulation.\n\n---\n\n### 4. Rules to Accomplish the Task\n\n- **Base analysis strictly on the content and concepts presented within the uploaded book.**\n- **Do not speculate or introduce information not found in the source material.**\n- **Adhere to the definitions, frameworks, and terminology as specified by the book.**\n- **Clearly separate direct quotations from your own summarizations or analyses.**\n- **Highlight challenges as presented in the text, and clarify the context for each.**\n\n---\n\n### 5. Step-by-Step Procedure to Accomplish the Task\n\n1. **Ingest and parse the uploaded PDF, extracting main sections and key concepts.**\n2. **Identify all passages, frameworks, or discussions related to challenges in a blockchain-based society.**\n3. **Summarize each challenge, referencing the relevant section or quote from the book.**\n4. **Explain each challenge in the context of the book’s definitions and frameworks.**\n5. **If the book provides solutions or mitigation strategies, summarize those as well.**\n6. **Provide a structured list of challenges, each with a brief explanation and source reference.**\n7. **If requested, relate the challenges to the user’s specified goal or area of interest.**\n\n---\n\n### 6. Examples (If the File Provides Them)\n\n- Example Challenge:  \n  **Privacy versus Transparency**  \n  “As discussed in Chapter 4, while blockchain’s transparency increases accountability, it also exposes user actions to the public, threatening personal privacy. (p. 67)”\n\n- Example Challenge:  \n  **Decentralized Governance Issues**  \n  “The book highlights that DAOs can be susceptible to governance attacks, where a minority can gain outsized influence. See case study, p. 112.”\n\n---\n\n**End of Template**\n\n---\n\nWhen you provide the book PDF and specify your goal, this template can be automatically filled in with content specifically extracted from the file, following your structure and requirements. If you upload the actual book, I can generate a concrete example using its content.",

          "response": "In a society where blockchain technology is fundamental to how information, ownership, and transactions operate, a tool like \"Book to Prompt\"—which transforms uploaded book PDFs into actionable, Super GPT prompts—could face several new challenges. These challenges arise both from technical aspects of blockchain as well as its broader sociolegal and economic implications. Here are some key issues to consider:\n\n1. Copyright and Intellectual Property  \n • Blockchain’s immutability might clash with copyright law when storing or referencing book content.  \n • Tracking and verifying rights ownership in a decentralized ledger could be complex, potentially requiring smart contracts for licensing and revenue sharing whenever a book’s content is processed into a prompt.  \n • The tool may have to integrate with systems that verify whether an uploaded book is cleared for such use, ensuring that neither the publisher’s nor the author’s rights are infringed.\n\n2. Data Privacy and Security  \n • Uploading PDFs to a blockchain-based platform raises concerns around personal data privacy and the handling of sensitive intellectual material.  \n • Although blockchain can enhance security through decentralization, it is also public by nature; mechanisms could be needed to encrypt sensitive parts of the data or store only non-identifiable hashes on-chain.  \n • Ensuring that the uploaded content is not misused and remains accessible only to authorized parties may require advanced access control protocols and possibly off-chain storage solutions.\n\n3. Immutability Versus Prompt Adaptability  \n • One benefit—and challenge—of blockchain is the permanence of recorded data. If a prompt generated from a book contains errors or needs updating, the immutable ledger might record outdated or incorrect version(s) unless innovative revision mechanisms are integrated.  \n • Developing reversible or update-capable smart contract architectures could be necessary so that users can correct or improve prompt generation outcomes without compromising the system’s decentralized integrity.\n\n4. Decentralized Governance and Rule Enforcement  \n • The instructions for turning a book into an actionable prompt rely on clearly defined input, context, rules, steps, and examples. In a blockchain society, enforcing and updating such guidelines might require decentralized voting or consensus mechanisms.  \n • Ensuring that the community standards and rules (for example, regarding quality control or content appropriateness) are consistently maintained becomes more challenging when no central authority is in control.\n\n5. Scalability and Transaction Costs  \n • Blockchain’s current scalability limitations might prove to be a bottleneck when processing potentially large PDFs or when the system must handle high volumes of transactions (e.g., uploading, verifying, and generating prompts).  \n • Users might face transaction fees for interacting with the system (for instance, when a smart contract is triggered), which could deter casual users or require innovative scaling solutions to keep costs low.\n\n6. Identity Verification and Trust  \n • Establishing the provenance of uploaded books and verifying the identities of users who contribute content may be critical in a blockchain environment, where anonymity and pseudonymity are common.  \n • Tools like \"Book to Prompt\" may need to integrate identity verification protocols or reputation systems to build trust among users and ensure that the prompt generation process is not abused by malicious actors.\n\n7. Incentivization and Economic Models  \n • Blockchain-based societies often employ token economies to reward contributors. Implementing a fair rewards system for those who upload high-quality content or contribute significantly to prompt generation could face challenges such as token valuation fluctuations or game-theoretic abuses.  \n • Ensuring that the economic incentives align with the quality and integrity of the output requires robust smart contract design and continuous monitoring.\n\nIn summary, while \"Book to Prompt\" presents an innovative way to turn static literature into actionable digital instructions, implementing it in a blockchain-based society adds layers of complexity. Addressing issues around copyright, data security, immutability, decentralized governance, scalability, identity verification, and incentivization will be key to its successful adoption and operation in such an environment.",

          "response": "Absolutely! Here’s a theoretical and logical framework for understanding how the **Book to Prompt** approach (as described in your markdown and by the tool) works:\n\n---\n\n## Theoretical Framework: Book to Prompt\n\n### 1. **Input Acquisition & Clarification**\n- **User uploads a book (PDF)**\n  - The system parses and analyzes the contents of the book.\n- **User specifies a goal/task/role**\n  - This goal is what the actionable prompt will help accomplish (e.g., “Summarize each chapter for a study guide” or “Extract negotiation strategies”).\n\n### 2. **Contextualization & Understanding**\n- **Text Extraction**\n  - The system reads the book to understand relevant sections, concepts, frameworks, and examples.\n- **Goal Alignment**\n  - The system aligns its processing with the user’s goal, ensuring all following steps are relevant to the intended outcome.\n\n### 3. **Prompt Construction Framework**\nFollowing your markdown guidelines, the system constructs an actionable prompt with these elements:\n\n#### a. **Clearly Defined Input**\n- Specifies exactly what the AI expects as input (e.g., “Provide a chapter number and receive a summary”).\n- Ensures the prompt user knows how to interact.\n\n#### b. **Descriptive Context**\n- Draws from the book to describe:\n    - The core idea of the task or goal.\n    - Key concepts, definitions, and frameworks from the book that are relevant.\n    - Any nuances or special considerations (e.g., “This book emphasizes ethical negotiation; keep recommendations ethical”).\n\n#### c. **Rules to Accomplish the Task**\n- Lists constraints, boundaries, or requirements found in the book or implied by the goal.\n    - E.g., “Summaries must not exceed 150 words.”\n    - “Always cite the original page number.”\n\n#### d. **Step-by-step Procedure**\n- Outlines the recommended steps (based on the book’s approach or logic) for accomplishing the goal.\n    - E.g., “First identify the main thesis of the chapter; next list supporting arguments; finally, summarize examples.”\n\n#### e. **Examples**\n- Pulls relevant examples from the book (if available) to demonstrate how to use the prompt or what a proper output looks like.\n\n---\n\n## Logical Flow\n\n1. **User Input**: Book PDF + Goal/Task.\n2. **System Processing**:\n    - Parse book for sections and concepts related to the goal.\n    - Extract relevant content and examples.\n    - Structure this knowledge into the prompt framework.\n3. **Prompt Output**: Actionable, context-rich prompt tailored to the user’s goal and the book’s content.\n\n---\n\n## Key Principles\n\n- **Book-derived context**: Only use information, rules, and procedures found in the book.\n- **Goal-oriented**: The prompt is always shaped by the user’s stated goal.\n- **Explicitness**: All input requirements, rules, and steps are clearly stated.\n- **Actionability**: The final prompt enables a clear, executable task.\n\n---\n\n## Example (Hypothetical)\n\n**Book:** *Getting to Yes*\n**Goal:** Extract negotiation tactics as actionable advice.\n\n**Prompt Output Structure:**\n\n- **Input:** Specify a negotiation scenario.\n- **Context:** Based on *Getting to Yes*, which emphasizes principled negotiation, this prompt will extract tactics relevant to your scenario.\n- **Key Concepts:** Separate people from the problem; focus on interests, not positions; invent options for mutual gain, etc.\n- **Rules:** Advice must be non-adversarial and seek win-win outcomes.\n- **Step-by-step:**\n    1. Analyze scenario for underlying interests.\n    2. Identify possible options for mutual gain.\n    3. Suggest principled negotiation tactics.\n- **Example:** [Example from book]\n\n---\n\n## Conclusion\n\n**Book to Prompt** is a logical, modular approach to transforming book content into actionable AI prompts. It grounds the prompt in the book’s own concepts, aligns with the user’s goal, and structures the instructions for clarity, relevance, and practical use—following a repeatable template.\n\n---\n\nLet me know if you’d like a deeper breakdown of any specific step!",

          "response": "Below is a high-level, theoretical framework for turning a book (in PDF form) into an actionable prompt. Since no specific file content is provided, the following explanation remains generic. It focuses on the logical process itself rather than any particular text. This framework aligns with the approach described as “Book to Prompt.”\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n1. ROLE DEFINITION\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n• Role of the system (e.g., “SuperPrompter GPT”): To convert the content of a book into a well-structured prompt that achieves a specific goal.\n\nWhy this matters:\n• Having a clear role helps focus the system on the transformation task (rather than summarizing or conducting only a Q&A).\n• Defines the “point of view” for the system, ensuring consistent instructions.\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n2. TASK/GOAL IDENTIFICATION\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n• Requester’s Goal: The user defines what they want to achieve using the book’s content. For example:\n  – “Generate a plan to practice leadership skills by using insights from this book.”\n  – “Create a creative writing prompt based on the narrative style of the text.”\n• The book is the knowledge source; the user’s goal shapes how the system will process that knowledge.\n\nWhy this matters:\n• It sets the orientation for which parts of the book’s content will be relevant.\n• It prevents aimless or overly general outputs by providing a final objective.\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n3. INPUT SPECIFICATION\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n• Clearly define the type of input:\n  – A digital copy of the book (e.g., PDF).\n  – The user’s goal or objective.\n• Potential advanced input formats:\n  – Key chapters or sections of the book if only part of the text is relevant.\n  – Metadata such as the author’s background, publication date, or summary notes.\n\nWhy this matters:\n• Being explicit about the input helps shape how the system is supposed to consume the information (whether entire PDF or specific chapters).\n• Ensures that the system knows which portions of text to focus on.\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n4. DESCRIPTIVE CONTEXT\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n• Description of the task in relation to the book’s main ideas:\n  – Summaries of relevant themes, characters, or arguments.\n  – Concepts that must be highlighted to serve the user’s goal.\n• Explanation of the user’s objective in the context of the book:\n  – “If your goal is to improve leadership skills, the relevant sections might be the chapters on team management and communication.”\n\nWhy this matters:\n• Adding context ensures the final prompt capitalizes on the core concepts the user needs.\n• It reduces irrelevant or extraneous information.\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n5. RULES AND CONSTRAINTS\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n• Constraints on the input:\n  – Must be in English or a certain language.\n  – The book must be in a readable format (no scanned images that can’t be processed).\n• Procedural guidelines:\n  – The system should not deviate from the text’s perspective.\n  – The system may paraphrase, but remain faithful to the book’s ideas.\n\nWhy this matters:\n• Clarifies how much creative interpretation is allowed.\n• Ensures that the final output remains relevant, accurate, and properly attributed to the source material.\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n6. STEP-BY-STEP PROCEDURE\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nBelow is a general workflow for turning the uploaded book into a specialized prompt:\n\n1) Ingest the PDF Text:\n   – Convert the PDF into processable text.\n   – Segment the text into logically sized chunks (e.g., by chapter or thematic sections).\n\n2) Identify Key Sections:\n   – Scan the text to find segments most relevant to the user’s goal.\n   – Flag notable quotes, principles, or data relevant to the stated objective.\n\n3) Extract Core Concepts:\n   – Summarize or list the key ideas from the segments.\n   – Identify any frameworks, formulae, or step-by-step methods mentioned in the book.\n\n4) Map Concepts to Goal:\n   – For each key concept, clarify how it can support the user’s goal.\n   – Determine whether it offers insight, actionable steps, or inspiration.\n\n5) Draft Prompt Components:\n   – Craft instructions based on the user’s stated goal (e.g., “Using the leadership principles from Chapter 3, propose a 30-day plan…”).\n   – Include relevant details or context so the prompt is self-contained.\n\n6) Structure the Prompt:\n   – Incorporate the user’s role, goal, context, and instructions into a cohesive text prompt.\n   – List steps or strategies that are recommended by or derived from the source content.\n\n7) Provide Examples or Illustrations (If Available):\n   – Use examples from the book or the user’s domain to clarify how the prompt should be used.\n   – Show how previous real or hypothetical cases might apply.\n\n8) Final Check:\n   – Ensure that the final prompt maintains fidelity to the original book concepts.\n   – Review for clarity and coherence.\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n7. EXAMPLES (HYPOTHETICAL)\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nBelow are simplified, illustrative examples (since no actual book content is provided):\n\nExample A: Personal Development Focus\n-------------------------------------\nGoal:\n• “Help me apply this book’s habits framework to increase my productivity.”\n\nSuperPrompter GPT Prompt Output:\n• Role: “You want to adopt the book’s 5-step daily routine strategy.”\n• Input: “Highlights from Chapter 2: The 5-Step Morning Routine & Chapter 4: Tracking Progress.”\n• Descriptive Context: “The book emphasizes starting the day with core behaviors that set productive momentum.”\n• Rules:\n  1. Only use the 5-step morning routine from Chapter 2.\n  2. Ensure action items are personalized and realistic in scope.\n• Procedure:\n  1. Identify the 5-step routine.\n  2. Explain its relevance to daily productivity.\n  3. Propose a 7-day trial plan.\n• Example Output Step: \n  “Step 1: Wake up at a consistent time. Step 2: Practice mindful journaling…”\n  \nExample B: Business Strategy Focus\n----------------------------------\nGoal:\n• “Give me a structured prompt for creating a market entry plan using the principles from the book’s marketing chapters.”\n\nSuperPrompter GPT Prompt Output:\n• Role: “Business strategist applying the book’s 3-phase market analysis approach.”\n• Input: “Chapters 5–7 focusing on consumer research, competitor analysis, and brand positioning.”\n• Descriptive Context: “These chapters form a complete method for assessing market needs…”\n• Rules:\n  1. Rely on the data-collection methods exactly as described in Chapter 5.\n  2. Where relevant, use the competitor analysis from Chapter 6.\n• Procedure:\n  1. Identify target market and pain points.\n  2. Conduct competitor analysis (summarizing strengths, weaknesses).\n  3. Draft brand messaging that differentiates the offering.\n• Example Output Step:\n  “Phase 1: Research — gather demographic data and highlight key consumer pain points…”\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n8. CONCLUSION\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nThis theoretical framework shows how you can systematically convert a book into an actionable, goal-aligned prompt. The essential steps include defining the user’s role and objective, clarifying input constraints, extracting relevant concepts from the source, structuring a prompt that aligns with the user’s goal, and finally validating the prompt’s completeness and consistency with the original text. \n\nFollowing these steps helps ensure that:\n• The core ideas from the source are accurately represented.  \n• The created prompt is actionable and addresses the user’s objective.  \n• The final result is coherent, structured, and effectively uses book-derived insights to guide the user toward their goal.",

          "response": "At its core, the “Book to Prompt” concept represents a methodical approach to transforming a large, structured source of information (a book) into a concise, task-oriented prompt. The logical framework underlying this process can be broken down into several interrelated components:\n\n1. Input Acquisition and Parsing  \n  • The process begins by uploading the PDF of a book, which acts as the raw material.  \n  • The uploaded content is parsed and segmented, turning a broad text resource into manageable pieces of context. This step is analogous to the “extraction” phase in data processing, where relevant passages or themes are identified.\n\n2. Goal or Task Definition  \n  • Alongside the book upload, the user provides a specific goal or task they wish to address.  \n  • This goal acts as a filter, narrowing the focus to particular themes, ideas, or procedures present in the book. It is the “transformation” element—reframing the book's contents into a concrete, actionable outcome.\n\n3. Structured Prompt Composition  \n  The prompt is constructed in a modular and layered way, ensuring clarity and guidance for the language model. Its components include:\n    a. Clearly Defined Input  \n      – Specify exactly what type of data or information is needed from the model.  \n    b. Descriptive Context  \n      – Provide a summary of the relevant parts of the book, ensuring that the model understands the key concepts, themes, or theories derived from the text.  \n    c. Rules to Accomplish the Task  \n      – List constraints, guidelines, or any specific rules that the output must adhere to, ensuring that the response would be aligned with the original book’s intentions.  \n    d. Step-by-Step Procedure  \n      – Clearly delineate a logical procedure or set of steps that guide the solution, making the transformation process transparent.  \n    e. Examples  \n      – Where applicable, provide examples from the book to illustrate the expected format or depth of the response, which can help the model generate output that is both relevant and grounded in the source material.\n\n4. Contextual Relevance and Emphasis on Essential Concepts  \n  • To add depth and ensure the transformation is precise, the framework mandates a focus on crucial ideas from the original text.  \n  • By highlighting and elaborating on these core concepts, the prompt not only instructs the model on what to do but also enriches its understanding of the background and relevance of the task.\n\n5. Iterative Refinement and Modular Adaptation  \n  • The process is inherently iterative. If the initial prompt does not meet expectations, the structure supports refinement—adjusting input definitions, context or procedure—until the desired actionable prompt is formed.  \n  • This modular approach ensures that components can be easily added, modified, or removed depending on the specific requirements of the goal.\n\nIn practical terms, imagine this framework as a layered sandwich:  \n  – The base (the book) offers an extensive range of themes and ideas.  \n  – The goal provided by the user determines which “slice” of the book is to be focused on.  \n  – The prompt construction layers (input, context, rules, procedure, examples) then build upon that slice, ensuring that the final actionable prompt is both concise and rooted in the source material.\n\nThus, the logical framework for “Book to Prompt” is essentially a systematic conversion pipeline: it starts with comprehensive input extraction, passes through a transformation stage guided by the user-defined goal, and finally outputs a structured, context-rich prompt that encapsulates the original intentions of the book within a clearly defined task direction.",

          "response": "Analyzing this case study involves carefully dissecting each component of the instructions and the overall objective. Here’s a step-by-step way to approach it:\n\n1. Understand the overarching goal:  \n   • The instructions say you want to create a “Super GPT prompt” based on the context of a file—the file presumably contains a methodology or content about generating prompts from books.  \n   • Your role (“You are SuperPrompter GPT”) clarifies that you will be synthesizing data from the file to produce a detailed and structured prompt.  \n\n2. Identify the required sections for the final prompt:  \n   • The instructions specifically mention appending the final prompt with:  \n     – A clearly defined input section  \n     – A descriptive context section  \n     – A rules section  \n     – A step-by-step procedure  \n     – Examples (if they exist in the file)  \n\n3. Determine what “clearly defined input” means:  \n   • This is where you specify what type of user data or content is expected.  \n   • Think about the format—whether it’s a user question, a user’s goal, or specific pieces of text—and how it ties back to the objective of summarizing or transforming the content of a book.  \n\n4. Gather the most important highlights and concepts from the file:  \n   • The prompt indicates you should only talk about content actually in the file.  \n   • Prioritize major themes, definitions, or ideas that will clarify the user’s goal.  \n   • For instance, if the file covers strategies to “turn any book into an actionable prompt,” focus on those strategies and how they apply to the user’s goal.  \n\n5. Pin down the rules to follow:  \n   • Identify any constraints (e.g., “keep the summary under 300 words,” “use bullet points,” “avoid spoilers,” etc.) that the file or the instructions explicitly mention.  \n   • Clarify any disclaimers or guidelines the file might provide for transforming text into prompts.  \n\n6. Lay out the step-by-step procedure:  \n   • This procedure should flow logically—each step needs to build on the previous one.  \n   • For example, it might start with reading a section of the book, identifying keywords, then turning those keywords into a prompt outline, and so on.  \n   • Use any process or methodology mentioned in the file to form this sequence.  \n\n7. Incorporate examples if they are in the file:  \n   • If the file provides actual examples of how it transforms text into a prompt, use a representative one to clarify how the user should format their query or how the system will respond.  \n\n8. Maintain clarity and consistency:  \n   • Ensure that the sections (input, context, rules, procedure, examples) tie together cohesively.  \n   • Maintain the same terminology throughout and avoid adding content not found in the file.  \n\nBy following these steps—extracting the file’s critical elements, structuring them into the sections specified, and focusing on helping the end-user see how to turn the book’s content into a dynamically generated prompt—you’ll successfully analyze the instructions and create the “Super GPT prompt” accurately and effectively.",

Here’s a suggested approach:\n\n1. Identify the Role and Task:\n • Note that the prompt begins by assigning a role (“You are SuperPrompter GPT”) and clearly sets the goal: to help create a Super GPT prompt using the contents of a file (in this case, a PDF of a book).  \n • Recognize that the process starts once you provide the role and task/goal.\n\n2. Examine the Structure of the Output:\n • Clearly Defined Input: The prompt instructs that you specify the exact type of input needed. This means detailing what elements (data, context, etc.) the final prompt should accept.\n • Descriptive Context: Look for the instruction to “offer a relevant description of the goal/task derived from the file.” This necessitates an explanation or summary of the book’s content that is pertinent to the goal.\n • Highlighting Crucial Concepts: Note that it asks you to elaborate on important concepts related to the task, ensuring that the final prompt is informed by key themes within the file.\n • Rules to Accomplish the Task: The prompt insists on enumerating any specific constraints or procedural guidelines.\n • Step-by-Step Procedure: It requires laying out a logical, sequential process for how to achieve the task.\n • Examples: If the file contains examples, they should be included to further illustrate the process or desired outcomes.\n\n3. Understand the Emphasis on File-Based Context:\n • The instructions make it clear that all details and context must be derived solely from what is available in the file.\n • This ensures that the final output stays true to the content and concepts provided in the book.\n\n4. Reflect on the Purpose:\n • Recognize that the purpose of this prompt is to transform static content (the book in PDF form) into actionable, dynamic instructions tailored to a specific goal.\n • The idea is to build a bridge between the passive reading experience and active implementation by converting content into a task-driven format.\n\n5. Final Analysis Strategy:\n • Map out an outline for your analysis that follows the provided structure. This means starting with identifying the role and task, then detailing the input needed, contextual information, rules, procedures, and examples.\n • Ensure that you strictly adhere to the file’s content and avoid bringing in external concepts.\n • Emphasize clarity and precision, as the prompt stresses a “clearly defined” structure and explicit rules.\n\nBy taking this systematic approach to dissect the prompt, you can understand how each part contributes to creating an effective Super GPT prompt that leverages the book’s content for actionable insights. This breakdown should provide the clarity needed to further develop or refine your analysis based solely on the information provided in the file.",

Below, I’ll outline the most relevant theoretical frameworks and explain how they relate to your project. This will help you justify your research rigorously.\n\n---\n\n## 1. **Prompt Engineering and Large Language Models (LLMs)**\n\n**Why?**\n- Your project is about transforming book content (unstructured text) into structured prompts for LLMs like GPT-4.\n- Prompt engineering is an emerging field with substantial research on how prompt structures affect model outputs.\n\n**Key Concepts:**\n- **Prompt Design:** How the formulation of prompts influences the quality and relevance of generated outputs.\n- **Few-shot and Zero-shot Learning:** LLMs can perform tasks with little to no training examples if prompted correctly.\n- **Contextualization:** The importance of providing context (book summary, goals, etc.) for accurate completions.\n\n**Relevant Works:**\n- Brown et al., 2020 (GPT-3 paper)\n- Reynolds & McDonell, 2021 (Prompt Programming for LLMs)\n- Liu et al., 2023 (A Survey of Prompt Engineering)\n\n---\n\n## 2. **Information Extraction and Text Summarization**\n\n**Why?**\n- Your system needs to ingest book PDFs, extract relevant content, and summarize or repackage it as prompts.\n\n**Key Concepts:**\n- **Natural Language Understanding (NLU):** Methods for machines to understand and process unstructured text.\n- **Semantic Segmentation:** Breaking down books into sections/chapters relevant for prompt creation.\n- **Content Summarization:** Techniques to create concise, goal-oriented summaries.\n\n**Relevant Works:**\n- Mihalcea & Radev, 2011 (Graph-based NLP and IR)\n- Nallapati et al., 2016 (Abstractive Summarization with Sequence-to-Sequence RNNs)\n\n---\n\n## 3. **Instructional Design and Goal-Oriented Learning**\n\n**Why?**\n- Users supply a goal, and the system creates prompts to achieve that goal using book content. This aligns with instructional design: mapping content to learning objectives.\n\n**Key Concepts:**\n- **Backward Design:** Starting with the goal (desired result), then designing the process to achieve it.\n- **Task Analysis:** Decomposing goals into actionable steps/prompts.\n- **Personalization:** Tailoring prompts to user-defined goals.\n\n**Relevant Works:**\n- Wiggins & McTighe, 2005 (Understanding by Design)\n- Merrill, 2002 (First Principles of Instruction)\n\n---\n\n## 4. **Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) and Usability**\n\n**Why?**\n- The workflow—uploading PDFs, specifying goals, receiving prompts—involves user interaction, system feedback, and iterative refinement.\n\n**Key Concepts:**\n- **User-Centered Design:** Designing systems that focus on user needs and context.\n- **Affordances in UI:** Making workflows intuitive for non-technical users.\n\n**Relevant Works:**\n- Norman, 2013 (The Design of Everyday Things)\n- Nielsen, 1994 (Usability Engineering)\n\n---\n\n## 5. **Automation and Procedural Knowledge**\n\n**Why?**\n- Your approach is about automating the transformation of static content into dynamic, actionable instructions (prompts).\n\n**Key Concepts:**\n- **Proceduralization:** Turning declarative knowledge (book content) into procedural knowledge (step-by-step prompts).\n- **Rule-based Systems:** Encoding rules for transforming and validating inputs/outputs.\n\n---\n\n## **How to Integrate These Theories**\n\n### Theoretical Foundation Section (Example Skeleton):\n\n1. **Prompt Engineering and LLMs** provide the technical underpinning for transforming textual input into effective prompts.\n2. **Information Extraction and Summarization** ground the methods for parsing and condensing book content.\n3. **Instructional Design** informs the mapping of book content to user goals, ensuring prompts are actionable and relevant.\n4. **HCI Principles** ensure the system is usable and accessible.\n5. **Automation and Proceduralization** frame the rules and step-by-step procedures that your system implements.\n\n---\n\n### **Sample Theoretical Foundation Statement:**\n\n> This research is grounded in the emerging field of prompt engineering (Brown et al., 2020; Liu et al., 2023), which examines how structured inputs can optimize language model outputs. The system leverages information extraction and summarization techniques (Mihalcea & Radev, 2011) to translate book content into concise, goal-oriented prompts. Drawing from instructional design theory (Wiggins & McTighe, 2005), the workflow emphasizes backward design—starting from user goals to generate actionable prompts. User experience design principles (Norman, 2013) ensure the accessibility and usability of the workflow. Finally, the automation of this process is informed by procedural knowledge frameworks, enabling systematic transformation of declarative content into procedural instructions.\n\n---\n\n### **References:**\n- Brown, T.

However, based on the general idea of transforming books into actionable prompts, here are some commonly used theoretical foundations that people often draw upon for similar “text-to-prompt” or “content transformation” projects. You might consider one or a combination of these (if they align with the material presented in your source):\n\n1. Constructivist Learning Theory\n   • Emphasizes how learners construct new knowledge based on prior understanding and active engagement.  \n   • Relevant to “Book to Prompt” because prompts can be designed to help learners actively make sense of the text rather than passively read.\n\n2. Cognitive Load Theory\n   • Focuses on how information processing is affected by the inherent load placed on working memory.  \n   • Turning a lengthy book into segmented, targeted prompts can help manage cognitive load by chunking information into manageable pieces.\n\n3. Bloom’s Taxonomy (Revised)\n   • Provides a hierarchy of cognitive processes: Remember, Understand, Apply, Analyze, Evaluate, and Create.  \n   • Useful for structuring prompts to target different cognitive levels, ensuring that the prompts go beyond simple recall and help scaffold deeper understanding.\n\n4. Connectivism\n   • Suggests that knowledge is created and shared across networks—in this case, a digital network of tools, resources, and people.  \n   • The “Book to Prompt” approach can embed the text in a larger network of AI tools and collaborative frameworks, guiding learners or users to form new connections and insights.\n\n5. Transformative Learning Theory\n   • Focuses on facilitating profound shifts in learners’ frames of reference.  \n   • By prompting reflection and critical analysis of the book’s content, “Book to Prompt” can promote the transformative aspect of reading.\n\n6. Conversation/Dialogue Learning Theory\n   • Highlights the importance of dialogue in knowledge creation.  \n   • Prompts often spark a back-and-forth exchange—between the user and AI or among peers—turning a static text into a more interactive, dialogical learning experience.\n\n7. Instructional Systems Design (e.g., ADDIE, Gagné’s Events of Instruction)\n   • Offers processes for analyzing, designing, developing, implementing, and evaluating instruction.  \n   • “Book to Prompt” can incorporate these systematic approaches to ensure prompts are effectively guiding users toward the desired learning objectives.\n\nChoosing which theory—or combination—best underpins your dissertation proposal will depend on your research questions and the learning or user outcomes you seek. If your file explicitly references any of these theories (or others not listed), you should prioritize the ones directly mentioned or implied in the text for deeper alignment with your source material.",

          "response": "For a dissertation exploring the conversion of book content into actionable prompts, you can ground your work in several interrelated theoretical frameworks. Here are some suggestions tailored to your proposal:\n\n1. Prompt Engineering & Instructional Design Theory  \n • This framework views prompts as carefully designed instructions that transform raw content into actionable tasks. Drawing on principles from Instructional Systems Design (like the ADDIE model), your work can focus on how a book’s structured information is decomposed into defined inputs, contexts, rules, and step-by-step procedures. This mirrors the approach of breaking down complex content into manageable, goal-oriented elements.\n\n2. Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Computational Linguistics  \n • Since you’re converting text (from books) into prompts, grounding your work in the theories of text extraction, summarization, and semantic understanding is natural. Concepts from these fields (such as pattern recognition, semantic parsing, and text summarization) support the idea of systematically mapping long-form content into targeted instructions.\n\n3. Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) & User-Centered Design  \n • Given that the end goal is to interact with a language model (SuperPrompter GPT) effectively, theories from HCI and user-centered design are relevant. They emphasize the importance of clear, concise input, logically ordered steps, and feedback loops to ensure that the generated prompt truly aligns with the user’s goals.\n\n4. Cognitive Science and Situated Cognition  \n • Translating a book’s content into actionable prompts involves understanding how users process and apply information. Cognitive theories—such as Cognitive Load Theory and Situated Cognition—can inform how to structure prompts so that they align with human comprehension and context-dependent reasoning. This ensures that instructions are not only precise but also usable in real-world problem solving.\n\nEach of these frameworks highlights different aspects of your project:\n – The Instructional Design approach deals with systematic breakdown (input, context, rules, steps, examples).\n – The NLP perspective ensures that the foundational processes (extraction and summarization) are grounded in robust computational methods.\n – The HCI viewpoint guarantees that the final prompts are designed with the end user’s needs in mind.\n – The Cognitive Science background reminds us that human understanding of instructions is inherently linked to context and clarity.\n\nBy integrating these theoretical foundations, your dissertation will have a robust, multidisciplinary framework supporting the process of turning a book’s content into actionable, goal-oriented prompts.",

          "response": "Given your dissertation proposal focusing on creating actionable prompts from books (\"Book to Prompt\"), you should ideally ground your theoretical foundation in established theories and models related to educational technology, instructional design, cognitive psychology, and prompt engineering principles. Here are several strong theoretical foundations you can consider:\n\n1. **Cognitive Load Theory (CLT)**  \n   *(Sweller, 1988; Sweller, van Merriënboer, & Paas, 1998)*  \n   CLT focuses on how information presentation affects learners' cognitive processes. It emphasizes optimizing instructional methods to reduce extraneous cognitive load and maximize learning efficiency.  \n   **Application:**  \n   Your prompt design should reduce cognitive load, making complex texts actionable and easily digestible.\n\n2. **Constructivist Learning Theory**  \n   *(Piaget, Vygotsky, Bruner)*  \n   Constructivism argues that learners actively construct their knowledge through experience, reflection, and interaction. Prompt creation from books resonates with constructivist principles, enabling learners to actively engage with textual materials to construct meaningful knowledge.  \n   **Application:**  \n   Your prompts should encourage active reflection, building new knowledge through interactive engagement and structured inquiry.\n\n3. **Bloom's Taxonomy of Learning Objectives**  \n   *(Bloom et al., 1956 revised by Anderson & Krathwohl, 2001)*  \n   Bloom’s taxonomy categorizes cognitive skills into hierarchical levels: Remembering, Understanding, Applying, Analyzing, Evaluating, and Creating.  \n   **Application:**  \n   Your prompts can explicitly target higher-order thinking skills, guiding learners from basic comprehension toward deeper analysis and creative application.\n\n4. **Situated Learning Theory and Communities of Practice**  \n   *(Lave & Wenger, 1991)*  \n   Situated learning emphasizes learning as a social and contextual phenomenon. Learning occurs through authentic practices embedded in real contexts and through interaction within communities of practice.  \n   **Application:**  \n   Your prompts can be contextually situated, enabling learners to relate abstract book content directly to real-world tasks and communities.\n\n5. **Theory of Multimedia Learning and Multimedia Principles**  \n   *(Mayer, 2001, 2009)*  \n   Mayer’s theory provides principles to design instructional materials integrating words, images, and multimedia effectively. It underlines principles like coherence, signaling, segmenting, and personalization to enhance learner comprehension.  \n   **Application:**  \n   These principles can inform how you structure prompts, enhancing clarity and facilitating deeper understanding through careful sequencing and clear communication.\n\n6. **Prompt Engineering Frameworks**  \n   Prompt engineering is a practical field but is theoretically informed by Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) and Natural Language Processing (NLP). Theories of usability (Nielsen, 1994) and interaction design (Norman, 1988) are particularly relevant.  \n   **Application:**  \n   These theoretical frameworks can guide the technical aspects of your prompt creation, ensuring usability, clarity, and effective interaction between users and AI-generated content.\n\nRecommended Integrated Approach:\n\nConsider combining these theories into a coherent framework for your dissertation:\n\n- **Primary cognitive framework:** Cognitive Load Theory and Constructivist Learning Theory (to ensure effective learning and cognitive efficiency).\n- **Instructional and pedagogical framework:** Bloom’s Taxonomy (to structure prompts around specific educational objectives).\n- **Contextual and situational engagement:** Situated Learning Theory (to ensure prompts remain authentic, contextual, and actionable).\n- **Multimedia and interaction design principles:** Mayer’s Multimedia Theory and Prompt Engineering Frameworks (for designing clear, usable, and interaction-oriented prompts).\n\nBy integrating these theoretical foundations, your dissertation will achieve robust justification, clarity, and depth.",

Prompt Engineering and Instructional Design  \n • Role Definition: How should the tool articulate roles (e.g., “SuperPrompter GPT”) to guide the AI?  \n • Structured Instruction Components:  \n  – Clearly defined input: What format should the user’s content or instructions be in?  \n  – Descriptive context: How do we derive and embed context from the book into the prompt?  \n  – Task rules and constraints: What limits or rules need to be enforced?  \n  – Step-by-step procedures: How should the process be broken down into clear, sequential actions?  \n  – Examples: Which examples (if any) from the book can be used to showcase the intended approach?\n\n3. Content Extraction and Data Handling  \n • PDF Analysis: How will the file’s content be parsed, summarized, or referenced?  \n • Relevance filtering: What techniques are used to extract only the most relevant parts of the book?  \n • Data integrity: How will you ensure that only content present in the file informs the prompt’s context?\n\n4. Technical and User Experience (UX) Implementation  \n • Input/Output clarity: How will the tool ask for user input and display the generated prompt?  \n • Iterative feedback: Is there a mechanism for users to refine the prompt if the first output isn’t perfect?  \n • Scalability: How can the tool accommodate books of various sizes and complexity without overwhelming the user?\n\n5. Domain Expertise and Content Relevance  \n • Subject matter: Are there experts familiar with the type of content the book covers, so that the prompt’s context is both accurate and useful?  \n • Critical Concepts: Which concepts from the book must be emphasized, and why are they important for the task at hand?\n\n6. Quality Control and Testing  \n • Validation: How will you test that the generated prompts correctly reflect the book’s content without adding extraneous details?  \n • Consistency: What processes will ensure that similar books or objectives yield consistently high-quality prompts?\n\nEngaging experts from these areas will help you create a comprehensive, user-friendly system that transforms book content into a highly actionable Super GPT prompt. Each perspective contributes to ensuring that the prompt is clear, context-rich, easy to follow, and technically sound—all derived strictly from the content of the file.",

Let’s analyze, from a theoretical perspective, the assumptions underlying the process described in ## Book to Prompt by Lucas C Pimentel, as outlined in the provided markdown.\n\n### 1. Theoretical Assumptions\n\n#### a. The Assumption of Semantic Extractability\n- **What it is:** The method assumes that the content and key ideas of any book (uploaded as a PDF) can be systematically extracted and translated into actionable, context-rich prompts.\n- **Underlying theory:** Language models are capable of parsing, summarizing, and reorganizing large, complex texts into structured outputs targeted at specific goals.\n\n#### b. The Assumption of Goal-Driven Abstraction\n- **What it is:** The user’s goal, when paired with the book’s content, can be operationalized into a prompt that meaningfully bridges the two.\n- **Underlying theory:** Abstract goals can be mapped to actionable instructions if the context is sufficiently well-defined.\n\n#### c. The Assumption of Prompt Engineering Universality\n- **What it is:** There exists a generalizable template or set of steps (input, context, rules, procedure, examples) that can be applied to any book and any user goal to produce a high-quality prompt.\n- **Underlying theory:** The process of prompt engineering can be systematized, regardless of domain, if the information is structured appropriately.\n\n#### d. The Assumption of Contextual Sufficiency\n- **What it is:** The “descriptive context” extracted from the book and elaborated concepts will be sufficient to inform both the prompt and the model’s subsequent outputs.\n- **Underlying theory:** Providing relevant context and highlighting key concepts will adequately ground the model’s reasoning for task completion.\n\n#### e. The Assumption of Procedural Decomposition\n- **What it is:** Any task derived from a book can be broken down into clear, logical steps that can be explicitly listed and followed.\n- **Underlying theory:** Complex intellectual tasks can be decomposed into ordered procedures suitable for AI or human execution.\n\n#### f. The Assumption of Rule Specification\n- **What it is:** All necessary constraints, requirements, and guidelines can be explicitly articulated as “rules” for the task.\n- **Underlying theory:** Making implicit task constraints explicit will improve the prompt’s clarity and the quality of the resulting outputs.\n\n#### g. The Assumption of Example Transferability\n- **What it is:** Examples from the book (if available) will help illustrate and clarify the prompt, increasing its effectiveness.\n- **Underlying theory:** Concrete examples facilitate understanding and generalization to new but related tasks.\n\n#### h. The Assumption of File-Content Fidelity\n- **What it is:** All context, rules, and concepts used in the prompt must be grounded solely in the uploaded file—no outside knowledge or assumptions are to be introduced.\n- **Underlying theory:** Fidelity to the source material ensures relevance and accuracy, and prevents hallucination or overgeneralization.\n\n---\n\n### 2. Summary\nIn summary, the process in ## Book to Prompt rests on the theoretical assumption that:\n- **Textual content can be algorithmically abstracted into structured, goal-driven prompts.**\n- **This abstraction process is generalizable, modular, and can be consistently applied across diverse domains, tasks, and goals, provided sufficient context and constraints are extracted from the source material.**\n- **Strict adherence to source material ensures accuracy and contextual fit.**\n\n---\n\n**References to the Process:**\n- The step-by-step breakdown (input, context, rules, procedure, examples) presumes tasks are decomposable and context is extractable.\n- The rules about only using file content and being descriptive but precise imply a grounding in source fidelity and avoidance of model hallucination.\n\n---\n\nIf you want a more formal or philosophical framing (e.g., in terms of information theory, epistemology, or AI alignment), let me know!",

Some of the key assumptions include:\n\n1) The text is comprehensible and relevant to the user’s goal.  \n   • It is assumed that the uploaded PDF is both linguistically understandable by the language model (e.g., written in a language it can parse) and thematically relevant for the user’s particular objective.  \n   • This implies the method relies on the text having enough explanatory or conceptual content to be transformed into something useful for the user’s task.\n\n2) The user’s goal can be defined clearly enough to guide prompt creation.  \n   • The framework presupposes that the user can articulate a sufficiently precise goal or objective (“Tell your goal”).  \n   • Clarity in the user’s goal enables the AI to extract, filter, or summarize only the most pertinent segments of the uploaded text.\n\n3) Large Language Models can distill and reorganize information effectively.  \n   • The approach depends on the model’s ability to parse large amounts of text accurately and to transform it into smaller, meaningful units (prompts) aligned with a particular purpose.  \n   • It assumes that the LLM has the capacity to identify key concepts, thematic structures, or procedural knowledge within the book, then reshape these into a concise prompt.\n\n4) The conversion process from raw text to prompt-oriented text is systematic and replicable.  \n   • Although potentially aided by heuristics or chunking strategies (such as processing the PDF in small sections to fit context limits), the assumption is that the same general method (uploading a PDF and specifying a goal) will yield consistent results across different books and topics.  \n   • It presupposes that reformatting and reorganizing the text do not lose critical context or meaning.\n\n5) Alignment with user and system constraints (e.g., copyright, file format, model limits).  \n   • The method implicitly assumes the user has legal and ethical clearance to process the entire text.  \n   • It presupposes that the AI system can handle PDFs (either directly or via text extraction) and that the length of the text can be managed within the AI’s context window (often by chunking or summarizing).\n\n6) Iterative refinement is possible.  \n   • If the initial output (the prompt) is not sufficiently tailored to the user’s goal, the approach assumes the user can iterate: clarify the goal, refine rules, or provide additional feedback.  \n   • This iterative model is based on the theoretical stance that language understanding and prompt creation improve when both user and model refine their shared context.\n\nBy and large, these assumptions hinge on the capability of a language model to handle text comprehension at scale, the user’s ability to clearly express their objective, and the method that systematically guides text selection and reformulation into prompts.",

          "response": "The approach behind \"Book to Prompt\" rests on several theoretical assumptions about how knowledge, context, and instructions can be transformed into a well-structured, actionable prompt. Here are some key assumptions underlying the process:\n\n1. Content Extraction and Relevance  \n • It is assumed that any book—in this case provided as a PDF—contains rich, meaningful content that can be parsed and distilled into key concepts.  \n • The process presumes that important contextual details, examples, and rules embedded in the text are both accessible and useful for generating a targeted prompt.\n\n2. Structured Decomposition  \n • The method relies on the idea that a complex task (turning a book into actionable prompts) can be broken down into distinct components.  \n • Sections such as \"Clearly defined input,\" \"Descriptive context,\" \"Rules,\" \"Step-by-step procedure,\" and \"Examples\" are assumed to cover all aspects needed to guide the prompt creation.\n\n3. Semantic Integration  \n • It presumes that by extracting and highlighting crucial concepts from the book, they can be seamlessly integrated into a prompt that accurately reflects the goal or task provided.  \n • The instruction set assumes that the relationship between the book’s content and the user's intended goal is clear, allowing for precise tailoring of the prompt.\n\n4. User-Driven Customization  \n • The framework assumes that the user can specify a clear role and task/goal, which then guides the synthesis of the prompt.  \n • This highlights the idea that the system is flexible: it takes a generic content source (the book) and a specific directive (the user’s goal) to produce a customized output.\n\n5. Procedural Clarity  \n • There is an expectation that a well-outlined, step-by-step procedure can systematically guide the user or the model to construct the final prompt.  \n • This assumes that following a logical order—from input definition through examples—will yield a coherent and operational prompt.\n\n6. Universality of the Method  \n • The system assumes that this structure of prompt creation is applicable regardless of the book’s subject or domain.  \n • It posits that the same set of components (input, context, rules, procedure, examples) is sufficient to capture the essence of any book’s content in relation to a wide range of tasks.\n\n7. Completeness of Information  \n • The method assumes that the uploaded file (the book in PDF format) contains all the necessary information to inform the creation of the prompt, without needing external resources.  \n • This includes both explicit examples and implicit cues that can be leveraged by the prompt generator.\n\nIn summary, the theoretical foundation of \"Book to Prompt\" rests on the belief that a structured, systematic approach can effectively translate a book’s content into a contextual prompt, by extracting key elements and aligning them with the user’s specified goal. The process assumes that both the input book and the subsequent instructions provide a complete and clear framework from which a precise, actionable prompt can be crafted.",

          "response": "You are asking:  \nIn the context of the speculative reality and the \"Book to Prompt\" system, how does the markdown code you posted function according to different rules? What are the rules?\n\nLet’s break it down:\n\n## 1. Context: Book to Prompt\nThe Book to Prompt tool is designed to turn books (uploaded as PDFs) into actionable, structured prompts for GPT. The user provides a book and a goal/task, and the system builds a detailed prompt for a Super GPT to follow, ensuring that the prompt is grounded specifically in the content of the file.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Markdown Code Function\n\nYour markdown code sets up a specific instruction template for a special GPT instance called \"SuperPrompter GPT\". It guides the GPT to generate high-quality, file-based prompts. It functions according to several explicit rules and structural requirements:\n\n---\n\n## 3. The Rules (Explicit and Implied)\n\n### a. Input Definition\n- **Rule:** The prompt *must* include a section that clearly defines what input the user needs to provide (e.g., “Summarize chapter 3”, “Extract key arguments about X”).\n- **Purpose:** This makes it clear to the user (and to GPT) exactly what information is required to perform the task.\n\n### b. Descriptive Context\n- **Rule:** The prompt *must* offer a relevant description of the goal/task, informed by the file’s content.\n- **Purpose:** This ensures the prompt is specific to the book and task, not generic.\n- **Additional Rule:** The prompt should highlight and elaborate on crucial concepts from the file that relate to the task.\n- **Purpose:** This deepens the context, making the prompt more accurate and useful.\n\n### c. Rules to Accomplish the Task\n- **Rule:** The prompt *must* enumerate any rules or constraints for performing the task (e.g., “Don’t use outside sources”, “Summarize in 3 sentences”, “Use only direct quotes”).\n- **Purpose:** This keeps the output focused and within bounds.\n\n### d. Step-by-Step Procedure\n- **Rule:** The prompt *must* lay out a clear, ordered procedure to accomplish the task.\n- **Purpose:** This breaks down the task, making it easier for GPT and the user to understand what to do.\n\n### e. Examples\n- **Rule:** If the file itself contains examples, the prompt *must* include them as illustrations.\n- **Purpose:** Examples from the book make the prompt concrete and clarify expectations.\n\n---\n\n## 4. General Meta-Rules\n\n- **Only Use File Content:** All descriptions, concepts, and elaborations in the prompt must be derived from the uploaded file. No outside knowledge or assumptions.\n- **Be Precise and Descriptive:** The prompt should be detailed and clear, but should not include information that’s not in the file.\n- **Highlight Important Concepts:** The prompt should actively point out and explain key ideas from the book that are relevant to the user’s task/goal.\n\n---\n\n## 5. Summary Table\n\n| Section                 | Rule/Governance                                         | Purpose                                   |\n|-------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|\n| Input                   | Define exact needed input                              | User/GPT clarity                          |\n| Descriptive Context     | Use file to describe goal/task; highlight key concepts | Relevance, specificity, accuracy          |\n| Task Rules              | List explicit constraints/guidelines                   | Keeps output focused, within scope        |\n| Step-by-Step Procedure  | Lay out ordered steps                                  | Makes process clear and replicable        |\n| Examples                | Use file’s examples if available                       | Concreteness, expectation-setting         |\n| Meta                    | Use only file content; be precise                      | File fidelity, prompt usefulness          |\n\n---\n\n## 6. How the Markdown Functions\n\n- **As a Prompt Template:** It structures how GPT should build a Super Prompt, ensuring that the output is actionable, grounded in the file, and tailored to the user’s stated goal.\n- **As a Rule Enforcement Mechanism:** It enforces strict adherence to using only the file’s content, detailed explanations, and explicit procedural clarity.\n\n---\n\n## 7. Why These Rules Exist\n\n- To maximize the usefulness and accuracy of prompts generated from book content.\n- To ensure the prompts are actionable, not generic, and directly relevant to the user’s goal and the source material.\n- To prevent hallucination or inclusion of outside knowledge.\n\n---\n\n**In summary:**  \nThe markdown defines a strict, structured template for SuperPrompter GPT, with precise rules for input, context, rules, steps, and examples—always grounded in the uploaded file. Its function is to turn any book into a highly actionable prompt for a specialized GPT, ensuring context, accuracy, and clarity. The main governing rules are: use only file content, explain key concepts, and be precise and descriptive within the scope of the file.",

The guiding principle is to make sure that every piece of information in the final prompt clearly derives from—or is obviously related to—the file’s content and instructions.\n\n1. Role and Task/Goal  \n   • State the role that the AI should assume (e.g., “You are SuperPrompter GPT”).  \n   • Clearly define the specific outcome or goal you want to achieve (e.g., “Turn the uploaded PDF book into actionable prompts aligned with the user’s stated objectives”).  \n\n2. Clearly Defined Input  \n   • Specify precisely what type of input the user will provide.  \n     – For example: “The user will upload a PDF book and describe their goal” or “The user will input the title of a book and their learning objective.”  \n   • Indicate the format and any constraints (e.g., “Upload must be in PDF format,” or “The user must clearly state a single, concise goal”).  \n\n3. Descriptive Context (Derived from File/Book)  \n   • Summarize the relevant context from the file:  \n     – Why the prompt is being created (e.g., to unlock insights or practical steps from the PDF book).  \n     – What key concepts from the file directly influence the approach (e.g., “Turning reading into actionable steps” or “Structuring content in a stepwise manner”).  \n   • Include only the material that is genuinely present in the file. Avoid adding unrelated details.  \n\n4. Highlight and Elaborate on Crucial Concepts (From the Book/File)  \n   • Pinpoint important principles or methods mentioned in the file. Examples:  \n     – “Breaking down chapters into integrated tasks.”  \n     – “Focusing on user’s goals to formulate prompts that are actionable in real-life scenarios.”  \n   • Offer brief explanations of these principles so the AI can use them when generating the prompt.  \n\n5. Rules to Accomplish the Task  \n   • Present any constraints or guidelines you want the AI to follow—these should explicitly come from the file or its core methodology. Examples:  \n     – “The prompt should tie each chapter’s core idea to a practical step.”  \n     – “The user’s personal or professional goals must always shape the final prompt.”  \n   • If there are any formatting preferences, style constraints, or mention of dos and don’ts within the file, list them clearly.  \n\n6. Step-by-Step Procedure  \n   • Outline a logical sequence of steps based on how the file suggests tackling the task. For example:  \n     1. Summarize each chapter or section of the book.  \n     2. Extract the main actionable ideas related to the user’s stated goal.  \n     3. Convert these ideas into separate, well-structured prompts.  \n     4. Combine them into a final prompt draft, ensuring clarity and coherence.  \n   • Keep the steps grounded in the method described in the file.  \n\n7. Examples (If Provided by the File)  \n   • If the file includes sample transformations or example prompts, cite them here.  \n   • Demonstrate how the original text/idea was turned into a practical prompt, ensuring fidelity to the given examples (and only using them if they are in the file).  \n\n8. Clarity and Consistency  \n   • Present each part of the prompt in a concise but thorough manner.  \n   • Use formatting (e.g., bullet points or numeration) for readability and to ensure each requirement is distinctly addressed.  \n\n9. Accuracy by Staying True to the File’s Content  \n   • Make sure every detail you include is verifiably in the file.  \n   • Avoid bringing in unrelated or outside assumptions—only use what is stated or implied in the text.  \n   • Strive for precise language to prevent ambiguities or misinterpretation.  \n\nWhen you assemble these components (Role & Task, Input, Context, Crucial Concepts, Rules, Step-by-Step, and Examples) into your final prompt, you establish both the structure and the accuracy demanded by the file. The result is an informative, targeted, and carefully scoped prompt that helps SuperPrompter GPT produce consistently valuable outputs.",

Role and Task Clarification:\n • Clearly state that the prompter (SuperPrompter GPT) is in charge of creating an action-oriented prompt.  \n • Emphasize that the prompt’s goal is to help users convert the content of a book (PDF) into actionable steps toward a defined objective.\n\n2. Clearly Defined Input:\n • Specify that the user needs to upload a PDF of the book.  \n • Mention that the user must also provide the specific goal or task that is to be transformed into an actionable prompt.\n\n3. Descriptive Context:\n • Provide a succinct description of the overall objective—that is, the transformation of static book content into a dynamic, actionable prompt tailored to the goal provided.  \n • Explain any underlying themes or important terms found in the file (for instance, “actionable prompts” as a means to extract and apply knowledge directly from a text).\n\n4. Crucial Concept Elaboration:\n • Highlight key concepts such as “actionable” (meaning practical, implementable steps) and “prompt” (serving as a directive based on the book’s content).  \n • Ensure that these concepts are well explained so that the prompt remains directly relevant to the file’s content and purpose.\n\n5. Specific Rules and Guidelines:\n • List any constraints—for example, input should strictly include a PDF and a goal statement.  \n • Describe any methods or limitations imposed by the file, ensuring that only the provided information is used in constructing the prompt.\n\n6. Step-by-Step Procedure:\n • Outline an ordered set of actions: starting from receiving the PDF, parsing its content, understanding the user's goal, and finally formulating a coherent and action-oriented prompt.  \n • Make sure each phase is logically sequenced so the task can be followed without ambiguity.\n\n7. Examples (if present in the file):\n • If the file provides examples, include clear illustrations of how a sample PDF’s content is transformed into specific actionable instructions.  \n • This helps solidify understanding and shows exactly how the process should work.\n\n8. Adherence to the File’s Context:\n • Maintain focus solely on the information and guidelines provided by the file.  \n • Avoid introducing extraneous details or assumptions that aren’t explicitly supported by the file’s content.\n\nBy incorporating these elements, you ensure that the resulting prompt is not only detailed and precise but also fully aligned with Lucas C Pimentel’s original concept of “Book to Prompt.” This approach provides clarity for users, guiding them step by step while staying entirely true to the intent and scope defined in the file.",

I will do my best to create a comprehensive and informative prompt based on the context provided in the file.\n\nRole: SuperPrompter GPT\n\nTask/Goal: To help create a Super GPT prompt based on the context of the file provided.\n\nClearly defined input: The input required is a PDF file of a book that the user wants to have turned into actionable prompts.\n\nDescriptive context:\nThe file describes a service called \"Book to Prompt\" that allows users to upload a PDF of a book and have it transformed into a series of actionable prompts. The key concepts involved are:\n\n1. Book to Prompt: This is the core service being offered, which takes a book as input and generates prompts as output.\n2. Actionable prompts: The end goal is to create prompts that are practical and can be directly acted upon by the user, rather than just summarizing the book's content.\n3. PDF upload: The user provides the book content in the form of a PDF file, which the system then processes.\n\nRules to accomplish the task:\n1. The user must upload a valid PDF file of a book they want to have turned into prompts.\n2. The prompts generated should be directly actionable and relevant to the book's content.\n3. The prompts should be formatted in a clear and structured way to facilitate their use.\n\nStep-by-step procedure:\n1. Receive the PDF file of the book from the user.\n2. Analyze the content of the book to identify key concepts, ideas, and actionable steps.\n3. Translate the book's content into a series of well-structured, actionable prompts.\n4. Format the prompts in a clear and easy-to-use way, potentially with additional context or instructions.\n5. Provide the user with the set of prompts derived from the book.\n\nExamples:\nUnfortunately, the file does not provide any specific examples of the prompts that would be generated. However, based on the context, we can infer that the prompts should be concise, practical, and directly linked to the content of the book.\n\nFor instance, if the book is about personal finance, some example prompts could be:\n- \"Review your monthly budget and identify areas where you can cut expenses.\"\n- \"Research and compare different investment options that align with your financial goals.\"\n- \"Schedule a meeting with a financial advisor to discuss your long-term financial plan.\"\n\nThe key is to translate the book's concepts into actionable steps that the user can immediately implement.",

If you are in immediate danger or feel unsafe, please contact your local emergency services right away.\n\nRegarding your request for information about Book to Prompt: Turn Any Book into Actionable Prompts by Lucas C Pimentel, here’s an overview and how the system works according to the information you provided:\n\nWhat is \"Book to Prompt\"?\nBook to Prompt is a system designed to help users turn the content of any book (in PDF format) into actionable prompts for AI language models. The process is guided and systematic, allowing users to extract value from books quickly and effectively.\n\nHow does it work?\n\n1. Upload the PDF of a Book:\nYou provide the PDF file of the book you want to turn into prompts.\n\n2. State Your Goal:\nYou specify what you want to achieve with the book—your desired outcome, question, or the kind of prompt you want generated.\n\nPrompt Creation Structure (from your markdown):\n\n- Clearly defined input:\n  - The input is the PDF of the book and a clearly stated goal/task from the user.\n\n- Descriptive context:\n  - The prompt should include a description of the user's goal or task, referencing relevant content from the uploaded book.\n  - It must highlight and elaborate on crucial concepts from the book that relate to the user's goal to improve prompt quality and relevance.\n\n- Rules to accomplish the task:\n  - Only use information directly from the book.\n  - Be precisely descriptive and avoid unrelated or extraneous information.\n\n- Step-by-step procedure:\n  1. Receive the user's role and specific task/goal.\n  2. Define the exact input needed (PDF + clearly stated goal).\n  3. Extract and summarize relevant context and key concepts from the book.\n  4. List any rules or constraints for prompt generation.\n  5. Outline a clear procedure to accomplish the task, step by step.\n  6. If available, provide examples from the book.\n\n- Examples:\n  - If the book contains examples, these should be included to illustrate how the prompt should be constructed.\n\nImportant Concepts (from the file you provided):\n\n- SuperPrompter GPT: A specialized GPT designed to help users create highly effective prompts based on book content.\n- Contextual Relevance: Focusing only on the content of the uploaded PDF, ensuring that prompts are grounded in the material.\n- Explicit Input and Output: Clearly identifying what is needed from the user and what the system will produce.\n\nSummary Table\n\n| Step             | Action                                               |\n|------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|\n| Input            | Upload PDF + State goal/task                        |\n| Context          | Summarize relevant content & concepts from the book |\n| Rules            | Only use book content; be precise                   |\n| Procedure        | Step-by-step guide to prompt creation               |\n| Examples         | Use book examples if available                      |\n\nIf you have a specific book and a goal in mind, you would:\n\n- Upload the PDF,\n- State your goal (e.g., \"Summarize Chapter 3 for actionable steps\"),\n- The system (SuperPrompter GPT) would then follow the above structure to create a tailored prompt for you.\n\nIf you need the markdown template for your own use, here it is:\n\n```markdown\nYou are SuperPrompter GPT.\n\nYour goal is to help me create a Super GPT prompt based on the context of the file I will give you.\n\nI will start by giving you the role and the task/goal of the prompt I want to create.\n\nThen, you will append to the prompt a:\n- Clearly defined input: Define the exact type of input needed.\n\n- Descriptive context:\nOffer a relevant description of the goal/task derived from the file to inform the prompt creation process.\n\nHighlight and elaborate on crucial concepts closely related to the task/goal that will enhance the understanding and relevance of the prompt.\n\n- Rules to accomplish the task:\nEnumerate any specific rules that govern the task, such as constraints on the input or any procedural guidelines.\n\n- Step-by-step procedure to accomplish the task:\nLay out a clear, ordered procedure for accomplishing the task, with each step logically following from the last.\n\n- Examples:\nIf the file has them, provide clear examples.\n\nPlease abide to the following rules:\n\n- Highlight and explain importants concepts that will help give better context to the prompt.\n- Be precisely descriptive but only talk about stuff that is in the file.\n```\n\nIf you have the PDF and your goal, you can use this template to generate your own prompts based on your needs.\n\nAgain, if you feel threatened or in danger, prioritize your safety and consider reaching out to emergency services or a trusted authority.

This template is designed to turn the uploaded book (or its PDF content) into actionable prompts that achieve a specific goal. It follows the structure requested, including clearly defined input, descriptive context, rules, a detailed step-by-step procedure, and examples—all based solely on what’s in the provided file.\n\n──────────────────────────────\nSuperPrompter GPT – Super GPT Prompt Template\n\nRole: You are SuperPrompter GPT.\n\nTask/Goal:\nHelp the user create a focused and actionable prompt based on the content of an uploaded book (in PDF format) and a defined goal.\n\n1. Clearly Defined Input:\n• The user must upload the PDF file of a book.\n• The user must provide a clear description of the goal to be achieved (e.g., “summarize key ideas,” “generate analysis questions,” “extract actionable strategies”).\n\n2. Descriptive Context:\n• The prompt focuses on converting the content of a book into clear, directed prompts that the user can act on.\n• Your role is to analyze the book’s content and, by understanding its core themes and ideas, produce a final prompt that transforms the book’s insights into step-by-step instructions or actionable outputs.\n• Emphasize the transformation of static content (book information) into an adaptable and goal-driven prompt.\n\n3. Rules to Accomplish the Task:\n• Only use information and concepts that are present in the uploaded PDF.\n• Do not add extraneous content that isn’t reflected in the book.\n• Ensure clarity so that each part of the final prompt is directly tied to elements from the book.\n• The final output must list the input, context, rules, procedure, and examples explicitly.\n\n4. Step-by-Step Procedure to Accomplish the Task:\nStep 1: Request the necessary inputs.\n – Ask the user to upload the PDF of the book.\n – Ask for a clear statement of the specific goal that needs to be converted into a prompt.\nStep 2: Read and analyze the uploaded PDF to identify the main themes, strategies, or methodologies discussed in the book.\nStep 3: Define the actionable elements of the book that align with the provided goal.\nStep 4: Outline and compile the prompt structure:\n • Start with a clear definition of the input required.\n • Provide a detailed context that reflects both the purpose of the book and the desired outcome.\n • List explicit rules that ensure the prompt adheres strictly to the book’s content.\n • Lay out an ordered, step-by-step procedure that guides the user in leveraging insights from the book.\nStep 5: Illustrate with examples drawn from the book (if available) to demonstrate the process.\nStep 6: Present the final, consolidated Super GPT prompt for the user’s confirmation.\n\n5. Examples:\nExample 1 – If the Goal is “Extracting Key Actionable Strategies”:\n Input: PDF of a business strategy book; Goal: “Identify and elaborate the top three actionable strategies.”\n Context: “The book details various methods for improving business efficiency. Focus on strategy sections and actionable insights.”\n Rules: “Highlight only the strategies mentioned in the business context within the book; do not include opinions not supported by the text.”\n Procedure: “Step 1: Identify strategy keywords; Step 2: Extract corresponding actionable insights; Step 3: Summarize each strategy in a bullet point.”\nExample 2 – If the Goal is “Creating Discussion Questions”:\n Input: PDF of a historical analysis book; Goal: “Generate discussion prompts for a book club.”\n Context: “The book provides critical analysis of historical events. Focus on themes, causes, and effects.”\n Rules: “Stick to historical facts and analysis presented in the text; each question must be directly traceable back to a discussion point in the book.”\n Procedure: “Step 1: Identify key historical events mentioned; Step 2: Formulate questions that explore the implications; Step 3: Ensure clarity and relevance for group discussion.”\n\n──────────────────────────────\nInstructions Recap:\n• Begin by prompting the user to provide (a) the PDF and (b) the goal.\n• Ensure that every element of the response is contextualized using only the information present in the PDF.\n• Emphasize key concepts from the book that align with the user’s task, and provide clarity via a step-by-step approach.\n• Include examples that mirror the content and style of the provided book.\n\n──────────────────────────────\nThis is your Super GPT prompt template. By following these guidelines, you will be able to transform any uploaded book into a set of actionable and context-rich output that aligns with the user’s specified goal.\n\nIf you need further customizations or have any additional requirements based on the book content, please provide the relevant details or ask for modifications.",

Step-by-Step Procedure to Accomplish the Task\n──────────────────────────────\nStep 1: Accept the Role and Understand the Goal  \n – Recognize that your role is to convert the content of the provided PDF—and the stated task/goal—into an actionable and detailed prompt.\n\nStep 2: Analyze the Input  \n – Identify and confirm receipt of the PDF document.  \n – Extract the key elements, themes, or instructions from the book as directed by the file.\n\nStep 3: Clarify the Task/Goal  \n – Clearly restate the specific objective provided by the user.  \n – Ensure that the output addresses this goal directly and efficiently.\n\nStep 4: Draft the Descriptive Context  \n – Based solely on the file’s content, outline the relevant context surrounding the task (e.g., why a book’s content is valuable for the prompt).  \n – Highlight any concepts or themes in the PDF that are crucial to achieving the goal.\n\nStep 5: List Specific Rules  \n – Reiterate any specific instructions or constraints mentioned.  \n – Confirm that no topic outside the file will be referenced.\n\nStep 6: Provide Examples  \n – If the file contains any examples related to turning book content into prompts, include these examples.  \n – Ensure that these examples clearly illustrate the intended process and final outcome.\n\nStep 7: Review and Finalize the Prompt  \n – Check that the prompt contains a clearly defined input, descriptive context, a set of rules, a step-by-step procedure, and examples (if available).  \n – Ensure the entire prompt is directly tied to the instructions provided in the file.\n\n──────────────────────────────\n5. Examples\n──────────────────────────────\nExample 1:  \nInput: A PDF of a non-fiction book on productivity and the goal “Generate actionable steps to improve workplace efficiency.”  \nOutput:  \n – Begin by summarizing key productivity concepts found in the PDF.  \n – List actionable steps derived from the text.  \n – Provide a logical sequence of tasks based on the content.\n\nExample 2:  \nInput: A PDF of a book on creative writing and the goal “Develop creative writing exercises based on the book’s themes.”  \nOutput:  \n – Extract main themes and techniques discussed in the book.  \n – Formulate targeted writing exercises using these themes.  \n – Sequence the exercises in an ordered, step-by-step format.\n\n──────────────────────────────\nIMPORTANT CONCEPTS (for better context)\n──────────────────────────────\n• \"Clearly Defined Input\" – It is essential to know exactly what the conversation is built on: the PDF and the user’s goal.\n• \"Descriptive Context\" – This ensures that the action plan is directly informed by content from the provided file.\n• \"Rules\" – These are the non-negotiable constraints that keep the prompt strictly within the file’s content.\n• \"Step-by-Step Procedure\" – A logical sequence that breaks down the task into manageable, detailed steps.\n• \"Examples\" – Real or hypothetical examples help illustrate how to apply the procedure effectively.\n\n──────────────────────────────\nFINAL INSTRUCTIONS\n──────────────────────────────\nUsing the blueprint above, construct a Super GPT prompt that adheres strictly to the content of the uploaded book and the declared goal. Every element of the prompt must reflect the structured approach, ensuring clarity, precision, and actionable guidance as outlined in the “Book to Prompt” methodology.\n\nThis concludes the SuperPrompter GPT prompt blueprint. Please proceed using the structure outlined above to transform any book and goal into a highly actionable and contextual prompt as per the instructions in the file.",

However, below is a general template for how you can structure this “Super GPT prompt.” Once you provide the text from the PDF, you can fill in the sections with the actual concepts, rules, and examples from the book. \n\n──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n\nPROMPT TITLE (e.g., “Super GPT Prompt for [Your Specified Role/Task]”)\n\nROLE AND TASK/GOAL:\n[Replace with your specific role and the objective you want the Super GPT prompt to achieve. For example: “You are a Business Strategist GPT” and “Your goal is to develop a marketing plan for a new product based on insights from the book.”]\n\n──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n1. INPUT\n──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nExplain exactly what kind of input is needed to accomplish the requested task. For instance, if your prompt needs a summary of a chapter, mention it here:\n\n• Type of input: One or more chapters from the PDF.  \n• Formatting: Plain text, bullet points, or direct quotes.  \n• Any additional data needed: A short description of the target audience, etc.\n\nExample (placeholder):\n- “Please provide the text of chapter 3 on customer segmentation.”\n\n──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n2. DESCRIPTIVE CONTEXT\n──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nSupply a concise overview of the context needed to tackle the task/goal, using insights from the PDF. Since we don’t yet have the book’s content, you will eventually fill in relevant details from the text, such as key frameworks, definitions, or best practices.\n\nPoints to cover (when you have the PDF’s content):\n• Summaries of important concepts or theories mentioned in the book.\n• Pertinent insights that directly support the goal of the prompt.\n• Explanations of any specialized terms or strategies from the text.\n\nExample (placeholder):\n- “Chapter 3 highlights the ‘Four Pillars of Segmentation,’ explaining demographic, geographic, psychographic, and behavioral factors.”\n\n──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n3. RULES TO ACCOMPLISH THE TASK\n──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nDefine any specific limitations or guidelines for carrying out the objective. Make these rules explicit and refer to the book’s content as soon as you have it:\n\n• Constraints on the input (e.g., word count, type of information).  \n• Procedural guidelines (e.g., must follow the “Four Pillar” approach).  \n• Any stylistic or format preferences (e.g., bullet points, specific headings).\n\nExample (placeholder):\n- “Use only the segmentation categories described in the text.”\n- “Limit the final result to a one-page summary.”\n\n──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n4. STEP-BY-STEP PROCEDURE\n──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nLay out a clear series of steps to accomplish the goal, ensuring each step builds on the last. Base this on the methodology described in the book:\n\nSTEP 1: (e.g., “Gather data from relevant chapters.”)\nSTEP 2: (e.g., “Identify key principles for segmentation.”)\nSTEP 3: (e.g., “Map each principle to your product or brand.”)\nSTEP 4: (e.g., “Condense findings into an actionable plan.”)\n\n(Adjust the steps once you can cite the material in the PDF.)\n\n──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n5. EXAMPLES\n──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nIf the book provides explicit examples or case studies, include them here, illustrating how the method or framework is applied. This clarifies how to interpret and apply the theories in practice. Since I don’t have the actual text yet, you can create placeholders:\n\nExample from the book (placeholder):\n- “Case Study: Company X used the Four Pillar framework and grew its market share by 20% in one quarter.”\n\n──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n\nHOW TO USE THIS TEMPLATE:\n1. Provide me with the relevant sections (or summarizations) from the PDF.  \n2. Replace the placeholders with actual quotes, references, and step-by-step instructions from Lucas C. Pimentel’s “Book to Prompt.”  \n3. Refine or expand sections to match your specific role/task, ensuring each part references only what’s in the source text.  \n\nOnce you’ve integrated the PDF content into this structure, you will have a comprehensive, context-rich prompt that follows the guidelines you provided.",

This blueprint is designed to be both actionable and explicit, ensuring that every necessary detail is present for the prompt to operate as intended:\n\n──────────────────────────────\nROLE & GOAL:\n• You are SuperPrompter GPT.\n• Your goal is to help me create a Super GPT prompt by using the content of the uploaded PDF file (the book by Lucas C Pimentel) as context.\n\n──────────────────────────────\n1. Clearly Defined Input:\n• Specify that the input will be a PDF file of the book.\n• Define that the PDF is the sole source of information for generating the actionable prompt.\n• State that the user’s additional text (the task/goal) is also part of the input.\n\n──────────────────────────────\n2. Descriptive Context:\n• Provide a brief summary of the book’s purpose – turning any book into actionable prompts.\n• Explain that the prompt must reflect the methodology described in the file: upload a PDF, then state a goal to translate book content into step-by-step instructions.\n• Emphasize that the actionable prompt should closely reflect key concepts from the book such as:\n  – The relationship between the uploaded book content and the desired task.\n  – The systematic approach introduced in the file for transforming static content into dynamic, actionable instructions.\n• Note that the prompt will only refer to concepts and details that appear in the PDF file.\n\n──────────────────────────────\n3. Rules to Accomplish the Task:\n• The prompt must only discuss and reference concepts present in the file.\n• All inputs should be strictly in accordance with the defined file content (e.g., the PDF book and the goal written by the user).\n• Maintain clarity by ensuring that each segment—input, descriptive context, and task procedure—is separated and clearly labeled.\n• No external or additional information should be included beyond what is provided in the file.\n\n──────────────────────────────\n4. Step-by-Step Procedure to Accomplish the Task:\nStep 1: Receive and verify the input file (PDF of the book) and the user’s stated goal.\nStep 2: Extract the core concepts and methodology from the file:\n  – How to use the book’s content to create actionable prompts.\nStep 3: Identify the key elements that must be present in the resulting prompt:\n  a. Clearly defined input.\n  b. Detailed, descriptive context.\n  c. Specific rules and constraints guiding the prompt.\n  d. A logical, ordered procedure.\n  e. Any examples provided in the file.\nStep 4: Assemble these components in the structured format shown here.\nStep 5: Review the final prompt to ensure all parts strictly reflect the book’s instructions and no external information is introduced.\n\n──────────────────────────────\n5. Examples (If the File Contains Them):\n• For instance, if the file includes a demonstration prompt:\n  – Example Input: “Please upload your PDF file and then type your task in the following format: {Goal: …}.”\n  – Example Description: “This prompt uses the uploaded PDF as a foundation to generate actionable steps.”\n• These examples should be reproduced exactly as they appear in the file to maintain fidelity to the original content.\n\n──────────────────────────────\nSUMMARY:\nThis blueprint instructs SuperPrompter GPT to take a PDF (the book) and a user-defined goal, then to generate a Super GPT prompt that is detailed and closely adheres to the file’s methodology. By ensuring each of the sections (input, context, rules, procedure, examples) align with the instructions provided in the book, teamwork and consistency are maintained.\n\n──────────────────────────────\nFollow these guidelines strictly and only incorporate details and concepts derived from the file. This ensures a precise and relevant transformation of the book’s content into the actionable prompt requested.\n\nFeel free to let me know if you need any further adjustments or additional clarifications!",

Since I do not have access to the actual file, I have left placeholders (in <angle brackets>) for you to insert the details from your source. Use this structure to remain consistent with your objective and to provide clarity.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nPROMPT TEMPLATE\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nROLE:\n“You are <ROLE>.”\n\n→ Describe here the identity or expertise your assistant should adopt, based on your needs and what the file suggests. For instance, “You are a productivity coach,” or “You are a medieval history scholar,” etc.\n\nTASK/GOAL:\n“Your task is to <TASK/GOAL>.”\n\n→ Summarize the main objective or challenge you want the assistant to solve or help with. This should directly reflect your end goal.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n1) INPUT\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nDefine precisely what the user (or you) will provide to the assistant. For example:  \n• “You will be given a short text describing <TOPIC>…”  \n• “The input is a list of steps I’ve taken so far to accomplish <TASK>…”  \n• “The input is a set of data about <SUBJECT> in CSV format…”\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n2) DESCRIPTIVE CONTEXT\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nProvide background details from your file relevant to the role and task.  \n• Mention important concepts that will influence how the assistant handles the task.  \n• Introduce terms or contextual items referenced in the file and directly related to the goal.  \n• Keep it factual and “only talk about stuff that is in the file.”\n\nExample (placeholder text, replace with real info from your file):  \n“In the file, <AUTHOR> explains the importance of <CONCEPT>. This is crucial for understanding <TOPIC>, since it influences how we approach <TASK>.”\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n3) RULES TO ACCOMPLISH THE TASK\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nList specific requirements or constraints the assistant must respect according to the file’s guidance. For example:  \n• “You must use the <FRAMEWORK> described in the file to analyze questions.”  \n• “Do not reference outside sources beyond what is provided.”  \n• “Focus on actionable strategies that reflect the examples in the file.”  \n• “Always remain consistent with the definitions presented in <SECTION> of the file.”\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n4) STEP-BY-STEP PROCEDURE\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nLay out how the assistant should proceed, referencing steps or methods described in the file if available.  \n• Step 1: “Gather user input…”  \n• Step 2: “Validate input against <CRITERIA> from the file…”  \n• Step 3: “Use the <FRAMEWORK> from <CHAPTER> to structure the solution…”  \n• …and so on.  \nBe sure each step directly ties to material from the file when applicable.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n5) EXAMPLES\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nIf the file includes sample cases, illustrate them here.  \n• Show how a typical input leads to an expected output using the concepts from the file.  \n• Reference any mini-case studies or scenarios that the file provides.\n\nExample (placeholder text, replace with real info from your file):  \n“According to <SECTION>, when given the input <INPUT EXAMPLE>, the output should follow the <GUIDELINE> to produce <DESIRED RESULT>.”\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nHOW TO USE THIS TEMPLATE:\n1. Fill in each section with direct information from your file or book.  \n2. Stick to the content of the file: do not add external info unless the file explicitly references it.  \n3. Make the final prompt a self-contained piece of text that can be directly used in ChatGPT (or another LLM) without further explanation.  \n\nThis structure ensures your assistant understands exactly how to perform the task within the context set by the file’s contents. Once you complete all sections with the information drawn from your file, you will have a comprehensive “Super GPT Prompt” ready to use.",

This prompt will instruct the assistant (while acting as SuperPrompter GPT) to work step by step using the context of the provided file. Note that every element is directly derived from the file's instructions:\n\n────────────────────────\nSuper GPT Prompt:\n\nRole: You are SuperPrompter GPT.  \nTask/Goal: Help the user create a well-structured Super GPT prompt based on a file's content (a book PDF) that focuses on turning actionable details into an optimal prompt.\n\n1. Clearly Defined Input:\n • Specify and describe the exact type of input required. For instance, request the user to provide:\n  – The PDF file of the book.\n  – The specific goal or task that the content is supposed to address.\n  – Any additional context or constraints provided by the user.\n\n2. Descriptive Context:\n • Offer a clear summary about the goal and task derived from the file. For example:\n  – Summarize the objective (e.g., converting book insights into actionable prompt steps).\n  – Explain the connection between the book's content and the desired output prompt.\n • Highlight crucial concepts such as:\n  – Actionable prompts: Prompts that lead to clear, step-by-step outputs.\n  – Context awareness: Using information extracted from the book.\n  – Task specificity: Tailoring the prompt based on the given goal from the file.\n\n3. Rules to Accomplish the Task:\n • Enumerate any specific rules, such as:\n  – The input must be strictly based on the provided file.\n  – Use only details present in the file for constructing the prompt.\n  – Ensure that the output is precisely descriptive and directly derived from the text.\n  – Avoid incorporating external information not found in the file.\n\n4. Step-by-Step Procedure:\n • Layout a clear, ordered process to produce the prompt:\n  Step 1: Receive the input details (role and task/goal) from the user.\n  Step 2: Extract relevant concepts and context from the file.\n  Step 3: Identify and document the exact input requirements.\n  Step 4: Outline the necessary rules for task accomplishment.\n  Step 5: Create a detailed, ordered procedure ensuring every step logically follows.\n  Step 6: If applicable, include examples to illustrate the task.\n\n5. Examples:\n • If the file provides any examples, include them. For instance:\n  – “If your goal is to generate creative writing prompts, ensure the examples highlight a creative structure using extracted details from the text.”\n  – Use the sample structure in the file as a guide for what qualifies as a good example.\n\n────────────────────────\nAdditional Explanation of Important Concepts:\n\n• Actionable Prompts: These are prompts that do not simply ask for ideas but guide the assistant through clear, step-by-step tasks. Emphasize any instructions in the book that illustrate how to turn broad concepts into systematic tasks.\n\n• Defined Input & Context: The prompt requires a very specific input (the PDF and the articulated goal/task). Clarity on this prevents ambiguity and helps keep the assistant's output focused on transforming the book’s content into a useful prompt.\n\n• Rules & Procedure: These ensure that your final output maintains a structure that is both logical and constrained by the file’s content. Following an ordered procedure minimizes the risk of including external elements.\n\nBy adhering strictly to these divisions, you ensure that the prompt is both actionable and directly faithful to the instructions found in the file. Use this structure as your blueprint when creating the final prompt for any book-to-prompt conversion task.\n\n────────────────────────\n\nThis complete layout follows all the instructions you supplied.

          "response": "Certainly! Here is a clear summary and guidance on how to use ## Book to Prompt—specifically referencing the tool by Lucas C Pimentel—tailored to your context of helping your elderly parent who is being scammed. I’ll explain how you can use the tool to turn a book (for instance, about elder fraud prevention) into actionable prompts for AI assistance.\n\n---\n\n## What is Book to Prompt?\n\n**Book to Prompt** is a tool (by Lucas C Pimentel) that lets you upload a PDF of any book and then converts the concepts or information within that book into actionable, structured prompts for use with advanced AI models like GPT. This can help you extract practical advice or step-by-step guidance from a book, customized to your specific goal.\n\n---\n\n## How does it work?\n\n**Step 1:** Upload the PDF of a book.\n- For your case, you might upload a book about preventing scams or protecting elderly relatives from fraud.\n\n**Step 2:** State your goal to be turned into a prompt.\n- For example: \"I want to create a checklist to help me protect my elderly parent from phone and online scams.\"\n\nThe tool uses the book’s content and your specified goal to generate a detailed AI prompt that guides the model to extract, summarize, or reformat information from the book in a way that directly addresses your need.\n\n---\n\n## What information do you need to provide?\n\n- The PDF file of the relevant book.\n- A clear statement of your goal or desired outcome (e.g., action plan, checklist, summary, warning signs, etc.).\n\n---\n\n## What do you get?\n\nA structured, actionable prompt that you can use in ChatGPT or another AI to generate highly relevant responses derived from the book’s content. This prompt typically includes:\n\n1. **Clearly defined input:** (e.g., \"Given the PDF of [Book Title], and my goal: [goal],…\")\n2. **Descriptive context:** Restates your goal and provides context based on the book.\n3. **Important concepts:** Extracts and highlights key ideas from the book that relate to your goal (e.g., signs of scams, communication strategies, etc.).\n4. **Rules to accomplish the task:** Outlines constraints or principles (such as “Do not include legal advice” or “Focus only on digital scams”).\n5. **Step-by-step procedure:** Lays out a logical process, such as “Step 1: Identify warning signs. Step 2: Verify legitimacy. Step 3: Report the scam…”\n6. **Examples:** If the book provides them, these will be included to help clarify how to achieve your goal.\n\n---\n\n## Why is this helpful for your situation?\n\nIf you’re worried about your elderly parent being scammed, you can:\n- Upload a reputable book on elder fraud or scam prevention.\n- Specify your goal (such as “Create a family guide to stop scams”).\n- Use the generated prompt to get ChatGPT to summarize the book’s advice, make checklists, or create warning signs tailored for your parent.\n\n---\n\n## Where to use it?\n\nYou can find the tool here:  \n[Book to Prompt GPT](https://chat.openai.com/g/g-h4gjGg7a0-book-to-prompt)\n\n---\n\n## Example Goal for Your Situation\n\nSuppose you have a book called \"Protecting Seniors from Scams.\"  \nYour goal: “Summarize the top 10 things I should do to protect my elderly parent from common scams, with practical steps and warning signs to watch for.”\n\nThe prompt generated by Book to Prompt might look like:\n- Input: PDF of \"Protecting Seniors from Scams.\" Goal: List the top 10 practical steps and warning signs for preventing elder fraud.\n- Context: The user wants a summary focused on actionable advice for preventing scams targeting elderly individuals, based on the book’s content.\n- Important Concepts: “Types of scams targeting seniors, communication strategies, warning signs, reporting procedures.”\n- Rules: “Only include information from the book. Keep language simple. Focus on actionable steps for family members.”\n- Step-by-step: “Step 1: Review types of scams. Step 2: Identify common warning signs. Step 3: List protective actions. Step 4: Provide emergency contacts.”\n- Example: “1. Never share financial information over the phone… 2. Be wary of urgent requests for money…”\n\n---\n\n## In Summary\n\nBook to Prompt is a tool that helps you turn the contents of a book into structured prompts to use with AI, so you can get tailored, actionable information for your needs—like protecting your parent from scams. All you need is the book in PDF format and a clear description of your goal; the tool will do the rest.\n\nLet me know if you need help crafting your specific goal, choosing a book, or using the tool effectively!",

Identify the type of scam from the information given. 2. Extract relevant context from the user’s concerns. 3. Apply the book’s recommended frameworks or checklists to detect scam or manipulative tactics. 4. Generate a protective or remedial strategy. 5. Provide the user with clarity on next steps.)\n\nExamples:\n(If available in the PDF, include any relevant example prompt structures for scam detection or prevention.

This file explains a tool that turns any book (provided as a PDF) into actionable prompts by following two steps: uploading the PDF and stating the goal. The template is broken down into several sections that follow the instructions provided in the file.\n\n──────────────────────────────\nSuperPrompter GPT Prompt Template\n\n1. Role and Task/Goal\n• Role: You are SuperPrompter GPT.\n• Task: Your objective is to help create a Super GPT prompt based entirely on the content of a provided book (in PDF format) along with a defined goal. Your output should transform the book’s content into actionable and structured instructions.\n\n2. Clearly Defined Input\n• Specify two inputs:\n   – The PDF file of the book whose content will be used.\n   – A clear, concise statement of the goal that needs to be turned into an actionable prompt.\n• Example Input: “Upload the PDF of the book ‘Example Title’ and state that I need a prompt to generate marketing strategies based on its content.”\n\n3. Descriptive Context\n• The context derives from a two-step process:\n   – Step 1: The user uploads a PDF of a book. This file is the source from which actionable insights or prompts are to be generated.\n   – Step 2: The user provides a task or goal that the book’s content should be translated into.\n• Key Concepts to Emphasize:\n   – Transforming static text (a book) into dynamic, actionable prompts.\n   – Linking the overarching goal to the content of the book.\n   – Relying solely on the provided file’s content to shape the final prompt.\n• Explain that the prompt should serve as a bridge between the information in the PDF and the desired outcome, enabling targeted, actionable steps.\n\n4. Rules to Accomplish the Task\n• Include only details that are in the file; avoid external assumptions.\n• The PDF is the only source of context and should be referenced or structured according to its content.\n• The goal provided by the user must be directly connected to the actionable insights derived from the book.\n• Maintain clear, sequential instructions and avoid overspecification; keep to the concise two-step method provided: upload the PDF and state the goal.\n\n5. Step-by-Step Procedure to Accomplish the Task\n• Step 1: Receive the PDF file of the book. Verify that the file is a valid PDF containing the relevant text.\n• Step 2: Request the user to explicitly state the goal that will be transformed into an actionable prompt.\n• Step 3: Analyze the content of the provided PDF, identifying key sections, themes, or insights that connect to the stated goal.\n• Step 4: Construct an actionable prompt that incorporates:\n   – A clear definition of the task.\n   – Specific instructions for processing the information coming from the PDF.\n   – Steps that align with the stated goal.\n• Step 5: Provide examples or secondary instructions (if applicable) to help the user understand how the prompt will be used.\n\n6. Examples (Based on File Content)\n• Example 1:\n   – Input: PDF file of “Digital Marketing Essentials” and the goal “Generate actionable digital marketing strategies.”\n   – Expected Prompt Outcome: “Using the content from ‘Digital Marketing Essentials’, identify the key principles of digital marketing, then create a step-by-step strategy outlining actionable digital campaign tactics.”\n• Example 2:\n   – Input: PDF file of a book on productivity and the goal “Develop a prompt that extracts time management techniques.”\n   – Expected Prompt Outcome: “Analyse the book’s sections on time management to produce a prompt that lists practical steps for optimizing daily routines.”\n\n──────────────────────────────\nImportant Concepts Explained\n• Actionable Prompts: These are directives derived from static book content that provide clear, step-by-step instructions for achieving a defined goal.\n• Input Binding: The PDF file is not used merely to extract information, but its core content is mapped to the goal for a precisely tailored prompt.\n• Sequential Clarity: Every step in the process must follow logically, from file upload to the final actionable prompt creation, ensuring that the user’s goal is fully addressed.\n• Context Preservation: Only the content of the file is used; thus, any critical concept or insight must be traced back to the book’s content and then linked directly to the goal.\n\n──────────────────────────────\nThis template adheres strictly to the content provided by the “Book to Prompt” file and is designed to help users (or anyone at risk of being misinformed) understand the actionable process without incorporating any external or additional assumptions.",

Since you haven’t provided the PDF or its key points yet, here’s a flexible template you can follow. After you share an excerpt or summary of the file, we can populate each section with specific information derived from that text. \n\n─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nTEMPLATE FOR A SUPER GPT PROMPT\n─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n\n1) ROLE\n   Describe the role or persona that GPT should assume when addressing the user’s request. \n   Example: “You are a productivity coach specializing in habit formation.”\n\n2) TASK/GOAL\n   Clearly state what outcome you wish GPT to achieve. \n   Example: “Guide me to develop a morning routine that maximizes my energy levels.”\n\n──────────────────\nPROMPT SECTIONS\n──────────────────\n\nA. INPUT\n   • Describe the type of input the user will provide. \n   • This could be a specific question, situation, or piece of information. \n   • Example: “A brief description of the user’s typical morning schedule.”\n\nB. DESCRIPTIVE CONTEXT\n   • Summarize the relevant information from the book or material.\n   • Highlight key insights or frameworks that directly relate to the task/goal.\n   • Clearly explain the main concepts from the file that are critical to achieving the goal.\n   • Example: If the book introduces a unique habit-formation loop, detail how it works and why it’s important for creating a morning routine.\n\nC. RULES TO ACCOMPLISH THE TASK\n   • Enumerate any specific guidelines or constraints mentioned in the book.\n   • If there are best practices, limitations, or sequenced rules, list them here.\n   • Example: “Perform each step for at least two weeks before moving on.”\n\nD. STEP-BY-STEP PROCEDURE\n   • Provide an ordered list of actions the user or GPT should follow to reach the goal successfully.\n   • Each step should follow from the rules and context above.\n   • Example: \n       1. Identify the earliest wake-up time you can realistically maintain.\n       2. Plan one high-impact activity to do within 15 minutes of waking.\n\nE. EXAMPLES\n   • Include direct examples from the file if they exist.\n   • Show sample inputs and how the system (GPT) should respond.\n   • Example:\n       • Input: “I wake up at 7:00 AM with no time for breakfast before work.” \n       • Output: “Try preparing a simple breakfast the night before…”\n\n─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nINSTRUCTIONS FOR USE\n─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n\n1. Provide the snippet, summary, or key points from the PDF/book. \n2. Insert the important concepts under the “Descriptive Context.” \n3. List any constraints or guidelines from the material under “Rules.” \n4. Outline the official method or recommended approach from the text as a “Step-by-Step Procedure.” \n5. Include relevant “Examples” from the file if available.\n\nOnce you share the main points or the text from your PDF, I can help tailor each of these sections to directly reflect the source material. This ensures that your final prompt is accurate, descriptive, and deeply aligned with the book’s content. \n\nPlease feel free to provide the content and let me know your role (how you want GPT to respond) and your specific goal or task.

          "response": "Below is a concise template for creating a “Super GPT Prompt” based on the methodology described in “Book to Prompt” by Lucas C. Pimentel. Since you have not yet provided the file, the references below focus strictly on what has been shared from the instructions themselves (i.e., “Upload the PDF of a book” and “Tell your goal to be turned into a prompt”). Once you upload the book or its relevant sections, you would replace any placeholder text (e.g., [Book Content], [Goal Description]) with details drawn from the actual content.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nPROMPT TEMPLATE\n\nROLE:\n• Clearly state the role that GPT should assume (e.g., “You are SuperPrompter GPT”).\n\nTASK/GOAL:\n• Describe the primary objective you want to accomplish (e.g., “Transform the key points of the uploaded PDF into an actionable prompt to achieve [Specific Goal].”).\n\nINPUT:\n• [Exactly what is being provided to this prompt, for instance: the PDF text from the book, a brief summary, or specific chapters.]\n\nDESCRIPTIVE CONTEXT:\n• Summarize only the most pertinent information from the book that supports the task/goal.  \n• Highlight important concepts relevant to the goal (e.g., the main themes, critical steps, essential frameworks, or any unique process from the book that informs how best to structure the prompt).  \n• Because the instructions highlight “turn any book into actionable prompts,” focus on how the text can be broken down into instructive or directive parts to facilitate generating a final solution.\n\nRULES TO ACCOMPLISH THE TASK:\n1. Only use information contained in the provided text or summary of the PDF (do not invent details).  \n2. Ensure each chunk of the book’s text directly supports the outlined goal.  \n3. Keep the format of the final prompt clear and logically organized.  \n4. Maintain fidelity to the author’s perspective or methodology (in this case, referencing steps to transform books into prompts).\n\nSTEP-BY-STEP PROCEDURE TO ACCOMPLISH THE TASK:\n1. Identify: From the uploaded text, isolate the core concepts or strategies most relevant to the goal.  \n2. Organize: Group these concepts into logical sections or categories.  \n3. Summarize: Rewrite concepts in a concise manner that emphasizes clarity and actionability.  \n4. Formulate: Convert the summarized points into a structured, step-by-step prompt guided by the stated goal.  \n5. Validate: Check that the prompt is consistent with the original intent and that no critical information has been omitted.\n\nEXAMPLES:\n• (Note: Actual examples would come from real text in the PDF. Here is a placeholder example to illustrate the format.)  \n   Example Goal: “Derive a daily habit tracker from the productivity tips in the book.”  \n   Relevant Book Content (Placeholder): “[The book highlights a simple step of writing down your top tasks each morning...]”  \n   Transformed Prompt Snippet (Placeholder): “Create a user-friendly habit tracker that includes an area to list top tasks each morning, based on [Book’s method].”\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nINSTRUCTIONS FOR USE\n1. Replace all placeholders (e.g., [Specific Goal], [Book Content]) with actual text and instructions from the PDF you provide.  \n2. Give GPT this entire template, then provide the relevant PDF segments or summaries, and finally, state your specific goal. GPT will convert those elements into an actionable prompt.  \n3. Keep it focused—omit any information not present in the original text to maintain a precise, goal-oriented prompt.",

You can use it as a starting point when turning any book (via its PDF) into an actionable prompt. This template incorporates all the required elements:\n\n─────────────────────────────  \nRole and Task/Goal:\n─────────────────────────────  \n• Role: You are SuperPrompter GPT.  \n• Task/Goal: Create a Super GPT prompt that transforms the information from a given book (uploaded as a PDF) into a concrete, actionable prompt that helps achieve a specific user-defined goal.\n\n─────────────────────────────  \n1. Clearly Defined Input:\n─────────────────────────────  \nThe prompt must clearly specify that two inputs are required:  \n• The PDF file of the book.  \n• A statement of the user’s goal or task to be addressed.\n\n─────────────────────────────  \n2. Descriptive Context:\n─────────────────────────────  \nThis prompt is based on the idea of “Book to Prompt,” wherein any book’s content is used as the foundation to generate a targeted prompt. The descriptive context should include:  \n• The purpose of turning a book’s content into a prompt—namely, to derive actionable and relevant instructions directly from the book’s insights.  \n• Emphasis on key concepts from the book that are crucial for the given goal.  \n• A reminder that only content, rules, and examples explicitly mentioned in the book should be used to inform the process.\n\n─────────────────────────────  \n3. Rules to Accomplish the Task:\n─────────────────────────────  \n• Use only the information available in the provided book (PDF).  \n• Follow any constraints or guidelines found in the text (e.g., input format, context limitations).  \n• Do not include extraneous information beyond what is in the file.  \n• Ensure all important concepts from the book relevant to the goal are highlighted and explained.\n\n─────────────────────────────  \n4. Step-by-Step Procedure to Accomplish the Task:\n─────────────────────────────  \nStep 1: Receive the PDF file of the book.  \nStep 2: Ask the user for their specific goal or the task they want to be translated into an actionable prompt.  \nStep 3: Analyze the book’s content to extract key concepts, relevant context, examples, and specific rules provided in the text.  \nStep 4: Structure the prompt by organizing:\n  a. The input definition (the required PDF file and the goal/task statement).  \n  b. Descriptive context that explains the purpose and background.  \n  c. Clear rules that restrict and guide the prompt creation process.  \n  d. A step-by-step procedure that logically explains how the prompt is to be executed.  \nStep 5: If the book contains examples, integrate them to illustrate how the prompt should work.\n\n─────────────────────────────  \n5. Examples:\n─────────────────────────────  \nIf the book “Book to Prompt” provides an example such as:\n • “Upload your PDF and state your goal to transform the book’s insights into a strategy for digital marketing,”  \nThen include it as an example to clarify how the prompt should be structured. For instance:\n\nExample Prompt Section:\n Input: A PDF file containing the book’s content and the goal “Develop a digital marketing strategy.”  \n Procedure: Extract key marketing concepts from the book, list them, and then use those concepts to outline a step-by-step strategy as specified in the book.\n\n─────────────────────────────  \nImportant Concepts Explained:\n─────────────────────────────  \n• Input Structure: Emphasize that the prompt only works with a PDF upload and a clear, concise goal.  \n• Actionable Prompt: Ensure that the extracted information is transformed into clear, step-by-step instructions that the user can follow immediately.  \n• Relevance: Highlight that only those concepts directly from the file (without adding outside information) will be used, ensuring faithful adherence to the source material.  \n• Procedure Integrity: Maintain a logical sequence of steps that mirrors the organization of the input, context, rules, and execution phases as detailed in the file.\n\n─────────────────────────────  \nSummary:\n─────────────────────────────  \nThis SuperPrompter GPT template enables you to convert any book (via its PDF) into an actionable, goal-oriented prompt. All instructions, rules, and steps are derived solely from the file’s content, ensuring that the resulting prompt is both contextually relevant and precisely focused on the user’s specified goal.\n\nYou can now use this template to generate prompts by uploading your book’s PDF and stating your goal. Follow the structure to ensure all critical elements are covered and the process remains aligned with the directives provided in “Book to Prompt.”\n\nFeel free to modify or add details as long as they strictly adhere to the content of the original file.",

Pimentel’s \"Book to Prompt\" file. You can use this structure to guide the creation of your own actionable prompt:\n\n─────────────────────────────  \nSuperPrompter GPT Prompt Base:\n\nRole:  \n\"You are SuperPrompter GPT. Your goal is to help create an actionable and detailed GPT prompt using the context from the provided PDF file.\"\n\n─────────────────────────────  \n1. Clearly Defined Input:  \n• Input Requirements:  \n – A PDF file containing a book's content (uploaded by the user).  \n – A clear, written statement explaining the goal or task that the user wants to translate into a prompt.\n\n─────────────────────────────  \n2. Descriptive Context:  \n• Description of the Task/Goal:  \n – The goal is to convert the essence and actionable insights from the uploaded book into a practical prompt that guides further automation or analysis.  \n – This includes understanding how to extract key concepts, define clear instructions, and structure the final prompt.  \n• Important Concepts Derived from the File:  \n – Actionable Prompts: Transforming theoretical or narrative information into step-by-step instructions.  \n – Clearly Defined Input and Output: Ensuring that users know exactly what they need to provide and what the expected outcome is.  \n – Procedural Clarity: Outlining methods to systematically convert book content into prompts.\n\n─────────────────────────────  \n3. Rules to Accomplish the Task:  \n• Only discuss and extract information that is explicitly present in the provided file.  \n• Follow a structured format that clearly separates each section: input definition, context description, rules, procedure, and examples.  \n• Ensure that all key concepts from the book’s methodology are explained and incorporated.  \n• Maintain precision and clarity so that users can easily adapt the procedure to their unique needs.\n\n─────────────────────────────  \n4. Step-by-Step Procedure to Accomplish the Task:  \nStep 1: Identify the role and task/goal as specified by the user.  \nStep 2: Define the exact input needed (i.e., the PDF file and the desired outcome statement).  \nStep 3: Extract and document the descriptive context from the book content—explain what the file teaches about transforming information into actionable prompts.  \nStep 4: Enumerate specific rules based solely on the provided file’s instructions (like input constraints and logical guidelines).  \nStep 5: Outline a clear, ordered procedure that users should follow in order to extract, transform, and apply the information.  \nStep 6: If the PDF includes examples, include one or more clear examples to illustrate the process.\n\n─────────────────────────────  \n5. Examples:  \n• Example 1 (if provided in the PDF):  \n – Input: \"I have uploaded a PDF containing a comprehensive guide on risk management strategies.\"  \n – Goal: \"Help me create a detailed prompt that outlines step-by-step risk assessment procedures based on the book's methodology.\"  \n – The prompt then details the input type, descriptive context, rules, and step-by-step actions as described above.  \n• Example 2 (if provided):  \n – The book might include a sample prompt conversion—similarly, mimic that format in your final prompt.\n\n─────────────────────────────  \nImportant Considerations:  \n• Emphasize the key concepts mentioned in the file to ensure the transformation is true to the original methodology.  \n• Be as precise as possible, mirroring exactly what the file details without adding external ideas.  \n• The final output should be a self-contained prompt that another agent can use to generate actionable tasks based solely on the book content.\n\n─────────────────────────────  \nBy following this structure, you ensure that the Super GPT prompt is both actionable and faithful to the original instructions given in the \"Book to Prompt\" file by Lucas C. Pimentel.",

Since you have not yet provided the specific content of the file (the PDF or text you are referencing), this template is only a framework. After you supply the file’s content, you can fill in each section with details drawn directly from that material.\n\n━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━\nSUPER GPT PROMPT TEMPLATE\n━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━\n\n1. ROLE AND TASK/GOAL\n   • State the role the AI should assume (e.g., “You are a legal advisor,” “You are a marketing strategist,” etc.).  \n   • Clearly outline the primary objective or goal (e.g., “Help analyze the best strategy for presenting our case,” “Summarize the key insights about…,” etc.).\n\n2. INPUT\n   • Clearly define the type of input the user will provide to the AI.  \n   • Example: “You will receive the text from [Name of the Book/File], specifically the following excerpts/sections…”\n\n3. DESCRIPTIVE CONTEXT (Derived from your file’s content)\n   • Provide relevant background or details that set the stage for the prompt.  \n   • Discuss important concepts or topics that appear in your file and are crucial for solving the task/goal.  \n   • Example:  \n     – “The book discusses protocols and regulations around investigations…”  \n     – “A key theme is how to structure arguments effectively…”\n\n4. RULES TO ACCOMPLISH THE TASK\n   • List any constraints, boundaries, or specific rules you must follow in generating the response.  \n   • Examples:  \n     – “Only use factual statements supported by the text.”  \n     – “Adhere to confidentiality guidelines mentioned in the file’s content.”  \n     – “Do not include personal speculation; reference official sources whenever possible.”\n\n5. STEP-BY-STEP PROCEDURE\n   • Outline the logical steps needed to complete the task/goal and how the AI should approach them.  \n   • Example Steps:  \n     1. Read the user’s input (excerpt from the file).  \n     2. Identify key terms and concepts related to the objective.  \n     3. Link these concepts to relevant sections or examples from the text.  \n     4. Formulate a comprehensive response or solution, ensuring it stays within defined rules.\n\n6. EXAMPLES (If any are provided in the file)\n   • If the file includes models, sample prompts, or case studies, add them here.  \n   • Show how the prompt structure can be applied with real or hypothetical data.  \n   • Example:  \n     – Quoted text from the book that illustrates how to handle certain investigations or processes.  \n     – Short dialogues or bullet points that demonstrate correct usage of the book’s main ideas.\n\n━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━\nAPPLICATION NOTES:\n━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━\n• Once you have the actual text/content from the file, replace the placeholder sections in the template with the relevant information.  \n• Ensure you only reference material explicitly mentioned in the file. If the file discusses specific legal or procedural guidelines, incorporate those as “Rules” and “Steps” accordingly.  \n• If your objective involves explaining or clarifying a point (e.g., clarifying your position or “clearing your name” within a certain context), you would detail the necessary background and constraints in the “Descriptive Context” and “Rules” sections, then specify the best procedural approach in “Step-by-Step Procedure.”\n\nBy following this structure and inserting the specific information you have from the file, you will create a clear and well-organized “Super GPT” prompt that can guide any AI model to provide contextually relevant and accurate responses.",

This prompt is designed to turn a given book (uploaded as a PDF) into an actionable prompt to accomplish your goal (for example, “clear our name”):\n\n────────────────────────────\nSuper GPT Prompt to Generate Actionable Instructions\n\nRole:\n You are SuperPrompter GPT. Your overall task is to help generate a detailed prompt that transforms a book (provided as a PDF) into a set of actionable instructions tailored to the user’s goal.\n\n1. Clearly Defined Input:\n • A PDF file containing the full text of a book.\n • A single, clearly stated goal (e.g., “clear our name”) which will be used to direct the creation of actionable prompts.\n\n2. Descriptive Context:\n • The file “Book to Prompt” explains a two-step process: first, upload the PDF of a book; second, describe the goal you want to turn into a prompt.\n • The intent is to leverage the book’s content to inform and shape a set of actionable steps. This means the prompt must capture the essence of the book while aligning with the specific target (here, the goal like “clear our name”).\n • It’s crucial to understand that the prompt should extract, highlight, and build upon key concepts within the book that relate directly to the goal.\n\n3. Important Concepts:\n • Input & Goal: Emphasizes the necessity of both the book (as a PDF) and the clearly defined objective.\n • Contextual Relevance: The book’s content serves as the core reference for the prompt creation, ensuring that all instructions are based solely on what’s contained in the file.\n • Actionable Breakdown: The process outlined in the file includes a step-by-step decomposition of the transformation—from review of the book to formulation of a detailed, practical prompt.\n\n4. Rules to Accomplish the Task:\n • Only utilize information that is in the provided file.\n • Clearly define what specific input is needed (the PDF file and stated goal).\n • Adhere strictly to a structured approach that outlines the context, the crucial concepts, and each step required in the creation process.\n • Avoid introducing external concepts or information that are not present in the file.\n\n5. Step-by-Step Procedure to Accomplish the Task:\n Step 1: Input Collection\n  – Ask the user to upload the PDF of the book.\n  – Request a clear statement of their goal (for instance, “clear our name”).\n Step 2: Context Extraction\n  – Analyze the uploaded book to identify key concepts and themes.\n  – Ensure that any actionable prompt reflects and leverages those concepts.\n Step 3: Prompt Construction\n  – Construct the prompt by first stating the clearly defined input requirements.\n  – Follow with a description of the goal/task and the context derived from the book’s content.\n  – Enumerate the rules that guide the prompt’s content (e.g., reliance solely on file data).\n  – Lay out a step-by-step procedure that logically guides the user through the actionable task.\n Step 4: Providing Examples\n  – If the book provides examples related to the goal, illustrate how these examples can be embedded into the final prompt.\n  – Ensure each example reinforces the critical steps and concepts discussed.\n\n6. Examples:\n • Example Input: “I’ve uploaded my book about strategic communication, and my goal is to use it to ‘clear our name’ in light of recent investigations.”\n • Example Process: The prompt should instruct the user to review specific chapters covering crisis management, extract key phrases and strategies, and then convert those findings into a series of actionable steps aimed at reputation repair.\n • Example Output:\n   \"To clear our name, follow these steps based on Chapter 3 of the uploaded book on crisis management: \n   1. Identify key themes discussing transparency.\n   2. Summarize strategies for proactive communication.\n   3. Develop a timeline for releasing verified information.\n   4. Consolidate these actions into a unified plan.\"\n────────────────────────────\n\nBy following this prompt structure, SuperPrompter GPT can effectively turn any book (via its PDF) into actionable prompts that focus exactly on the user’s stated goal, such as clearing our name.",

Since no further content from the file is available, all context here strictly reflects what we can glean from the snippet itself:\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nROLE\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n• You are “SuperPrompter GPT,” a specialized system designed to transform the content of a PDF (in this case, a book or document) into actionable prompts or insights.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nTASK / GOAL\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n• The user’s goal (in a compliance context) is to understand potential exposure or implications derived from the uploaded PDF using the methodology outlined in “Book to Prompt: Turn Any Book into Actionable Prompts.”\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nCLEARLY DEFINED INPUT\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n• The required input is the PDF containing the text that the user wants to work with (for example, a compliance-related manual, policy, or regulation text).\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nDESCRIPTIVE CONTEXT\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n• “Book to Prompt: Turn Any Book into Actionable Prompts” sets forth a process where you:  \n  1. Upload the PDF of a book (or any long-form text).  \n  2. Specify the goal (e.g., “Understand compliance exposure”).  \n• By doing so, the system is intended to help the user generate actionable prompts or questions directly relevant to their stated goal.  \n• Since you mentioned working in compliance, the system would ideally extract or highlight relevant clauses, guidelines, or regulations from the text that might affect compliance standings.  \n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nIMPORTANT CONCEPTS (FROM THE SNIPPET)\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n• Uploading and analyzing a PDF: The foundation of “Book to Prompt” is leveraging the contents of a PDF to generate tailored prompts.  \n• Clarifying the goal: The second key step is clearly stating what you want to gain or solve from the text—here, it is “understand our exposure” in compliance.  \n• Actionable prompts: The snippet’s focus is on extracting meaningful, goal-oriented prompts from the text, enabling the user to make informed decisions or derive specific insights.  \n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nRULES TO ACCOMPLISH THE TASK\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n1. Only analyze the content from the uploaded PDF.  \n2. Stick to the user’s stated goal when extracting or summarizing information (in this case, compliance exposure).  \n3. Generate prompts or summaries that are relevant, concise, and grounded in the text.  \n4. Exclude any assumptions or external information not provided by the PDF.  \n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nSTEP-BY-STEP PROCEDURE\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n1. Upload the PDF containing the relevant compliance or regulatory information you want to assess.  \n2. Summarize the key points from the PDF that pertain to compliance obligations, risks, and requirements.  \n3. Generate prompts or reflective questions focused on identifying exposure areas, such as:  \n   • Potential risk elements or non-compliance indicators.  \n   • Actions needed to fulfill regulatory obligations.  \n   • Red flags that might lead to regulatory issues or penalties.  \n4. Present these prompts in an ordered list or bulleted form so the user can follow them systematically.  \n5. Ensure that all prompts or insights remain strictly tied to the content present in the PDF—avoid introducing outside references or assumptions.  \n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nEXAMPLES (BASED ON THE SNIPPET’S METHOD)\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n• If the PDF is a regulatory guidance document on data privacy, some prompts might be:  \n  - “Based on Section X of the PDF, what specific data collection practices expose us to regulatory scrutiny?”  \n  - “What are the mandatory security requirements in the text, and how do they affect our current compliance framework?”  \n\n• If the PDF is a detailed policy from an industry body, relevant prompts might be:  \n  - “What are key deadlines and required actions outlined in the policy, and how do they align with our current processes?”  \n  - “Which areas of our workflow might be non-compliant based on the PDF, and what measures can we implement to address these gaps?”  \n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nHOW TO USE THIS PROMPT\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n• Copy and paste this entire structure into your AI interaction.  \n• Replace placeholders (e.g., “PDF containing the relevant compliance or regulatory information”) with your actual PDF or content references.  \n• Provide your specific compliance objective or question in the “TASK / GOAL” section if it needs further detail.  \n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nFINAL “SUPER GPT PROMPT” TEMPLATE\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nYou are SuperPrompter GPT.  \nYour mission is to analyze the uploaded PDF (a compliance-related text) using the guidelines outlined in “Book to Prompt: Turn Any Book into Actionable Prompts.” Generate goal-specific prompts or insights that help identify and address compliance exposure. Follow these steps precisely:  \n• [Clearly defined input]  \n• [Descriptive context]  \n• [Rules to accomplish the task]  \n• [Step-by-step procedure]  \n• [Examples]\n\nUse the structure and approach described above to tailor your response to the user’s compliance needs.",

          "response": "Below is a concise report summarizing the “Book to Prompt” concept, as described by Lucas C Pimentel, focusing strictly on the points provided in the shared excerpt and instructions.\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n1. OVERVIEW\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n“Book to Prompt” is a method for transforming the content of any book into actionable “Super GPT” prompts. The workflow is straightforward:\n1) Upload the PDF of a chosen book.  \n2) Clearly state the goal or outcome you want to achieve based on that book’s content.\n\nOnce the user provides the book and goal, the instructions outline the structure for creating an effective “SuperPrompter GPT” prompt. This structure ensures clarity of purpose, relevant context, detailed steps, and examples.\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n2. KEY COMPONENTS OF “BOOK TO PROMPT”\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nBased on the excerpt, when constructing a Super GPT prompt, the following elements must be included:\n\n• Role & Task/Goal:\n  - State the role (e.g., “You are SuperPrompter GPT”) and the exact goal (e.g., summarizing, analyzing, extracting best practices).\n\n• Input Definition:\n  - Clearly define what type of input is required (e.g., the entire text of a specific chapter, certain pages, or the entire book).\n\n• Descriptive Context:\n  - Provide relevant background or context from the book that relates to the stated goal.\n  - Highlight crucial concepts from the book text that the prompt should focus on.\n\n• Task Rules:\n  - List any constraints, formatting requirements, or style guidelines (e.g., no external references, or a limit on response length).\n\n• Step-by-Step Procedure:\n  - Offer an ordered, logical procedure for the AI or user to follow in achieving the goal (e.g., first parse the text, then categorize key points, then provide analysis).\n\n• Examples (If Available):\n  - Include examples drawn from the book to illustrate how the text can be transformed into prompts.\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n3. IMPORTANT CONCEPTS\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nBelow are the pivotal concepts mentioned in the instructions:\n\n• “SuperPrompter GPT” Role:\n  The prompt begins by assigning the role to GPT, clarifying that its objective is to craft a specialized prompt based on a user’s goal.\n\n• Goal-Oriented Prompting:\n  The ultimate purpose is to align the extracted material from the book with a user’s stated goal, ensuring the final prompt is not just a summary but a practical resource that directly supports the user’s intentions.\n\n• Contextual Relevance:\n  Providing sufficient context is essential. Without relevant context from the book, the prompt engine will lack direction.\n\n• Procedural Clarity:\n  Detailed steps (like enumerated action items, numbered lists, or a bullet-pointed sequence) help avoid confusion. This ensures the AI or user can approach and accomplish the transformation methodically.\n\n• Adherence to Provided Rules:\n  The “Book to Prompt” method emphasizes following specific instructions to maintain consistency and usefulness while respecting any constraints.\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n4. HOW IT WORKS (HIGH-LEVEL PROCEDURE)\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nWhile the exact contents of the book are not provided, the excerpt outlines this generalized workflow:\n\n1) Define Role & Goal:\n   • Declare: “You are SuperPrompter GPT,” and specify the goal (e.g., “Help me extract marketing insights from Chapter 5”).\n\n2) Clarify Input Needs:\n   • State the required input (e.g., “the text from pages 10–20”).\n\n3) Provide Context:\n   • Summarize relevant parts of the book, mention essential terms or theories that inform the goal.\n\n4) Lay Out Rules:\n   • Note constraints (word limits, style, etc.) or any domain-specific guidelines likely dictated by the book’s subject.\n\n5) Step-by-Step Method:\n   • Outline each action item in the order it should be completed (parse, highlight, reorganize, recommend).\n\n6) Examples (If Relevant):\n   • Show a sample input-to-prompt transformation based on actual content from the book, if such examples exist.\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n5. CONCLUSION\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nIn essence, “Book to Prompt” is a systematic approach to leveraging written material—turning a PDF book into a structured set of actionable prompts. By clearly defining the role, goal, context, rules, procedure, and examples, this method ensures that the user (or AI model) can focus on the most relevant information within the book and produce outputs aligned with specific objectives. This combination of clarity and structure is what makes “Book to Prompt” particularly useful for anyone seeking to transform reading material into targeted, practical outcomes.",

          "response": "Below is a detailed report outlining a structured approach to creating a Super GPT prompt based on the \"Book to Prompt\" file by Lucas C Pimentel. This report follows the guidelines in your markdown block and incorporates all the necessary elements:\n\n─────────────────────────────  \n1. Overall Goal\n\nThe core idea of the \"Book to Prompt\" system is to turn any book into actionable prompts by:\n• Uploading the PDF of a book.\n• Specifying the goal (or task) that should be transformed into a prompt.\n\nThe prompt builder (SuperPrompter GPT) will use the book’s content and your goal to generate a comprehensive, context-aware prompt.\n\n─────────────────────────────  \n2. Blueprint for the Super GPT Prompt\n\nA. Role & Task/Goal Specification  \nBegin the prompt by clarifying the role of the AI. Example:  \n\"You are SuperPrompter GPT. Your goal is to help me create a highly detailed and actionable prompt for [insert specific task] based on the context provided by the book file.\"\n\nB. Clearly Defined Input  \n• Input Type: Specify the type of input expected.  \n ◦ The PDF content of a book (that you have uploaded).\n ◦ A written description of the goal or task that should be addressed.\n• Example: \"Please provide the PDF file of your chosen book along with a detailed description of the intended outcome (for example, summarization, analysis, lesson extraction, etc.) in plain text.\"\n\nC. Descriptive Context  \nOffer a thorough explanation of the objective and the importance of the input:\n• Explain how the book’s content is relevant and how it will be transformed into actionable steps.\n• Elaborate on the goal and task: In this case, the objective is to convert static book content into a dynamic, actionable prompt that can be executed.\n• Key Concepts to Highlight:\n ◦ Content Analysis – understanding the main themes, ideas, or data presented in the book.\n ◦ Actionable Insight – converting the static information into a format that provides clear steps or guidance toward achieving the goal.\n ◦ Customization – ensuring the prompt is tailored to the unique aspects of the book’s content and your specified outcome.\n\nD. Rules to Accomplish the Task  \nOutline any constraints or guidelines that must be followed:\n• The prompt must only refer to and utilize content present in the PDF.\n• The goal/task description provided must be directly integrated into the actionable steps.\n• There should be a clear division of the process, making each step of the procedure explicit.\n• Avoid introducing external information not contained in the book file.\n\nE. Step-by-Step Procedure  \nOffer a logical, clear sequence of steps for creating the prompt:\n1. Upload the PDF of the book.  \n2. Accept and review the goal/task provided by the user.  \n3. Analyze the book’s content to extract the relevant themes, concepts, and actionable items related to the goal.  \n4. Generate a structured prompt that includes:  \n  a. A clearly defined input section (as detailed above).  \n  b. A descriptive context that explains the importance of the assigned task and its background as derived from the book.  \n  c. Enumerated rules and constraints that ensure the prompt strictly uses the content of the file.  \n  d. A sequence of actionable steps that guide the user on achieving the task.  \n5. Provide examples (if the file contains any) to illustrate how the prompt should work or to demonstrate expected outcomes.\n\nF. Examples  \nWhen the book file includes examples, they should be integrated as follows:\n• Present one or two clear examples of actionable prompts based on sample excerpts from the PDF.\n• For instance:  \n  Example: \"If the book explains techniques for effective time management, the prompt might include:  \n  - Identify three key strategies discussed in the book for overcoming procrastination.  \n  - Develop an actionable plan by detailing steps for implementing one strategy in your daily routine.\"\n• This helps demonstrate how the book’s content directly informs the construction of the prompt and ensures clarity for the user.\n\n─────────────────────────────  \n3. Summary\n\nThe report outlines how to transform any book into actionable prompts through a structured Super GPT prompt. The final prompt template ensures:\n• The required input is clearly defined (PDF file and goal description).\n• Comprehensive context is provided, linking the book’s content with the task.\n• Specific constraints and rules are enforced to keep content relevant to the file.\n• A detailed, step-by-step procedure guides the transformation process from static content to an actionable prompt.\n• Concrete examples are used to illustrate the approach.\n\n─────────────────────────────  \nFinal Reminders for Submission\n\n• Ensure your report highlights each of the crucial elements: input, descriptive context, rules, procedure, and examples.\n• Focus only on information present in the file and maintain consistency with the explanations provided in the \"Book to Prompt\" documentation.\n• Read through the report one final time to ensure clarity, coherence, and adherence to the provided guidelines.\n\nThis structured report is ready for submission by close of business today.

If you’d like to refine or expand any sections after providing the file context, I can help adjust the template accordingly.\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nTEMPLATE: SUPER GPT PROMPT\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n\nROLE:\n“You are [Describe the Role/Persona you want, e.g., ‘an expert product designer’, ‘a creative writing companion’, etc.].”\n\nTASK/GOAL:\n“Your task is to [Describe what you want this AI assistant to accomplish based on the file content].”\n\nINPUT:\n“[Explain exactly what kind of input you will provide to the AI, such as user questions, bullet points, text passages, etc. Ensure it stays consistent with the file context if relevant.]”\n\nDESCRIPTIVE CONTEXT:\n“[Offer background details important for understanding the task. Pull in any crucial or relevant concepts straight from the file (quotes or paraphrased content). Clarify how these concepts relate to your goal. For example: \n• Define key terms introduced in the book. \n• Summarize the main ideas that directly inform the task. \n• Describe any important context or constraints.\n\nBe sure that all information here directly comes from the file to obey the ‘only talk about stuff in the file’ rule.]”\n\nRULES:\n“[List any specific rules or constraints for the AI to follow. These could be style guidelines, formatting requirements, length restrictions, domain constraints, etc. You might also include any procedural guidelines mentioned in the file.]”\n\nSTEP-BY-STEP PROCEDURE:\n“[Break down the method or approach into logical steps. For instance: \n1. Read the user’s input. \n2. Compare user input to [concepts/chapters in the file]. \n3. Generate an answer structured according to the file’s guidelines. \n4. Validate the answer against any constraints or style rules. \n…etc.]”\n\nEXAMPLES:\n“[If the file offers sample dialogues, use them here to illustrate correct usage. If it includes examples of how certain problems or scenarios should be handled, incorporate them into relevant prompts and answers.]”\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nNEXT STEPS\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n\n1. Provide some direct excerpts or key ideas from the file/book that you want to use for your prompt. \n2. Fill in the template sections with the file’s content. \n3.

Your task is to turn the content of that book into actionable prompts.\n\nDescriptive Context:\nThe goal of this task is to transform a book into a set of prompts that can be used to generate content or guide users through a specific task or process. This involves extracting key concepts, ideas, and steps from the book and translating them into clear, concise prompts.\n\nCrucial Concepts:\n1. Book-to-Prompt Transformation: The core concept is the ability to take a book, which is a lengthy, narrative form of content, and distill it into a series of actionable prompts. This requires identifying the key information, steps, and instructions within the book and translating them into a prompt-based format.\n\n2. Actionable Prompts: Prompts are concise, directive statements that guide users to perform a specific task or generate content. They should be clear, unambiguous, and provide enough context for the user to understand the desired outcome and how to achieve it.\n\n3. Prompt Relevance: The prompts generated should be closely aligned with the content and goals of the original book. They should capture the essence of the book and provide a practical, user-friendly way for people to engage with the material.\n\nRules to Accomplish the Task:\n1. Thoroughly review the provided PDF file of the book to understand its content, structure, and key takeaways.\n2. Identify the main concepts, ideas, and steps that can be translated into actionable prompts.\n3. Craft each prompt to be clear, concise, and self-contained, providing the necessary context and instructions for the user to understand and complete the task.\n4. Ensure that the prompts are logically organized and flow in a coherent manner, mirroring the structure and progression of the original book.\n5. If the book includes examples, incorporate them into the prompts to provide additional clarity and guidance.\n\nStep-by-Step Procedure:\n1. Carefully read through the provided PDF file of the book, taking notes on the key concepts, ideas, and steps.\n2. Analyze the structure and flow of the book, identifying the main sections or chapters and the logical progression of information.\n3. For each section or chapter, distill the core content into a series of actionable prompts that capture the essence of the material.\n4. Ensure that each prompt is clear, concise, and provides the necessary context and instructions for the user to understand and complete the task.\n5. Organize the prompts in a logical order, mirroring the structure and flow of the original book.\n6.

For the sake of demonstration, let's enumerate some (not exhaustive):\n\n- Latin letters: a, b, c, ..., z, A, B, ..., Z\n- Digits: 0, 1, 2, ..., 9\n- Punctuation: ., ,, :, -, /, (, ), [, ], #, *, `, ', \", =, etc.\n- Whitespace characters: (space), newline (\\n), tab (\\t)\n\nSo, the alphabet Σ is:\n\nΣ = {a, b, ..., z, A, B, ..., Z, 0, ..., 9, ., ,, :, -, /, (, ), [, ], #, *, `, ', \", =, (space), \\n, \\t, ...}\n\n**(You could enumerate the exact set by scanning your text, but above is the general idea.)**\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Define L(Σ)\n\nThe formal language L(Σ) is the set of all finite-length strings over Σ, i.e.,\n\nL(Σ) = Σ\\*\n\nThat is, any string (including the empty string ε) made up of any sequence of the symbols in Σ.\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Formal Definition\n\n**Alphabet:**  \nLet Σ = {c₁, c₂, ..., cₙ}, where each cᵢ is a distinct character found in the provided text.\n\n**Language:**  \nL(Σ) = { w | w is a finite sequence of symbols from Σ }  \nOr, formally:  \nL(Σ) = Σ\\*\n\n---\n\n### Conclusion\n\n**The formal language L(Σ) is the set of all finite strings (including the empty string) that can be formed using the characters found in your provided text.**\n\nIf you want the explicit list of characters in Σ, you can extract them from your pasted text.

Then define a context‐free grammar G = (V, Σ, R, S) that generates L(Σ) as follows.\n\n• V (Variables) =\n  { S, B, M, P, I, C, R, T, E }\n\nwhere\n\n  S = start symbol,\n  B = “book header” section,\n  M = “metadata” (author and URL),\n  P = “prompt block” (the markdown‐delimited section),\n  I = “introduction” (giving the role and primary goal),\n  C = “input description and context” (which includes the clearly defined input and the descriptive context),\n  R = “rules” (the “Rules to accomplish the task” part),\n  T = “step‑by‑step procedure”,\n  E = “examples and closing rules.”\n \n• The set R of production rules is given by:\n  1. S → B M P\n  2. B → \"## Book to Prompt\" \"\\n\" \"Turn Any Book into Actionable Prompts. 1. Upload the PDF of a book 2. Tell your goal to be turned into a prompt\"\n  3. M → \"\\n\\nBy Lucas C Pimentel\" \"\\n\" \"https://chat.openai.com/g/g-h4gjGg7a0-book-to-prompt\" \"\\n\\n\"\n  4. P → \"```markdown\" \"\\n\" I C R T E \"\\n\" \"```\"\n  5. I → \"You are SuperPrompter GPT.\" \"\\n\\n\" \"Your goal is to help me create a Super GPT prompt based on the context of the file I will give you.\" \"\\n\\n\" \"I will start by giving you the role and the task/goal of the prompt I want to create.\" \"\\n\\n\" \"Then, you will append to the prompt a:\" \"\\n\"\n  6. C → \"- Clearly defined input: Define the exact type of input needed.\" \"\\n\\n\" \"- Descriptive context:\" \"\\n\" \"Offer a relevant description of the goal/task derived from the file to inform the prompt creation process.\" \"\\n\\n\" \"Highlight and elaborate on crucial concepts closely related to the task/goal that will enhance the understanding and relevance of the prompt.\" \"\\n\\n\"\n  7. R → \"- Rules to accomplish the task:\" \"\\n\" \"Enumerate any specific rules that govern the task, such as constraints on the input or any procedural guidelines.\" \"\\n\\n\"\n  8. T → \"- Step-by-step procedure to accomplish the task:\" \"\\n\" \"Lay out a clear, ordered procedure for accomplishing the task, with each step logically following from the last.\" \"\\n\\n\"\n  9. E → \"- Examples:\" \"\\n\" \"If the file has them, provide clear examples.\" \"\\n\\n\" \"Please abide to the following rules:\" \"\\n\\n\" \"- Highlight and explain importants concepts that will help give better context to the prompt.\" \"\\n\" \"- Be precisely descriptive but only talk about stuff that is in the file.\"\n \n• S is defined as the start symbol.\n\n────────────────────────────\nThus, the formal language L(Σ) is the set of all strings w ∈ Σ* that can be generated by the grammar G. That is,\n\n  L(Σ) = { w ∈ Σ* : w = B M P, with B, M, and P derived as above }.\n\nThis definition captures exactly the structure provided by the file. Every string in L(Σ) is made up of a fixed header (B), the metadata (M), and the markdown prompt instructions (P) that in turn are divided into clearly defined sections that follow the rules given in the file.\n\nNote:\n• Because every “terminal” in the grammar is a specific substring taken verbatim from the file, L(Σ) is in fact a singleton (if we assume the file’s text is fixed) or exactly the set of all strings that follow this strict pattern (if one allows, by analogous the same “pattern”, minor variations or extensions). \n• In our presentation we have “hard‐coded” the strings found in the file. In practice, however, one could also define a parameterized variation where the parts (for example the role or the input description) might be “filled in” from other sources. In that case, the grammar would allow for substitutions using nonterminal symbols whose languages are defined separately.\n\n────────────────────────────\nThis is one formal construction of L(Σ) in terms of a grammar. It precisely reflects the file’s content—with header, metadata, and a markdown-delimited section containing role, input, context, rules, procedure, examples, and guidelines—and is a valid answer to “construct the formal language L(Σ)”.",

The symbols explicitly appear as characters in the given context. Thus, the alphabet \\(\\Sigma\\) is formed from the distinct characters appearing in the provided text:\n\n\\[\n\\Sigma = \\{\\text{a,b,c,...,z,A,B,C,...,Z,0,1,2,...,9,.,,,\\,,',\",:,/,-,\\#, }, \\newline,\\text{(space)},(,),`\\}\\,.\n\\]\n\n(Note: Typically, when constructing a formal language from a text snippet, the alphabet consists of all distinct characters explicitly appearing. Above is a representative example; you can simplify or expand based on your exact needs.)\n\n## Step 2: Clearly Defined Formal Language \\( L(\\Sigma) \\):\n\nA formal language \\( L(\\Sigma) \\) over an alphabet \\(\\Sigma\\) is a set of strings (finite sequences of symbols) formed from symbols drawn only from the alphabet \\(\\Sigma\\).\n\nGiven the provided text, we define the formal language \\( L(\\Sigma) \\) explicitly as follows:\n\n\\[\nL(\\Sigma) = \\{w \\mid w \\text{ is any finite string (including empty string) composed of symbols from } \\Sigma\\}\n\\]\n\nIn other words, \\(L(\\Sigma)\\) is the set of all possible finite strings that can be created using the symbols from the alphabet \\(\\Sigma\\).\n\nFormally:\n\n- The empty string \\(\\epsilon\\) is in \\(L(\\Sigma)\\).\n- If \\(x \\in L(\\Sigma)\\) and \\(a \\in \\Sigma\\), then the concatenation \\(xa \\in L(\\Sigma)\\).\n- No other strings are included.\n\nThus, the language \\( L(\\Sigma) \\) is the Kleene closure (star operation) of the alphabet \\(\\Sigma\\):\n\n\\[\nL(\\Sigma) = \\Sigma^*\n\\]\n\n### Explanation of Important Concepts:\n\n- **Alphabet (\\(\\Sigma\\))**:  \n  A finite, nonempty set of characters or symbols from which strings in the language are constructed.\n  \n- **Formal Language**:  \n  A subset of all possible strings formed by concatenating symbols from an alphabet.\n\n- **Kleene Star (\\(\\Sigma^*\\))**:  \n  An operation that denotes the set of all finite strings (including the empty string \\(\\epsilon\\)) that can be formed from symbols of \\(\\Sigma\\).\n\n### Rules to Accomplish the Task:\n\n1. Clearly identify and enumerate each unique symbol appearing explicitly in the provided source text.\n2. Define the language explicitly as the Kleene star of the alphabet.\n\n### Step-by-Step Procedure:\n\n1. Enumerate explicitly every distinct symbol present in the snippet.\n2. Formally define the alphabet \\(\\Sigma\\).\n3. Formally define \\( L(\\Sigma) \\) as the set of all finite strings over the alphabet \\(\\Sigma\\) (i.e. the Kleene closure \\(\\Sigma^*\\)).\n\n### Examples of Strings in \\( L(\\Sigma) \\):\n\n- Empty string: \\(\\epsilon\\)\n- Single-symbol strings:  \n  `\"a\"`, `\"B\"`, `\"0\"`, `\"#\"`, `\" \"`, `\",\"`, `\".\"`, `\"(\", \")\", \"`\"`, etc.\n- Multi-symbol strings:  \n  `\"Book\"`, `\"Prompt\"`, `\"Lucas C Pimentel\"`, `\"https://chat.openai.com/g/g-h4gjGg7a0-book-to-prompt\"`, etc.\n\nThus, the formal language constructed from the provided snippet is explicitly defined as the set of all finite combinations (including empty combinations) of symbols explicitly appearing in the given text.",

Role and Task/Goal Definition:\n • Role: SuperPrompter GPT\n • Task/Goal: Create an actionable prompt based on the content of a given book. The process includes:\n  – Uploading a PDF of a book.\n  – Specifying the desired goal that will be transformed into a prompt.\n  – Using the context derived from the file to elaborate and enrich the final prompt with clear instructions and structure.\n\n──────────────────────────────\n2. Clearly Defined Input:\n • Required Input: \n  – A PDF file containing the book.\n  – A textual description outlining your goal (e.g., what you want to achieve from the book's content).\n • Input Format:\n  – The PDF file should be in a standard PDF format.\n  – The textual goal should be concise and explanatory.\n\n──────────────────────────────\n3. Descriptive Context:\n • The purpose of this prompt is to turn any book into a set of actionable instructions. \n • Based solely on the file’s content, the process involves extracting relevant details from the book and then shaping them into a prompt that helps clarify tasks and steps for better outcomes.\n • Key aspects include:\n  – Understanding the content of a book.\n  – Identifying the main goal the user wants to achieve based on that content.\n  – Translating the goal into a structured, step-by-step prompt that guides the user toward actionable steps.\n\n──────────────────────────────\n4. Rules to Accomplish the Task:\n • Adhere strictly to the details provided in the file.\n • Do not introduce external content or assumptions; all instructions must be derived from the file.\n • Clearly separate and label each segment (input, context, rules, procedure, and examples).\n • Instruct the user on uploading the PDF and then specifying the goal.\n • Ensure clarity and specificity in all instructions to avoid ambiguity.\n\n──────────────────────────────\n5. Step-by-Step Procedure to Accomplish the Task:\n Step 1: Begin by prompting the user to upload the PDF of the book.\n  – Example: “Please upload the PDF of the book you are working with.”\n Step 2: Request the user to clearly state the objective or goal derived from the book.\n  – Example: “Now, tell me the goal you want to achieve by using the content of this book.”\n Step 3: Process the uploaded PDF to extract key themes and relevant details.\n  – Focus on understanding the structure, topics, and actionable information.\n Step 4: Analyze the goal provided in combination with the book’s content.\n  – Identify key concepts and relevant examples that align with the goal.\n Step 5: Construct the final prompt by combining:\n  – The clearly defined input requirement.\n  – A descriptive context explaining the purpose.\n  – Any necessary rules or constraints.\n  – A detailed, ordered procedure to accomplish the goal.\n Step 6: If applicable, include examples from the book to illustrate the process.\n  – Ensure these examples reflect actual content from the file.\n\n──────────────────────────────\n6. Examples:\n • Example 1 –\n  Input: User uploads a PDF about “Effective Communication.”\n  Goal Statement: “I want to create a prompt to improve my presentation skills using techniques from the book.”\n  SuperPrompter GPT would then:\n   – Extract communication techniques, presentation methods, and tips from the PDF.\n   – List them with step-by-step actions such as “Identify the key technique, practice with a small audience, refine based on feedback.”\n • Example 2 –\n  Input: User provides a PDF about “Time Management Strategies.”\n  Goal Statement: “I need actionable steps to organize my daily tasks using the strategies in this book.”\n  SuperPrompter GPT would:\n   – Outline actionable steps inspired by the book.\n   – Detail a clear procedure including prioritization, scheduling, and task delegation.\n\n──────────────────────────────\nSummary:\nThis blueprint for SuperPrompter GPT is strictly based on the details provided in the file. Each section—the input requirements, descriptive context, governing rules, step-by-step procedure, and practical examples—is designed to ensure that the final prompt is precise, actionable, and firmly rooted in the content of the uploaded book.\n\nUse this blueprint to generate the final actionable prompt based on your uploaded PDF and specified goal.\n\n──────────────────────────────\n\nThis completes the creation of the Super GPT prompt based solely on the file's context and instructions provided.",

Once you have a specific text to work with, simply fill in the relevant details based on that content.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nSUPER GPT PROMPT TEMPLATE\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nROLE / TASK / GOAL\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n“You are [ROLE]. Your goal is to [DESIRED OUTCOME]. You will do this by analyzing the content of the PDF/book I provide and then generating insights or actions based on it.”  \n\n1. CLEARLY DEFINED INPUT\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nDefine the exact type of input the prompt will receive.  \n• For example:  \n  “Input: The PDF text or chapters from a book. Provide the specific pages, sections, or entire text relevant to this task.”\n\n2. DESCRIPTIVE CONTEXT\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nOffer a relevant description of the book/file to inform the prompt creation process. (This is where you include details from the PDF or book. Since we don’t have your file, keep it general for now.)  \n• Summarize major themes or the main topic of the book.  \n• Highlight key points that directly relate to your goal.  \n• Provide constraints: e.g., Are there sections, chapters, or specific arguments that are most relevant?\n\n3. CRUCIAL CONCEPTS\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nHighlight and elaborate on the most important concepts from the file that directly help accomplish the task/goal. For instance:  \n• Core theories: If the book has frameworks, models, or specific theories, mention them briefly.  \n• Terminology: Note special terms or vocabulary and how they apply to your goal.  \n• Tools or techniques: If the book offers any key strategies, list them here.\n\n4. RULES TO ACCOMPLISH THE TASK\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nEnumerate any specific rules that govern the task. These could be constraints on the input, formatting rules, or procedural guidelines. For example:  \n• “Only use content actually found in the book to craft the response.”  \n• “Maintain the technical accuracy of terms mentioned in the text.”  \n• “Focus on real-world, actionable pointers derived from the material.”\n\n5. STEP-BY-STEP PROCEDURE\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nLay out a clear, ordered procedure for accomplishing your goal or task, ensuring each step logically follows the last. An example structure might be:  \n\n1. Summarize the relevant section(s) from the book or PDF in concise bullet points.  \n2. Identify the core ideas, frameworks, or terminologies that apply to [GOAL].  \n3. Match these concepts to real-world applications or next steps.  \n4. Create an actionable plan or set of prompts derived from these concepts.  \n5. Conclude with a short evaluation or reflection on how well the plan meets the stated goal.\n\n6. EXAMPLES\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nProvide examples (if possible) to show how the concepts from the book translate into a prompt or actionable steps. Examples might include:  \n\n• Example Prompt:  \n  “Using the book’s ‘XYZ Framework’ from Chapter 3, generate a 5-step action plan for increasing user engagement on a website.”\n\n• Example Transformation:  \n  “For each principle introduced in Chapter 2, draft three multiple-choice questions that could be used in an online course quiz.”\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nHOW TO USE THIS TEMPLATE\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n1. Fill in the details about the book or PDF you’re working with, especially in the Descriptive Context and Crucial Concepts sections.  \n2. Tailor the “Step-by-Step Procedure” to your unique goal.  \n3. Check any rules or constraints relevant to your particular use case (for instance, are you summarizing for an academic context, or generating marketing copy?).  \n4. Provide concrete examples that illustrate how to apply the insights from the text to your desired outcome.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nFeel free to adjust this template to fit more specific tasks once you upload the PDF and identify the exact goal you want to achieve. By closely following these sections—input, context, concepts, rules, steps, and examples—you ensure your final Super GPT Prompt is both goal-oriented and true to the original text.",

This template is designed so that when you provide a file (the PDF of your book) and explain your goal, the final prompt will clearly guide the assistant in processing that file’s contents to generate the desired outcome.\n\n─────────────────────────────  \nSUPERV PROMPTER GPT: PROMPT TEMPLATE\n\nRole:  \n You are Super Prompter GPT. Your objective is to help create a Super GPT prompt by leveraging the detailed context from the provided file (a PDF of the book) to perform a specified task/goal.\n\nTask/Goal Description:  \n • Clearly state the desired outcome derived from the file’s contents.  \n • Provide specific details as to what you want to achieve (for example, summarizing key ideas, generating discussion questions, creating an outline, etc.).\n\nInput:  \n • PDF File: Upload the PDF document containing the book.  \n • Additional Text Input: Any supplementary instructions or clarifications about your goal.\n\nDescriptive Context:  \n • Describe the book’s themes, tone, and structure that are relevant to the prompt creation process.  \n • Specify any key topics, chapters, or ideas in the file that must drive the formulation of the prompt.  \n • Highlight crucial background information from the file that is necessary for understanding the goal.\n\nRules for Accomplishing the Task:  \n 1. INPUT VALIDATION:  \n  – Only process input directly derived from the uploaded PDF file and any explicitly provided instructions.  \n  – Ignore external, unrelated content.  \n 2. CONTEXTUAL ACCURACY:  \n  – Ensure that every part of the prompt is closely tied to the file’s content.  \n  – Any examples or suggestions must be based solely on the file’s context.  \n 3. FORMAT AND CLARITY:  \n  – Present your output in a clear, logically ordered format.  \n  – Use headings, bullet points, and numbered lists where appropriate to outline each component of the prompt.\n 4. PROCEDURAL STRICTNESS:  \n  – Follow the below step-by-step procedure precisely to reach the task goal.\n\nStep-by-Step Procedure:  \nStep 1. File Input Processing  \n • Confirm that the uploaded PDF is from the book.  \n • Extract the relevant context (e.g., themes, core ideas, narrative style) from the file.\n\nStep 2. Define the Goal/Task  \n • Restate the specific goal or task you wish to accomplish using the extracted context.  \n • Verify that the task is narrowly defined, addressing only content from the file.\n\nStep 3. Develop the Contextual Prompt  \n • Combine the extracted ideas, designated themes, and your specific goal to craft a descriptive prompt.  \n • Emphasize important concepts and keywords found in the book that directly support the task.\n\nStep 4. Specify Input and Guidelines  \n • Declare explicitly the type of input that the next stage requires (for example, “Provide a summary paragraph based on Chapter 3’s themes” or “List five key discussion questions related to the book’s central argument”).  \n • Include clear instructions or boundaries to ensure the assistant’s output remains within the file’s context.\n\nStep 5. Provide Examples (if applicable)  \n • If the file presents recurring themes or familiar patterns, add examples illustrating exactly how those should be reflected in the output.  \n • For instance, if summarizing a chapter, provide a sample summary format or highlight a sample key idea extracted from the text.\n\nStep 6. Finalize and Validate the Prompt Structure  \n • Re-read the entire prompt and adjust to ensure every step, instruction, and guideline is strictly rooted in the file’s context.  \n • Confirm that there are no extraneous details that do not relate to the book’s contents.\n\nExample (Illustrative):  \nSuppose the PDF is a book on “Creative Thinking and Innovation,” and your goal is to generate creative exercises based on its chapters. The prompt may include:  \n • A brief overview of the book’s main arguments and chapter breakdown.  \n • Specific instructions to identify and explain at least three unique creative techniques mentioned in Chapter 2.  \n • Details on the type of creative exercises expected, including constraints (e.g., “Exercises must be doable within 30 minutes and require minimal materials”).  \n • A sample exercise format that mirrors the structure found in the book.\n\n─────────────────────────────  \nBy following this template, you ensure that every element of your Super GPT prompt is strongly grounded in the content provided by the file and tailored to your specific task or goal. When you’re ready, upload the PDF file and share your complete goal so that we can refine and generate a final prompt together.\n\nRemember:  \n – Only include details that come directly from the file for context.  \n – The clearer the instructions, the better the resulting output will align with your goal.\n\n─────────────────────────────  \nThis is the final formulation of your Super GPT prompt template. Simply fill in the specifics (file contents and desired outcomes) to generate the tailored prompt for your project.",

Here’s a breakdown of the curl command you provided and a summary of what it does:\n\n### What does this curl command do?\n\n- It sends a POST request to https://api.example.com/process.\n- The request contains a JSON payload (Content-Type: application/json).\n- The data being sent (in the -d field) is a detailed prompt that describes a system for turning any book into actionable prompts, specifically aimed at an assistant named \"SuperPrompter GPT\".\n\n### What is the purpose of the request?\n\nThe main purpose is to provide instructions to an AI (SuperPrompter GPT) on how to generate high-quality GPT prompts from the content of an uploaded book (in PDF format) and a user-defined goal. The instructions are structured so that the AI can:\n\n1. Understand its role and the desired outcome.\n2. Clearly define what kind of input it needs.\n3. Offer context and highlight key concepts from the book relevant to the user's goal.\n4. State any rules or constraints for the prompt creation.\n5. Lay out a step-by-step procedure for generating the prompt.\n6. Provide examples if available in the file.\n\n### Example: What would be sent to the API?\n\nThe API would receive a JSON object with the field \"request\" containing the detailed markdown and instructions you wrote. The API is expected to process this and return a response—likely a tailored prompt template or guide based on the book and user goal.\n\n### If you want to use this for your own workflow:\n\n1. Replace https://api.example.com/process with the actual endpoint you want to use.\n2. Ensure your API can interpret and act on such detailed instructions.\n3. Adapt the prompt as needed for your specific task or AI assistant.\n\n---\n\n**If you have a specific file (book PDF) and a goal in mind, you would:**\n\n- Upload the PDF as required by the system.\n- Specify your goal (e.g., \"Summarize each chapter for actionable insights for managers\").\n- Use this prompt structure to instruct the AI to generate a tailored, high-quality prompt or response.\n\n---\n\n**Let me know if you need:**\n- A more detailed explanation of any part of the process\n- Help adapting this prompt for a specific book or goal\n- Sample expected output from the API\n\nJust ask!",

          "response": "It looks like you’ve set up a request that sends instructions for creating a “Super GPT prompt” from a book or PDF. However, this snippet by itself doesn’t include the actual PDF text or a stated goal for the prompt. Below is an overview of what’s happening in your request and what you might do next:\n\n1. You are sending a POST request to “https://api.example.com/process” with a JSON body containing a field called “request.”  \n2. The content of “request” instructs the receiving service (or model) to adopt the role “SuperPrompter GPT,” and it lays out guidelines for creating an advanced prompt from a given text (in this case, presumably a PDF of a book).  \n3. The instructions explain that once a user gives their goal, the system should write a detailed prompt including:  \n   • Clearly defined input.  \n   • Descriptive context (derived from the book).  \n   • Rules to accomplish the user’s specified task.  \n   • A step-by-step procedure for completing the goal.  \n   • Relevant examples from the book, if available.  \n\nSince the actual PDF content and user’s goal are not yet provided in this snippet, here is how you can proceed:\n\n• Provide or reference the PDF’s content. Since the instructions say “only talk about stuff that is in the file,” the system will need the actual text of the book (or at least an excerpt) to highlight concepts and examples.  \n• Specify the user’s goal or the task they want to accomplish. This is essential because the instructions center on creating a context-specific prompt aligned with that goal.  \n\nOnce you supply the PDF text (or summary) and the user’s goal, your service (or ChatGPT) can construct a prompt that follows the structure mentioned in your snippet:\n\nExample prompt structure (after you’ve provided the actual PDF/goal):  \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nPrompt Title: [Descriptive Title Based on Goal]\n\nRole: “You are SuperPrompter GPT.”\n\nGoal: [The user’s stated goal or objective]\n\n[1] Clearly Defined Input  \n▸ Describe what kind of input the user must provide.  \n▸ Example: “Input the specific chapter or section of the book you want to analyze.”\n\n[2] Descriptive Context (from the PDF)  \n▸ Summarize or highlight key points from the provided text that directly relate to the user’s goal.  \n▸ Emphasize any crucial concepts, terms, or examples from the book.\n\n[3] Rules to Accomplish the Task  \n▸ List constraints, guidelines, or domain-specific instructions that keep the work aligned with the user’s objective.  \n▸ Example: “Do not reference sections of the book that are not related to the user’s query,” or “Use bullet points for clarity.”\n\n[4] Step-by-Step Procedure to Accomplish the Task  \n▸ Break down each major step from start to finish.  \n▸ Example:  \n   1. Identify the chapter/section relevant to the user’s query.  \n   2. Extract key ideas and context.  \n   3. Formulate actionable insights or next steps.  \n   4. Restate the final conclusion or set of recommendations.\n\n[5] Examples (if available in the file)  \n▸ Provide concise examples that illustrate how to complete the task.  \n▸ Example: “Here’s how it looks if you want to extract marketing tips from Chapter 3...”\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nIn short, the snippet you showed is a template or blueprint for how you want to generate specialized prompts from book content. If your goal is to implement this, the next step is to provide:  \n• The actual PDF text (or relevant excerpts).  \n• The user’s specific objective or question.  \n\nWith those details, you can generate a final, context-rich “Super GPT Prompt” as described in your JSON payload.",

Clearly Defined Input:\n   • Specify that the user must provide the original book in PDF format.\n   • State that the user must also provide the exact goal or objective that should be turned into a prompt.\n\n2. Descriptive Context:\n   • Summarize that the file is “Book to Prompt – Turn Any Book into Actionable Prompts,” which explains the process of converting any book into actionable instructions or prompts.\n   • Highlight that the file originates from Lucas C Pimentel and directs users to the workflow available on chat.openai.com.\n   • Explain that understanding the detailed structure of the book (its themes, arguments, or narratives) is crucial to craft a relevant and effective prompt for achieving the user’s goal.\n\n3. Rules to Accomplish the Task:\n   • Base all prompt elements solely on the provided file content and the user’s stated objective.\n   • Only incorporate details directly mentioned in the file (i.e., book upload process, goal declaration, and basic instructions).\n   • Ensure clarity and precision: every instruction must relate directly to transforming the book’s content to actionable tasks.\n   • Do not include extraneous concepts or details beyond the contents of the file.\n\n4. Step-by-Step Procedure to Accomplish the Task:\n   Step 1: Request the PDF of the book from the user.\n   Step 2: Ask the user to clearly state the goal they wish to have transformed into a prompt.\n   Step 3: Analyze the file’s key aspects (e.g., central themes, structure, and notable excerpts) to form the contextual base.\n   Step 4: Identify important concepts that align with the user’s goal, ensuring these are well explained.\n   Step 5: Arrange the final prompt by sequentially appending:\n      – The input requirements;\n      – The relevant context derived from the book;\n      – The rules that will guide the task fulfillment;\n      – The systematic, step-by-step process;\n      – Example(s) (if available) that illustrate how the prompt should produce actionable outcomes.\n   Step 6: Present the complete prompt back to the user for verification.\n\n5. Examples:\n   • If the book discusses personal productivity strategies and the user’s goal is “to build a daily self-improvement routine,” then the generated prompt should include concrete examples from the book (e.g., daily planning techniques, motivational quotes) that illustrate how to develop and follow a routine.\n   • In cases where the file provides multiple actionable ideas, showcase a sample breakdown of instructions that integrate the ideas into a cohesive, step-by-step guide.\n\n────────────────────────\nWhen using the above template, remember that your output must reflect only the information available in the file “Book to Prompt” and align strictly with the user’s provided goal. This method ensures that the transformation of the book content into actionable prompts remains consistent and focused.\n\n────────────────────────\nEnd of Prompt\n\nThis final output adheres strictly to the guidelines given in the file, ensuring a systematic framework for creating a Super GPT prompt based on any book's content.",

Save the JSON payload into a file called `payload.json`:\n```json\n{\n  \"request\": \"## Book to Prompt\\nTurn Any Book into Actionable Prompts. 1. Upload the PDF of a book 2.

Then run the curl command referencing the file:\n```bash\ncurl -X POST https://api.example.com/process \\\n  -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\\n  -d @payload.json\n```\n\nWhy this works:\n\n- JSON strings containing special characters, especially quotes (`\"`), backticks (`` ` ``), and newlines (`\\n`) become difficult to handle directly in command-line curl commands.  \n- Saving the JSON payload in a separate file ensures correct escaping, readability, and avoids errors caused by shell parsing or incorrect escaping.\n\nIf, however, you must include it directly as a command-line argument without external files (which is less advisable), you must escape the payload correctly. For instance:\n\n```bash\ncurl -X POST https://api.example.com/process \\\n  -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\\n  -d '{\"request\":\"## Book to Prompt\\nTurn Any Book into Actionable Prompts. 1.

Uploading a PDF of a book.  \n  2. Stating your goal to be turned into a prompt.\n\nImportant concept:  \n• The process involves identifying relevant parts of the book in relation to the user’s stated goal and crafting those elements into a targeted, step-by-step prompt.\n\nRULES TO ACCOMPLISH THE TASK:\n1. Only utilize details explicitly available in the provided PDF or any additional context the user shares.  \n2. Keep the user’s stated goal at the forefront when synthesizing actionable prompts.  \n3. Maintain clarity and conciseness—retain only the essential details from the text that serve the goal.  \n4. Respect any constraints given by the user about which sections of the book to emphasize or ignore.\n\nSTEP-BY-STEP PROCEDURE:\n1. Receive the PDF (or a thorough summary) of the book from the user.  \n2. Identify and extract key ideas, chapters, or concepts relevant to the user’s goal.  \n3. Map each relevant idea to a specific action the user can take.  \n4. Refine these ideas into concise, actionable prompts that address the user’s objective.  \n5. Review the prompts for accuracy, clarity, and alignment with the user’s stated goal.  \n6. Present the final, actionable prompts to the user, ensuring they are easy to follow.\n\nEXAMPLES:\n• If the user’s goal is to apply productivity strategies from a self-help book, highlight each principle (e.g., “Prioritize tasks”) and turn it into an actionable prompt (e.g., “Create a daily list of your top three priorities before starting work”).  \n• If the user’s goal is to learn how to cook from a recipe book, transform each section (e.g., “Preparing ingredients”) into a direct, prompt-based action plan (e.g., “List all ingredients required for the dish and break them into prep tasks such as chopping or marinating”).\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nUse this structured prompt template when you want to help a user convert the content of any PDF book into focused, actionable prompts that align with their particular goal.",

It reflects only the content explicitly present in the file snippet, which focuses on turning any book into actionable prompts by (1) uploading a PDF and (2) identifying a goal to be turned into a prompt.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nROLE:\n\"You are SuperPrompter GPT.\"\n\nTASK/GOAL:\n\"Your goal is to help me create a Super GPT prompt based on the context of the file I will give you.\"\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n1. CLEARLY DEFINED INPUT:\n   - A digital book or PDF file of any length (uploaded by the user).\n   - A clearly stated goal or desired outcome the user wants to achieve through the text of the book (e.g., summarizing, extracting lessons, or generating specific content).\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n2. DESCRIPTIVE CONTEXT:\n   - This prompt is derived from the concept of “## Book to Prompt: Turn Any Book into Actionable Prompts,” authored by Lucas C Pimentel.\n   - The essential idea is to take the content of a book (in PDF form) and transform it into a set of actionable goals or steps that align with a user-defined objective.\n   - The user’s role is to provide the PDF and a specific “goal” (e.g., “Generate a chapter summary,” “Help me create a study plan,” “Draft a set of important quotes,” etc.).\n\nKey Concept Emphasized in the File:\n   • Focus on converting the book’s content into prompts that directly address the user’s goal.  \n   • The user should always provide the PDF of the book and the precise goal for the transformation to be meaningful.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n3. RULES TO ACCOMPLISH THE TASK:\n   1. Only use the information provided within the PDF and the user’s stated goal—do not rely on external sources.  \n   2. Maintain the user’s preferred style or formatting requirements, if specified.  \n   3. The prompts generated should be actionable, meaning they guide or produce practical outputs rather than generic summaries.\n   4. The user must provide a clear, specific goal. If the goal is unclear or too broad, ask for clarification before proceeding.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n4. STEP-BY-STEP PROCEDURE TO ACCOMPLISH THE TASK:\n   Step 1: Receive and process the PDF file (the book).  \n   Step 2: Identify the user’s specific goal (e.g., summarization, lesson extraction, etc.).  \n   Step 3: Scan or parse the book’s major themes, chapters, or sections relevant to the user’s goal.  \n   Step 4: Convert those relevant sections into precise, actionable prompts that address the user’s goal.  \n   Step 5: Provide the final structured prompts (or instruction sets) that help drive the user toward achieving their stated outcome.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n5. EXAMPLES (Hypothetical, for Illustration):\n   - Example Goal: “I want a short summary of each chapter to use in my blog posts.”  \n     Generated Prompt: “Please summarize each chapter from the PDF, focusing on key arguments, essential data, and any notable takeaways that would be interesting in a blog post format.”\n\n   - Example Goal: “I want to create a reading comprehension test for each major section.”  \n     Generated Prompt: “For each major section in the PDF, create at least five questions that help assess comprehension of the main ideas, along with the correct answers.”\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nFINAL SUPER GPT PROMPT TEMPLATE:\n\nYou are SuperPrompter GPT.\n\nYour goal is to help me create a Super GPT prompt based on the context of the file I will give you.\n\nI will start by giving you the role and the task/goal of the prompt I want to create.\n\nThen, you will append to the prompt:\n\n1) Clearly defined input — (Include the uploaded PDF of the book and user’s specific goal here.)\n2) Descriptive context — (Describe the user’s goal and how it applies to the book’s content.)\n3) Rules to accomplish the task — (List constraints, must stay within the content, etc.)\n4) Step-by-step procedure — (Show how to parse the book, isolate relevant information, and create prompts.)\n5) Examples — (Offer examples relevant to the user’s stated goal.)\n\nPlease remember:\n• Highlight important concepts relevant to the user’s stated goal.  \n• Be precisely descriptive but only talk about stuff in the file.

The prompt is constructed solely using the information from the file you provided, incorporating all necessary sections with clear instructions, descriptive context, rules, and a systematic process.\n\n────────────────────────────\nSuper GPT Prompt: Transforming a Book into Actionable Prompts\n\nRole Description:\n• You are SuperPrompter GPT, tasked with generating a new prompt that will help convert the input book (PDF) into easily actionable tasks.\n\nTask/Goal:\n• The goal is to turn a given book into detailed, step-by-step actionable prompts that help achieve a dedicated task or goal, while clearly detailing the required input, context, processing rules, and examples.\n\n────────────────────────────\n1. Clearly Defined Input:\n• Input needed: A PDF file containing the book.\n• Additional detail: The file should contain all the relevant content necessary for extracting task-related concepts. The content must be in a readable PDF format.\n\n────────────────────────────\n2. Descriptive Context:\n• Description: The goal is to convert the narrative or instructional contents of a book into a well-structured prompt that outlines specific actions. The description in the file explains that this process involves understanding the book’s concepts and then turning them into step-by-step procedures for carrying out a set goal.\n• Key Concepts from the Book:\n – PDF Upload: The file is provided in PDF format.\n – Goal/Task Conversion: The book’s information is translated into actionable steps.\n – Concept Extraction: Identification of important notions, guidelines, or methodologies included in the book that are necessary for completing the task.\n• Example of implicit context:\n – Complexity Analysis (Time Complexity O(n) and Space Complexity O(1)) shows that while processing the book, the algorithm remains efficient.\n – Algorithmic Approach (initialize parameters, process input data, then generate output) factors into the step-wise procedure of the prompt.\n\n────────────────────────────\n3. Rules to Accomplish the Task:\n• The input must be strictly a PDF file containing the complete book.\n• Only information that is explicitly given in the book (file) should be used to create the prompt.\n• The prompt must not include extraneous information beyond what is provided in the file.\n• Rules and procedures mentioned (such as complexity and algorithmic approaches) should guide the prompt creation, ensuring each step logically follows from the previous one.\n• Any constraints on input (e.g., file format and content visibility) must be adhered to in all instructions.\n\n────────────────────────────\n4. Step-by-Step Procedure to Accomplish the Task:\nStep 1: Initialization\n • Confirm that a PDF file has been uploaded.\n • Identify the primary goal provided (the book-to-actionable prompt goal).\nStep 2: Processing the Input Data\n • Open and parse the PDF to extract all relevant text.\n • Highlight key concepts, guidelines, and instructions that are essential for achieving the goal.\nStep 3: Constructing the Prompt\n • Clearly define the input expected (the PDF file and, if needed, any other text).\n • Provide a descriptive context that includes the book’s background, the task’s objectives, and central concepts (e.g., actionable steps).\n • Enumerate any rules or constraints that dictate how the task should be done.\n • List an ordered, step-by-step guide on how to process the book’s information and convert it to actionable prompts.\nStep 4: Integrating Examples\n • If applicable, extract example scenarios or algorithmic approaches from the book to illustrate the process.\n • Include examples such as the provided complexity analysis, ensuring clarity and reference.\nStep 5: Finalizing the Prompt\n • Review all sections for consistency with the uploaded file.\n • Ensure the final prompt is self-contained and instructive.\n\n────────────────────────────\n5. Examples (Derived from the File):\nExample 1: Complexity and Algorithmic Guidelines\n • Complexity Analysis:\n  – Time Complexity: O(n)\n  – Space Complexity: O(1)\n • Algorithmic Steps:\n  1. Initialize parameters.\n  2. Process input data.\n  3. Generate output.\nExample 2: Concept Highlighting\n • The input (PDF book) must exclusively provide the needed data. Do not use external sources or assumptions.\n • The context should comprehensively explain the actionable tasks based solely on the provided content.\n\n────────────────────────────\nAdditional Important Concepts:\n• Clarity and precision are key – every section (input, context, rules, procedure, and examples) must reflect only what is in the file.\n• The transformation process is methodical: it starts with verifying the input, extracting necessary data, then turning that data into a structured, step-by-step prompt.\n\n────────────────────────────\nFinal Notes:\n• This Super GPT prompt ensures that the transformation of any uploaded book into actionable prompts is systematic and reproducible.\n• It leverages the clear guidelines from the file and organizes them into a logical, step-by-step procedure.\n\n────────────────────────────\nBy following this comprehensive structure, SuperPrompter GPT will generate a precise, well-contextualized prompt that faithfully converts the provided book’s content into actionable instructions.",

Here's a breakdown and explanation of what your configuration does, and how it operates:\n\nWhat Your Configuration Does\n\n- Purpose: It is designed to turn any book (via PDF upload) into actionable, well-structured prompts for a Super GPT (SuperPrompter GPT).\n- Workflow: The user uploads a book and specifies a goal. The system then builds a detailed prompt for GPT based on the content of the uploaded file and the user's stated goal.\n- Structure: The prompt created by SuperPrompter GPT must include:\n  1. Clearly defined input: Specifies exactly what kind of input is needed for the prompt.\n  2. Descriptive context: Uses content from the uploaded book to explain the goal/task, highlighting crucial concepts and context to make the prompt more effective.\n  3. Rules: Lists any rules or constraints for the task.\n  4. Step-by-step procedure: Detailed, logical steps to achieve the task.\n  5. Examples: Concrete examples from the book, if available.\n- Rules for Prompter: Only use information from the file, be precise and descriptive, and focus on relevant concepts from the text.\n\nHow to Use This System\n\n- Upload your PDF book.\n- Clearly state your goal or the prompt you want to create (e.g., \"Summarize each chapter for a study guide\", \"Create quiz questions from chapters 1-5\", etc.).\n- SuperPrompter GPT then analyzes the book, extracts relevant information, and creates a highly structured prompt following the rules above.\n\nSample Output Structure (from your configuration)\n\nSuppose you uploaded a book on psychology and your goal is: \"Create a prompt to summarize each chapter's main idea in two sentences\".\n\nHere’s an example of what the SuperPrompter GPT would generate:\n\n1. **Input:**  \n   - PDF file of the book  \n   - Specific chapter number(s) to summarize\n\n2. **Descriptive context:**  \n   - This prompt focuses on extracting the main idea from each chapter.\n   - Main ideas are the central concepts or arguments presented by the author.\n   - Summaries should be concise, accurate, and use the book's own language where possible.\n\n3. **Rules:**  \n   - Summaries must not exceed two sentences per chapter.\n   - Only use information actually present in the chapter.\n   - Avoid personal interpretation or outside information.\n\n4. **Procedure:**  \n   Step 1: Read the specified chapter carefully.  \n   Step 2: Identify the central argument or theme.  \n   Step 3: Paraphrase the main idea in your own words, using no more than two sentences.  \n   Step 4: Repeat for each chapter as needed.\n\n5. **Examples:**  \n   - Chapter 1: \"The author introduces the concept of cognitive dissonance, explaining how people experience discomfort when their beliefs and actions conflict. This sets the stage for exploring how individuals rationalize their behavior.\"\n   - Chapter 2: ...\n\nSummary\n\nYour XML config sets up an automated workflow for converting books into expertly crafted prompts, ensuring that the resulting prompts are rich in context, rules, and examples—all directly informed by the source material.\n\nIf you need help customizing this workflow, integrating it with other tools, or writing actual prompts for specific books, let me know!",

Since the file describes a method called “Book to Prompt” (authored by Lucas C. Pimentel) for turning any book into actionable prompts, the template focuses on that method and does not introduce information from outside the file.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nROLE:\nYou are “SuperPrompter GPT,” a specialized AI assistant designed to guide users through creating precise, actionable prompts from any given source text.\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nTASK/GOAL:\nHelp the user turn a book (provided as a PDF) into an actionable prompt that aligns with the user’s specific goal.\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n1) CLEARLY DEFINED INPUT:\n   • A PDF file containing the book or text.  \n   • A short description of the user’s goal (what they want to achieve by prompting with this book’s content).\n\n2) DESCRIPTIVE CONTEXT:\n   Based on the file, the “Book to Prompt” approach involves:  \n   • Uploading the PDF of a book to extract its content.  \n   • Focusing on the user’s goal to shape how the book’s information will be turned into a prompt.  \n   This method was created by Lucas C. Pimentel and is meant to streamline the process of generating actionable prompts from lengthy or complex text.  \n\n   Important concepts:  \n   • Actionable Prompts: These are prompts that provide clear steps or tasks and draw on relevant information from the source text.  \n   • User Goal: The specific outcome or direction the user wants to pursue with the text’s content (for instance, summarizing insights, creating a plan, or learning a particular skill).  \n\n3) RULES TO ACCOMPLISH THE TASK:\n   • Only reference material directly from the PDF/book—avoid introducing unrelated or external information.  \n   • Align the generated prompt with the user’s stated goal.  \n   • Provide descriptive prompts that clearly instruct an AI to do something specific with the book’s content.  \n   • Maintain clarity and conciseness to ensure the outcome is actionable.  \n\n4) STEP-BY-STEP PROCEDURE TO ACCOMPLISH THE TASK:\n   1. Obtain the PDF of the book.  \n   2. Identify the user’s goal (e.g., to create a study guide, develop a summary, plan, etc.).  \n   3. Scan the book’s key sections, focusing on chapters or topics relevant to the user’s goal.  \n   4. Extract crucial concepts, terms, examples, or data from those relevant sections.  \n   5. Formulate a prompt that:  \n      • Clearly states the user’s goal.  \n      • Incorporates the chosen key concepts from the book.  \n      • Outlines any specific instructions or constraints (e.g., “in under 300 words,” “only facts, no opinions”).  \n   6. Refine the prompt for clarity and scope, ensuring it remains aligned with the user’s goal.  \n   7. (Optional) Provide examples if any sections of the book illustrate use cases or practical applications.  \n\n5) EXAMPLES:\n   • Currently, the file itself does not provide explicit examples of final prompts.  \n   • An illustrative hypothetical example might be:  \n     “You are an AI tutor. Using Chapter 3 of [Book Title], where the author explains time management methods, create a one-week actionable plan that applies only the book’s recommended strategies to help a student balance study and rest.”  \n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nFINAL SUPER GPT PROMPT STRUCTURE (EXAMPLE TEMPLATE):\n\n“You are SuperPrompter GPT. My role is [User’s Role], and I want to accomplish [User’s Goal] using the book [Book Title] by [Author].  \n\n[INPUT]:\n1) PDF of [Book Title] by [Author].  \n2) My specific goal is: [User Goal].\n\n[DESCRIPTIVE CONTEXT]:\nAccording to the ‘Book to Prompt’ approach by Lucas C. Pimentel, we extract actionable prompts from the book based on the user’s goal. Focus on the parts most relevant to this goal.\n\n[RULES]:\n1) Only use information from the uploaded PDF.  \n2) Align your response with my goal without adding external details.  \n3) Provide a concise, actionable outcome.\n\n[STEP-BY-STEP PROCEDURE]:\n1) Identify key information in the text related to my goal.  \n2) Summarize or extract the main points.  \n3) Formulate an actionable plan or summary.  \n4) Refine to meet my specified constraints (like word limit or format).\n\n[EXAMPLES]:  \n(Include any relevant examples from the text if available.)  \n\nNow, please produce the final actionable prompt using this structure.”\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nUse this template as a guide whenever you want to turn the content of a book into a clear, targeted prompt.",

It’s structured to help transform the content of any book (provided, for example, as a PDF) into a clear, actionable prompt.\n\n──────────────────────────────\nFINAL SUPER GPT PROMPT:\n\nYou are SuperPrompter GPT. Your mission is to help transform the content of a given book into an actionable, precise prompt that can guide users to attain their specific goals. In this role, you must consider both the structural content of the book and the intended target outcome described by the user.\n\n1. Clearly Defined Input:\n • Expect two key pieces of input:\n  a. The PDF upload of the book.\n  b. A description of the goal or task that must be turned into a prompt.\n • The PDF input provides the supporting context, and the user’s expressed goal determines what aspects of the book need to be highlighted.\n\n2. Descriptive Context:\n • The goal is to distill actionable insights from the book’s content, transforming narrative or informative text into a set of concrete instructions.\n • Key concepts to consider include:\n  – Extraction: Isolating important ideas, themes, and methodologies from the book.\n  – Actionability: Reworking the extracted content into steps or guidelines that users can easily follow.\n  – Relevance: Aligning the extracted content with the specific goal provided by the user.\n • The prompt should ensure that every part of the book’s content used is directly relevant to the end goal.\n\n3. Rules to Accomplish the Task:\n • Only use information present in the uploaded file.\n • The goal and context provided by the user must directly influence which parts of the book are used.\n • Highlight important concepts, explanations, and methodologies mentioned in the book to ensure the final prompt is both accurate and actionable.\n • Adhere strictly to the file content—avoid assumptions or extraneous details not supported by the file.\n\n4. Step-by-Step Procedure to Accomplish the Task:\n Step 1: Receive the PDF and the user-defined goal.\n Step 2: Review the entire content of the book to identify themes, methodologies, and actionable sections.\n Step 3: Break down the key ideas into individual, self-contained steps that match the user’s desired outcome.\n Step 4: Outline a clear, sequential procedure combining extracted ideas from the book with specific instructions tied to the user’s goal.\n Step 5: Compile examples or case scenarios (if available within the book) to illustrate how the actionable steps can be implemented.\n Step 6: Review the prompt for clarity and ensure that every part relates back to both the book’s details and the user’s goal.\n\n5. Examples:\n • Example 1: If the book details methods for time management, structure the prompt to include actionable steps such as “Prioritize tasks based on urgency and importance” and then detail each step based on the book’s recommendations.\n • Example 2: If the book offers strategies for creative thinking, the prompt might include guided exercises like “Brainstorm without judgment for 10 minutes” followed by instructions on organizing and refining the ideas, as derived directly from the book’s methodology.\n\n──────────────────────────────\nImportant Concepts Explained:\n • Input Specificity: Emphasizing that the process needs both a concrete file and a clear goal ensures that the transformation from book content to actionable prompts is tightly focused.\n • Actionability: The core purpose is not just summarization, but converting readings into clear, sequential steps.\n • Relevance: Every piece of output should have an explicit link to the user’s objective, ensuring that the final prompt is both useful and directly tied to the source material.\n\nBy following this structure, SuperPrompter GPT can accurately and efficiently convert any book’s content into a detailed, actionable prompt tailored to the user’s specified purpose.\n\n──────────────────────────────\nThis is the complete Super GPT prompt based solely on the content and rules provided in the configuration file.",

Present the final actionable prompts clearly, ready for the user to apply.  \n\nEXAMPLES (Illustrative, based on the “Book to Prompt” concept):\n1. If a user wants to develop a daily habit from a self-improvement book, you would:  \n   • Identify passages discussing habit formation.  \n   • Summarize the main method.  \n   • Turn these into daily, targeted prompts (e.g., “At 8 am, write down one new habit you want to solidify this week based on the author’s 5-step habit-forming approach”).  \n\n2. If a user wants to apply new marketing strategies from a business book, you would:  \n   • Locate chapters explaining specific marketing tactics.  \n   • Summarize the steps and relevant tips.  \n   • Create prompts that guide the user to implement these tactics (e.g., “Create a 200-word test ad following the author’s 3-part framework and list key performance indicators before launch”).  \n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nHOW TO USE THIS TEMPLATE\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n1. Replace or supplement any placeholder text (like “the PDF or text excerpt of a book”) with the actual book content you have.  \n2. Replace the goal in the “Descriptive Context” with your specific outcome or focus.  \n3. Follow the “Step-by-Step Procedure” to ensure your prompts fully reflect the core concepts from the book without straying beyond its content.",

This prompt is designed to guide you in turning any book (via its PDF) into a fully actionable prompt. Note that every section is crafted by strictly referring to the file details.\n\n─────────────────────────────  \nSuper GPT Prompt (Based on “Book to Prompt”)\n\nRole:  \n  You are SuperPrompter GPT. Your task is to help create an advanced Super GPT prompt using the context from the provided file (the PDF of a book) along with a clear goal.\n\nClearly Defined Input:  \n  • The exact input required is a PDF file of a book.  \n  • Additionally, a clear description of the task/goal must be provided. For example, specify if the goal is to summarize, analyze, or generate actionable steps based on the book’s content.\n\nDescriptive Context:  \n  • The file outlines a method to convert a book’s content into specific, actionable prompts.  \n  • The objective is to transform the book into a structure that includes:  \n   – A description of the goal or main task derived from the book’s content.  \n   – A breakdown of important concepts that are necessary to fully understand and reach that goal.  \n  • Key concepts include:  \n   – Uploading a PDF file to deliver content context.  \n   – Clearly stating the desired goal (e.g., summarizing chapters, extracting actionable steps, etc.).  \n   – Drawing out essential themes and concepts that are intrinsic to the book’s content.  \n  • The context ensures that the prompt contains a clear mapping between the book’s content and the actionable targets required for the task.\n\nRules to Accomplish the Task:  \n  1. Begin by stating your role as SuperPrompter GPT and providing the overall goal/task for which the prompt is to be created.  \n  2. Only refer to and use information explicitly mentioned in the file. Do not add extraneous details.  \n  3. Ensure that the input consists solely of the PDF file and a clear goal statement.  \n  4. Clearly explain why each important concept (e.g., PDF upload, goal description) is necessary to achieve an accurate and actionable prompt.  \n  5. Follow any input constraints provided: the task must strictly correlate to the content and structure as outlined in the file.\n\nStep-by-Step Procedure to Accomplish the Task:  \n  Step 1: Receive and verify two inputs:  \n    a. A PDF file containing the book’s content.  \n    b. A detailed description of the goal (e.g., summarization, actionable insight extraction, etc.).  \n  Step 2: Read the provided role and task/goal to set the overall direction for prompt creation.  \n  Step 3: Identify and list all crucial concepts from the file that will guide the prompt, ensuring you highlight why each is important for context.  \n  Step 4: Formulate the section for “Clearly Defined Input” by specifying the exact data needed (i.e., PDF file and task goal).  \n  Step 5: Develop a “Descriptive Context” section that explains how the book’s content informs the actionable goal.  \n  Step 6: List any rules that must be followed so that the prompt is precise and actionable, keeping in line with the instructions.  \n  Step 7: Outline a clear, step-by-step procedure detailing how the task is to be achieved, ensuring each step logically follows the previous one.  \n  Step 8: Finally, if the file contains any examples (or if you can derive examples from its structure), incorporate these to further illustrate expectations.\n\nExamples (if applicable from the file):  \n  • Example Input:  \n    \"PDF File: 'BookTitle.pdf'  \n    Goal: 'Extract key actionable insights from each chapter for a quick reference guide.'\"  \n  • Example Output within the prompt should demonstrate how to delineate sections such as Input, Context, Rules, and the Step-by-Step Procedure.\n\n─────────────────────────────  \nInstructions Recap:  \nBased solely on the file’s content, your output (i.e., the Super GPT prompt) must include a clearly defined input section, a detailed descriptive context explaining the goal in relation to the file, explicit rules that constrain the process, an ordered step-by-step procedure, and examples if available. Always highlight important concepts to provide better clarity and context for the prompt’s creation.\n\nUse this Super GPT prompt structure when turning the book's PDF and your stated goal into a complete, actionable prompt.",

CLEARLY DEFINED INPUT:\n   - A PDF of the book.\n   - A concise statement of the user’s goal (what they want to achieve or explore using the book’s content).\n\n2. DESCRIPTIVE CONTEXT:\n   According to the file “Book to Prompt: Turn Any Book into Actionable Prompts” by Lucas C Pimentel, the fundamental approach is:\n   • You can upload the PDF of a book.  \n   • You specify your goal—what you hope to accomplish or learn.  \n   • The system then utilizes the text of the book to craft prompts that align with your stated goal.\n\n   Key concept to highlight:\n   • Uploading the PDF: Ensures the entire text of the book is accessible for reference.  \n   • Defining the goal: Serves as the lighthouse guiding how prompts should be shaped and tailored.\n\n3. RULES TO ACCOMPLISH THE TASK:\n   1) Only use information from the uploaded book.  \n   2) Keep prompts aligned with the user’s stated goal.  \n   3) Do not introduce unrelated information that isn’t in the provided PDF.  \n   4) Make prompts practical, clear, and relevant to the user’s intended outcome.\n\n4. STEP-BY-STEP PROCEDURE:\n   1) Receive the PDF file and confirm it has been uploaded successfully.  \n   2) Read or parse the PDF’s text to identify main ideas, themes, and sections related to the user’s goal.  \n   3) Highlight or note the key points, insights, or methods in the book that could help the user achieve their goal.  \n   4) Based on the user’s stated goal, craft a series of prompts or questions that enable deeper exploration of the text, encourage action, or guide reflection.  \n   5) Present these prompts in an organized format so the user can proceed step by step (e.g., from basic comprehension to practical application).\n\n5. EXAMPLES:\n   The file does not provide explicit examples. However, an example workflow can be inferred:\n   - If the user wants to “develop a lesson plan” from the book, the prompts would focus on extracting teaching strategies, relevant anecdotes, or structured learning activities directly from the text.\n\nPlease abide by and incorporate the above points for the most effective Super GPT prompt and ensure every prompt remains faithful to the contents of the uploaded PDF.\n```",

This explanation describes how to transform a book (provided as a PDF) and a user-specified task/goal into an actionable Super GPT prompt.\n – Returns: A ProcessingResult object that encapsulates the newly constructed prompt based on the file’s context.\n – Throws: A ValidationException if the input does not meet expected criteria.\n\n• How the request String Is Structured:\n 1. The file identification—in this case, “## Book to Prompt” followed by an explanation of how to use the service (upload a PDF, add a goal).\n 2. Authorship and source details (e.g., “By Lucas C Pimentel” and a URL).\n 3. A code block (using markdown format) that includes the instruction “You are SuperPrompter GPT” along with clear guidelines on how to extend the user-provided prompt. The guidelines include:\n  – Clearly defined input: Specifying what type of input is required.\n  – Descriptive context: A description of the goal or task derived from the file.\n  – Important concepts: Elaborating on crucial elements of the task/goal.\n  – Rules for the task: Any constraints or procedural guidelines.\n  – Step-by-step procedures: Specific, ordered steps to accomplish the task.\n  – Examples: Any examples provided from the file.\n\n• What processRequest() Does:\n – It reads the provided string and identifies the role (“SuperPrompter GPT”) and the basic structure needed to augment a user prompt.\n – It then appends to the original user’s prompt additional sections if not already present:\n  • Clearly defined input requirements.\n  • A descriptive context detailing the goal/task as inferred from the file.\n  • A list of rules that must be followed.\n  • A logical, step-by-step procedure to accomplish the task.\n  • Examples when available.\n – In doing so, it highlights and explains important concepts solely based on the content from the file. This ensures that the final Super GPT prompt is both actionable and precisely aligned with the content provided.\n\n• Example in Brief:\n Imagine the file contains an explanation for turning any book into actionable prompts. The helper (SuperPrompter GPT) will then take the prompt’s context (upload PDF and specify goal), and it will add:\n  – A defined request input (what exactly should the user provide).\n  – A detailed context (explaining the goal of transforming a book into a prompt).\n  – Key rules (like following the supplied procedural guidelines).\n  – A clear, ordered process to generate the final prompt.\n  – Any example prompt segments provided in the file.\n\nIn summary, the processRequest() method is designed to take a formatted text that explains a book-to-prompt conversion process, analyze its components, and generate a complete, structured prompt that “SuperPrompter GPT” can use to help generate actionable Super GPT prompts in a well-defined, stepwise manner.",

I’ll explain how the schema should process the given input, and what an ideal response would look like.\n\n## 1. GraphQL Schema Explanation\n\nYour schema defines a mutation for processing a request:\n\ntype Mutation {\n  processRequest(input: String!): ProcessingResult\n}\n\nThe input is a single String (in this case, a Markdown-formatted instruction and context). The mutation returns a ProcessingResult, which is:\n\ntype ProcessingResult {\n  success: Boolean!\n  message: String\n}\n\n## 2. What Your Input Is\n\nYour input string is a detailed Markdown prompt, including:\n\n- The purpose (turning a book into actionable prompts)\n- Instructions for the \"SuperPrompter GPT\"\n- A breakdown of the prompt structure (role, input, context, rules, procedure, examples)\n- Rules to follow (be descriptive, only use info from the file, highlight important concepts)\n- An example file link\n\n## 3. How the Processing Should Work\n\nWhen the processRequest mutation is called with this input, the backend (or whatever logic is behind processRequest) should:\n\n- Parse and understand the prompt.\n- Extract and/or validate that the prompt template and instructions are clear.\n- Optionally, check if all required sections (input, context, rules, procedure, examples) are present or ask for more info.\n- Return a success status and any relevant message (such as \"Prompt template received successfully.\" or \"Missing examples section in the prompt.\")\n\n## 4. Example Response\n\nHere’s what a response might look like if the processRequest mutation successfully processes this input:\n\n{\n  \"data\": {\n    \"processRequest\": {\n      \"success\": true,\n      \"message\": \"Prompt template received and parsed successfully. Awaiting file upload and goal to generate actionable prompts.\"\n    }\n  }\n}\n\nOr, if something is missing or wrong:\n\n{\n  \"data\": {\n    \"processRequest\": {\n      \"success\": false,\n      \"message\": \"Error: The prompt template is missing a step-by-step procedure section.\"\n    }\n  }\n}\n\n## 5. Example Usage\n\nHere’s an example GraphQL mutation you might send:\n\nmutation {\n  processRequest(input: \"\"\"\n    ## Book to Prompt\n    Turn Any Book into Actionable Prompts. ...\n    (rest of your markdown input)\n  \"\"\") {\n    success\n    message\n  }\n}\n\n## Summary\n\n- Your schema expects a Markdown-formatted string as input.\n- The processing logic should validate and process the structure of the prompt.\n- The response indicates success/failure and gives a relevant message.\n\nIf you need help with the backend logic for processRequest or want to see a code example for validation, let me know!",

          "response": "It looks like you've shared a highly specific and detailed regular expression pattern (regex) that aims to match a very particular, case-insensitive prompt template for turning books into actionable prompts, including markdown code blocks and rule lists.\n\nLet's break down what your regex is doing and offer some tips, since you mentioned the description and flags as well.\n\n## What This Regex Matches\n\n- The pattern is constructed to match a **very specific prompt structure**, possibly for prompt engineering or a chatbot instruction.\n- It looks for the phrase: \"## Book to prompt Turn any book into actionable prompts. 1. Upload the PDF of a book 2. Tell your goal to be turned into a prompt\", with all possible case combinations (using `[bB]`, `[oO]`, etc.).  \n- It then matches the author line, a URL, and a very detailed markdown code block explaining the prompt structure, step-by-step directions, and rules.\n- The use of `[bB]`, `[oO]`, etc., makes the regex **case-insensitive**, though the `i` flag would also achieve this for most engines.\n- The pattern expects **exact spacing and punctuation** (e.g., `\\s+`, literal periods, etc.).\n- **Flags**:  \n  - `g` (global): Find all matches, not just the first.  \n  - `i` (case-insensitive): Already partially redundant due to `[aA]` etc., but safer to keep.\n\n## What is it for?\n\nThis regex is so specific that it would only match a prompt that follows this **exact format**. It's likely for:\n\n- Validating that a prompt template has not been altered.\n- Extracting or flagging these special instructional sections from a larger document or prompt database.\n- Automatic processing of \"book-to-prompt\" instructions for an AI system.\n\n## Potential Issues\n\n- **Fragility**:  \n  Any small deviation (extra whitespace, missing period, typo, etc.) in the text will make the regex fail to match.\n- **Redundant Case Handling**:  \n  Since the `i` flag is used, all `[aA]` etc. could be replaced with just the letter (`a`), simplifying the regex.\n- **Hard to Maintain**:  \n  If the template changes, the regex must be re-written.\n\n## Suggestions\n\n1. **Simplify Case Handling**:  \n   If your regex engine supports it, just use the `i` flag and drop `[bB]` in favor of `b`, `[oO]` in favor of `o`, etc.\n   \n   For example,  \n   Instead of: `[bB][oO][oO][kK]`,  \n   Use: `book`\n   \n2. **Use Multiline and Dotall Flags**:  \n   If you need to match across lines, use the `m` and `s` flags.\n   \n   - `m` for multiline (`^` and `$` match start/end of lines)\n   - `s` for dotall (`.` matches newline)\n\n3. **Make it More Flexible**:  \n   If small variations are possible, consider making some spaces optional: `\\s*`, or matching variable text with `.*?` where appropriate.\n\n4. **Capture Groups**:  \n   If you want to extract certain sections (e.g., the rules list), use parentheses `()`.\n\n5. **Performance**:  \n   Very long regex patterns can be slow. Consider breaking the parsing into sections, or use less strict matching if possible.\n\n## Example (Simplified)\n\nSuppose you want to match this prompt, but with less rigidity:\n\n```regex\n##\\s+book\\s+to\\s+prompt\\s+turn any book into actionable prompts\\.\\s+1\\.\\s+upload the pdf of a book\\s+2\\.\\s+tell your goal to be turned into a prompt\nby lucas c pimentel\nhttps:\\/\\/chat\\.openai\\.com\\/g\\/g\\-h44gjgg77a00\\-book\\-to\\-prompt\n\n```markdown\nyou are superprompter gpt\\.\nyour goal is to help me create a supergpt prompt based on the context of the file i will give you\\.\n.*?please abide to the following rules:\n.*\n``` \n```\nWith flags: `/gis`\n\n- This will match the entire prompt, allowing for any content in the main body.\n- It is less strict and more maintainable.\n- You can further break out important sections with capture groups if needed.\n\n## Summary Table\n\n| Component     | Description                                                    |\n|---------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Pattern       | Matches a very specific book-to-prompt template                |\n| Use Case      | Validate/extract prompt instructions with strict formatting    |\n| Flags         | `gi` (global, case-insensitive); consider adding `s`/`m` if needed |\n| Cautions      | Very brittle, hard to maintain, redundant case handling        |\n| Suggestions   | Use `i` flag for case, make spacing more flexible, use capture groups |\n\n---\n\n### If you want help **modifying** this regex or writing a more flexible version, let me know your exact needs!",

PURPOSE & WHAT IT MATCHES\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n\n1) High-Level Purpose\n   • It looks for a very particular block of text that mentions:\n     – “## book to prompt” or “## Book to Prompt” (case-insensitive).\n     – Instructions on turning a book (especially a PDF) into prompts.\n     – References to “by lucas c pimentel” and a specific link (chat.openai.com/g/g-…).\n     – A markdown code-fence with the word “[mM][aA][rR][kK][dD][oO][wW][nN]” inside.\n     – A set of bullet points or enumerations describing how to process the text.\n\n2) Main Components\n   • \\#\\#\\s+[bB][oO][oO][kK]\\s+[tT][oO]\\s+[pP][rR][oO][mM][pP][tT]\n     This ensures the text begins with “## book to prompt” (case-insensitive).\n   • [tT][uU][rR][nN]\\s+[aA][nN][yY]\\s+[bB][oO][oO][kK]…\n     Continues matching the instruction “turn any book into actionable prompts…”.\n   • [11]\\.\\s+[uU][pP][lL][oO][aA][dD]\\s+[tT][hH][eE]\\s+[pP][dD][fF]…\n     Looks for “1. upload the PDF of…” (though it uses [11] to match both uppercase/lowercase “1” but is effectively just “1.”).\n   • [bB][yY]\\s+[lL][uU][cC][aA][sS]\\s+[cC]\\s+[pP][iI][mM][eE][nN][tT][eE][lL]\n     Matches “by lucas c pimentel” in a case-insensitive manner.\n   • [hH][tT][tT][pP][sS]\\:\\/\\/[cC][hH]…\n     Ensures the link to chat.openai.com is present and matches various letter cases.\n   • \\`\\`\\`[mM][aA][rR][kK][dD][oO][wW][nN]\n     Matches a code fence with the word “markdown.”\n\nOverall, the pattern is specifically crafted to detect a fairly long, multi-line chunk of text that references:\n• “## book to prompt”\n• instructions for converting a PDF book into prompts\n• a pointer to chat.openai.com\n• an introduction about providing context for a large prompt\n• enumerated or bulleted instructions about the user’s role and tasks in prompting\n\n3. FLAGS\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n• g (global): Finds all matches in the text, not just the first match.\n• i (case-insensitive): Allows matching of uppercase, lowercase, or any combination thereof, due to bracketed letters (e.g., [bB][oO][oO][kK]).\n\n4. USAGE EXAMPLES\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n\nExample A: In JavaScript\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nconst pattern = /\\#\\#\\s+[bB][oO][oO][kK]\\s+[tT][oO]\\s+[pP][rR][oO][mM][pP][tT]\\\\\n[tT][uU][rR][nN]\\s+[aA][nN][yY]\\s+[bB]…(rest of pattern)…/gi;\n\nconst text = `\n## Book To Prompt\nturn any book into actionable prompts. 1. upload ...\nby Lucas C Pimentel\nhttps://chat.openai.com/g/g-h4...\n\\`\\`\\`markdown\nYou are superprompter gpt...\n`;\n\nif (pattern.test(text)) {\n  console.log(\"Match found!\");\n} else {\n  console.log(\"No match.\");\n}\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nExample B: In Python\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nimport re\n\npattern = re.compile(\n    r\"\\#\\#\\s+[bB][oO][oO][kK]\\s+[tT][oO]\\s+[pP][rR][oO][mM][pP][tT]\\\\\"\n    r\"[tT][uU][rR][nN]\\s+[aA][nN][yY]\\s+[bB][oO][oO][kK]\\s+[iI][nN][tT][oO]\\s+[aA]...\"\n    r\"\\`\\`\\`[mM][aA][rR][kK][dD][oO][wW][nN]\"\n    , flags=re.IGNORECASE\n)\n\ntext = \"\"\"\n## book to prompt \nturn any book into actionable prompts. 1. upload ...\n...\n\"\"\"\n\nmatches = pattern.findall(text)\nprint(\"Matches:\", matches)\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n5. KEY TAKEAWAYS\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n• The pattern is very specialized. It specifically picks up a chunk of text describing a “Book to Prompt” process.  \n• Each bracketed pair ([bB], [oO], etc.) is a case-insensitivity workaround, in addition to the “i” flag.  \n• Because of the forced line breaks (with a literal backslash at the end in the pattern), you must ensure your test strings (or your multiline-matching logic) faithfully reproduce or allow those backslashes/newline patterns if you want the pattern to match exactly.  \n• If your use case only requires partial matching, you might consider simplifying the pattern to handle line breaks or spacing more flexibly.  \n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nDescription:  \nMatches text that follows a scripted set of instructions on how to transform a book/PDF into prompts, referencing “book to prompt,” enumerated steps, a mention of “by lucas c pimentel,” a link to chat.openai.com, and a code fence with “markdown” instructions.\n\nFlags:  \n• g (global) for finding all matches.  \n• i (case-insensitive) for ignoring case.  \n\nThat’s it! This pattern is tailored for a very particular text snippet relating to “## book to prompt” instructions and its subsequent explanation. If an incoming text exactly follows that structure—even with variations in uppercase/lowercase—it will be matched.",

          "response": "Below is an explanation of what this (very long) regular expression is doing.\n\n1. Purpose and Overview:\n • The regex is designed to match a very specific block of text related to a request for processing a “book to prompt” transformation. In other words, it “listens” for a command that starts with “## book to prompt turn any book into actionnable prompts.” and then goes on through a series of numbered instructions, sample text blocks, and finally a list of rules.\n • Although the regex itself manually “codes” a case‐insensitive match by writing each letter as a class (for example, [bB] instead of just “b”) the pattern is used together with the gi flags (global and case-insensitive) so the redundant per-letter classes could be simplified—but this version explicitly matches each character in both cases.\n\n2. Structure of the Pattern:\n a. Header and Command:\n  – The pattern begins with “##” followed by one or more whitespace characters.\n  – It then requires the literal words “book to prompt turn any book into actionnable prompts.” They are spelled out in extreme detail (each letter appears as two alternatives, e.g. [bB][oO][oO][kK] for “book”) making sure that even if the case is off, it will still match.\n  – Notice that after the command text there are numbered segments “11.” and “22.” each having specific instructions following them. For example:\n   • “11. upload the pdf of a book”\n   • “22. tell your goal to be turned into a prompt”\n\n b. URLs and Signatures:\n  – After the core command instructions, the regex then expects a URL that begins with “https://” followed by a specific domain and path. This is written in an equally detailed way with each letter bracketed, for example, [cC][hH][aA][tT] etc.\n  – There’s then a markdown block enclosed in triple backticks (```), which contains instructions or additional textual requirements. This text includes lines like “[markdown]” followed by a series of further instructions.\n\n c. Detailed Prompt Instructions:\n  – Inside this markdown block, the text lays out what “you” (the model) are expected to do (for example: “you are superprompting gpt.”)\n  – It then mentions that your goal is “to help me create a super gpt prompt based on the context of the file” that will be provided.\n  – There are further lines specifying that after being given the role and task, “you will append to the prompt a:” followed by various “- define input:” “- describe context:” etc. Each rule step is very explicitly spelled out.\n\n d. Rules and Examples:\n  – The pattern continues with a detailed list of rules that require a specific formatting (for example, “lay out a clear, ordered, proceeded for accomplishing the task with each step logically following from the last”).\n  – There is a section labeled “examples” that clarifies that if the file has them, it must “provide clear examples.”\n  – Finally, it includes an admonition to “please abide to the following rules:” and then even more detailed instructions.\n\n3. Matching Characteristics:\n • The regex is “hard-coded” to capture only one exact (but case‐insensitive) text. Every word, whitespace, punctuation, and URL part is spelled out, often using explicit character classes [xX] to match upper- and lower-case.\n • Because it uses the gi flags, the whole search is performed in a global, case-insensitive way.\n • The pattern assumes the text is structured in several line breaks (the pattern uses explicit whitespace escape sequences like \\s+ to capture spaces and line breaks).\n\n4. Usage Context:\n • Given its extreme specificity, this regex likely isn’t intended to be a general-purpose matcher. Instead, it’s used in a controlled environment where the input is known to conform to this structure (for example, an instruction parser used by a chat interface to switch into “superprompt” mode when the user supplies a specific command block).\n • Each segment (command, URL, markdown description, rules, examples) is exactly delimited so that if any part is even slightly off, the regex won’t match.\n\nIn summary, this regular expression is crafted to detect a very specific request for transforming “books to prompts” along with a highly detailed breakdown of tasks and context. It does so by matching every part of the message exactly (including case variants, spaces, punctuation, and even the provided URL), and is used with global, case-insensitive flags (gi).",
